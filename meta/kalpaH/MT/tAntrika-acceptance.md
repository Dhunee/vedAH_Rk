title = "tAntrika acceptance"

There were all kinds of accommodations & hybrid positions all the way from bhaTTa jayanta's time to today. The saiddhAntika-s like aghorashiva deshika insist that their votaries should observe vaidika rituals. Closer to our time a kaula like bhAskararAya also held the title of makhIndra. The choLa kings with saiddhAntika dIkSha performed shrautayAga-s. 

In the end many of the great tAntrika system's collapsed during the Mohammedan assault but the shrauta ritualists retained quite a degree of their vitality. It is remarkable that trika is almost gone in South India but still shrautayAga-s are done.
