counts of vR^iktabarhiSh

- maNDala 1 ... 5
- maNDala 3 ... 3
- maNDala 5 ... 3
- maNDala 6 ... 1
- maNDala 8 ... 11
- maNDala 9 ... 1
- maNDala 10 ... 2

clearly the kANva-s have a much greater propensity to us this phrase than others. 

Then vaishvAmitra-s & atri-s. Even in maNDala 1 of the 5, 1 is by the vaishvAmitra madhuChandas & 4 are by kANva-s include the founder of the clan kaNva himself. Thus totally the kANva-s have 15; vaishvAmitra-s 4 thereafter. Thus, the twisted grass though universal among v1s todaymight have had its origins in a specific sub-locale among the Arya-s probably close to the kANva heartland.
