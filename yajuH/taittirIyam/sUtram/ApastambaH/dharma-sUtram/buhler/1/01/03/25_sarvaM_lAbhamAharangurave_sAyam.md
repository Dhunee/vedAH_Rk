25. Bringing all he obtains to his teacher, he shall go begging with a vessel in the morning and in the evening, (and he may) beg (from everybody) except low-caste people unfit for association (with Āryas) and Abhiśastas. [^9]  A Brāhmaṇa declares: Since a devout student takes away from women, who refuse (to give him alms, the merit gained) by (Śrauta)-sacrifices, by gifts, (and) by burnt-offerings (offered in the domestic fire), as well as their offspring, their cattle, the sacred learning (of their families), therefore, indeed, (a woman) should not refuse (alms) to the crowd of students; for amongst those (who come to beg), there might be one of that (devout) kind, one who thus (conscientiously) keeps his vow.


[^9]:  Regarding the explanation of the term Abhiśasta, see below, I, 7, 21, 17. Haradatta: 'Apapātras are called those born from a high-caste mother and a low-caste father, such as washermen. For their cooking vessels &c. are unfit for the use of the four castes. . . . Since Āpastamba says, In the evening and in the morning, food obtained in the evening must not be used for the morning meal, nor food obtained in the morning for the evening meal."' Manu II, 182, 183, 185; Āśv. Gṛ. Sū. I, 22, 4. See also Gopatha-brāhmaṇa I, 2, 6.
