The Dvādaśāha is the Prakṛti of the Ahargaṇas.

## Commentary

The Dvādaśāha lasts twelve days and is a Soma sacrifice. It is either an Ahīna or a Sattra. An Ahargaṇa is a series of daily and nightly sacrifices. Those which last from two nights to eleven nights are called Ahīna. Those which last from thirteen to one hundred nights or more are called Sattras.
