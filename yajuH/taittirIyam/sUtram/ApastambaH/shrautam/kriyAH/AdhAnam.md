## परिचयः
- In pUrNAdhAna the entire aupAsanAgni is used for brahmAudana, and thence aupasana agni is not maintained.
  - pUrNAdhAna is rarely done now a days, as after pUrNAdhAna, it's not clear from shastras, as to how one should perform samskaras like siimantonayana etc, shraddhas, if there is no aupasana agni.+++(5)+++
- In ardhAdhAna, only part of aupAsanAgni is used for brahmAudana, the rest is maintained as aupasana dhAryAgni.
- Those who do pUrNAdhAna do not  continue with aupasana, whereas those who do ardhAdhAna continue with agnihotra and aupasana.
