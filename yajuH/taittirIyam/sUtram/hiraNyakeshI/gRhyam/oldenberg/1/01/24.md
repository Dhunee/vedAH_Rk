24. [^15]  Having consecrated the Prokṣaṇī water by means of the purifiers as before, having placed the vessels upright, and having untied the fuel, he sprinkles (the sacrificial vessels) three times with the whole (Prokṣaṇī water).


[^15]:  Regarding the Prokṣaṇī water, see Śāṅkhāyana I, 8, 25 note. The word which I have translated by 'vessels' is bilavanti, which literally means 'the things which have brims.' Probably this expression here has some technical connotation unknown to me. Mātṛdatta simply says, bilavanti pātrāṇi.'As before' means, 'as stated with regard to the Praṇīta water.'
