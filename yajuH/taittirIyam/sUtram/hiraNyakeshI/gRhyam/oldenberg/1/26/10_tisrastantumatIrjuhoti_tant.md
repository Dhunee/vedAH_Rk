10. [^3]  Having made oblations with the single Vyāhṛtis and with (the three Vyāhṛtis together), and having made an oblation with the verse, 'Thou art quick, Agni, and free from imprecation. Verily (satyam) thou art quick. Held by us in our quick mind (manas), with thy quick (mind) thou carriest the offering (to the gods). Being quick bestow medicine on us! Svāhā!' - this (last) oblation contains an allusion to the mind (manas), it refers to Prajāpati, and alludes to the number seven (?), - he quickly repeats in his mind the daśahotṛ formula (Taitt. Āraṇy. III, 1, 1). Then he makes the sagraha oblation (?); (then follow the oblations), 'This, O Varuṇa' (&c.; see I, 2, 8, 16, down to the end of the Sūtra). Then he serves food to the Brāhmaṇas and causes them to say, 'An auspicious day! Hail! Good luck!' he then performs in the known way the sacrifice of a mess of cooked food to Agni.


[^3]:  As to the Mantra, 'Thou art quick, &c.,' comp. above, I, 1, 3, 5, and the note on Śāṅkhāyana I, 9, 12. I cannot see why the oblation made with this Mantra is called saptavatī (alluding to the number seven); possibly we ought to read satyavatī (containing the word satyam, 'verily'). Can the words sagrahaṃ hutvā mean, 'having performed the worship of the planets (graha) at his sacrifice'?
