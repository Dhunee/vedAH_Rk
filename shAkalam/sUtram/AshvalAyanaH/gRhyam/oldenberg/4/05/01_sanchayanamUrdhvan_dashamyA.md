1 [^1] . The gathering (of the bones is performed) after the tenth (Tithi from the death), (on a Tithi) with an odd number, of the dark fortnight, under a single Nakṣatra.


[^1]:  5, 1. Nārāyaṇa (comp. the Āśvalāyana-Gṛhya-Pariśiṣṭa III, 7) understands this Sūtra in a different way. 'After the tenth Tithi of the dark fortnight, on a Tithi with an odd number, is e. on the eleventh, thirteenth, or fifteenth.' The single Nakṣatras are those the name of which does not denote two Nakṣatras (as, for instance, the two Aṣāḍhās). Comp. Kāty.-Śraut. XXV, 8, 1; Manu V, 59.
