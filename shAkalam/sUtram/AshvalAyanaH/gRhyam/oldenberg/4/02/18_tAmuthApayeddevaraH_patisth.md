18 [^7] . Her brother-in-law, being a representative of her husband, or a pupil (of her husband), or an aged servant, should cause her to rise (from that place) with (the verse), 'Arise, O wife, to the world of life' (Rig-veda X, 18, 8).


[^7]:  Possibly the words devaraḥ and patisthānīyaḥ refer to two different persons, so that we should have to translate, 'Her brother-in-law, (or some other) representative of her husband, &c.'
