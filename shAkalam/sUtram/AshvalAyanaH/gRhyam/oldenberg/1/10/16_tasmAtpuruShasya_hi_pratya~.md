16 [^7] . 'Therefore of a man who is sitting with his face to the west the southern (i.e. right) eye is northern, the northern (i.e. left) eye is southern.'


[^7]:  It is doubtful whether this paragraph should be considered as forming part of the quotation from the Śruti. The object of this passage is, in my opinion, to explain why the southern Ājyabhāga belongs to Soma, who is the presiding deity of the north, and the northern Ājyabhāga to Agni, the presiding deity of the south-east. Professor Stenzler's opinion about this paragraph is somewhat different.
