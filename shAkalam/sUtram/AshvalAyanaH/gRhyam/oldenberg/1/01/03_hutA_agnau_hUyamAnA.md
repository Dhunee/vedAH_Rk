the hutas, (i.e. the sacrifices) offered over the fire; over something that is not the fire, the prahutas; and at the feeding of Brāhmaṇas, those offered in the Brahman. [^2]


[^2]:  Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 5, 1; I, 10, 7. The division here is somewhat different from that given by Śāṅkhāyana; what Śāṅkhāyana calls ahuta, is here prahuta ('sacrificed up'); the prahutas of Śāṅkhāyana form here no special category; the prāśitas of Śāṅkhāyana are the brahmaṇi hutās of Āśvalāyana. Thus Āśvalāyana has three categories, while Śāṅkhāyana (and quite in the same way Pāraskara I, 4, 1) gives four. Nārāyaṇa mentions as an example of prahuta sacrifices the baliharaṇa prescribed below, I, 2, 3.
