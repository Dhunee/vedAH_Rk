4 [^2] . Or all who officiate at the Ahīna sacrifices and at those lasting one day.


[^2]:  The Ahīna sacrifices are those which last more than one day, but not more than twelve days. (Indische Studien, IX, 373; X, 355.) The priests officiating at such sacrifices are the sixteen stated in the Śrauta-sūtra IV, 1, 6. 7. Those besides the sixteen, though they are chosen (saty api varaṇe) for taking part in the sacred performances, have not the rank of ṛtvijas (officiating priests); such are the Sadasya, the Samitṛ, and the Camasādhvaryavaḥ (schol. Śrautas. loc. cit.). See Max Müller's History of A. S. L., pp. 450, 469 seq. As to the Sadasya, however, there was some difference of opinion (see the next Sūtra).
