1 [^1] . The Upaniṣad (treats of) the Garbhalambhana, the Puṃsavana, and the Anavalobhana (i.e. the ceremonies for securing the conception of a child, the male gender of the child, and for preventing disturbances which could endanger the embryo).


[^1]:  13, 1. Nārāyaṇa evidently did not know the Upaniṣad here referred to; he states that it belongs to another Śākhā. Comp. Professor Max Müller's note on Bṛhad Āraṇyaka VI, 4, 24 (S.B.E., vol. xv, p. 222).
