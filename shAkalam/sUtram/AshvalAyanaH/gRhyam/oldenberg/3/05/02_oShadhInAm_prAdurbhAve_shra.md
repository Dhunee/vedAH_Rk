2 [^1] . When the herbs appear, (when the moon stands in conjunction) with Śravaṇa, in the Śrāvaṇa month,


[^1]:  5, 2, 3. Perhaps the division of these Sūtras should be altered, so that śrāvaṇasya would belong to Sūtra 2. In this case we should have to translate, '2. When the herbs appear, (on a day on which the moon stands in conjunction) with Śravaṇa. 3. Or on the fifth (Tithi) of the Śrāvaṇa month, under (the Nakṣatra) Hasta.' Comp. śrāvaṇasya pañcamīm, Par. II, 10, 2. If we count the month beginning with the bright fortnight, and assume that the full moon day of Śrāvaṇa falls, as the name of the month implies, on Śravaṇa, the fifth Tithi of that month will fall indeed on Hasta. Comp. on the dates of the Upākaraṇa, Prof. Weber's remarks, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra II, 322, and on the special symbolical signification of the Nakṣatra Śravaṇa in this connection, my note on Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 2.
