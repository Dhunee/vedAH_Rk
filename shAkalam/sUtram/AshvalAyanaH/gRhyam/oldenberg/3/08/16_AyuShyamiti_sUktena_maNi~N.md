[^4]:  On the hymn beginning with the words 'Giving life,' see Prof. Stenzler's note on this Sūtra. Its first verse is identical with Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā XXXIV, 50 (comp. also Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya III, 1, 7), and so are most of its verses found in that Saṃhitā or in the Atharva-veda; the whole of it occurs among the Rig-veda Khilas (vol. vi, p. 25, 2-12).
