There are more circumstantial points that all add up. 

- First, the RV does not mention iShTaka which is abundantly mention in later vedic tradition with Iranic parallels (iShTya). Irrespective of whether the Arya-s acquired this word from an earlier PIE word, BMAC/Namazga or IVC, it implies that the RV must predate the wide use of bricks in construction or ritual. This is despite the mention of stone fortifications. 
- Further even though pUr are mentioned there is no city name in RV. In contrast later brAhmaNa texts record town(settlement) names as in most old cultures. Wide space, gold, cattle, horses are sought but little of the products or the town. This indicates composition in place where specific settlements mattered little. 
- In contrast late yajurveda indicates a variegated society with Harappan professions like the beadmaker, various artisans & glass. These are not mentioned in RV. There are some more points that I'd summarize whenever I get to writing an updated article on this. 
- Other mentioned by Tilak like the long dawns. 

- Thus, when we put it all together, it makes sense that original RV was not composed in the late/post-Harappan Punjab but the steppes.
