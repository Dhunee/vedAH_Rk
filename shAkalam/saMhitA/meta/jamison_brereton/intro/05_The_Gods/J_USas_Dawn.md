title = "J UṢas “Dawn”"

+++
Dawn is one of the few female divinities in the R̥gveda and the most prominent  among them. Twenty-one hymns are dedicated to her alone (every maṇḍala but  II, VIII, and of course IX containing at least one), many of them displaying high  poetic artistry and beauty of imagery, and she is mentioned hundreds of times in the text. She also has an Indo-European pedigree, being cognate with the Greek  goddess Eos and the Latin goddess Aurora. 

The femininity of Dawn is one of her defining characteristics. She is generally  depicted as a beautiful young woman, flirtatious and scantily dressed. Since she  embodies the first light of day, she is gleaming and covered with bright ornaments,  and her appearance thus strongly contrasts with that of her dark sister Night, a  much less prominent goddess, though the ceaseless alternation of Dawn and Night  is often remarked on. Her dispelling of the darkness and of fears of night is much  appreciated, as she awakens and rouses everyone to their daily activities. Dawn is  also, not surprisingly, associated with the god Sun, Sūrya, who is often depicted as  following her as her suitor or husband. She is also said to be the mother or possessor  of cows—the cows being the milky sky and rays of light at early dawn (see Watkins  1987 and 2009 for the Indo-European trope of “the milk of the dawn cows”). +++(4)+++

Her associations are not all positive, however. Because she heralds every new day,  she reminds men of the unstoppable passage of time and of the aging process, as  well as of the generations of men who used to view the dawn but have passed away.  Dawn’s daily rebirth as an ever-young beauty presents a cruel contrast to the human  condition of change and decay+++(4)+++. The poets also often reflect on the paradox that each  Dawn is new but each is the same as the one before and the one that will come after. 

## Culturally specific associations
The characteristics of Dawn mentioned above are reflections of the universal  nature of dawn, but she also displays culturally specific qualities relating to Vedic  ritual. 

Dawn ushers in the sacrificial day, especially the kindling of the ritual fire pre paratory to the early-morning rites, and the interplay between the natural sources  of light—dawn and the sun—and the man-made one—fire—is often described as  complex and co-determined. 

Moreover, Dawn is regularly associated with wealth  and its distribution to the sacrificial participants and is urged to give generously to  them. This association between wealth and dawn has no naturalistic source, but  arises from the fact that in R̥gvedic ritual the dakṣiṇās or “priestly gifts” were distributed to the priests and poets at the early-morning rites (rather than at midday,  as in classical śrauta ritual). 

## Myth
Despite the vividness of her depiction, Dawn participates very little in narrative  mythology, though there is a briefly alluded to (primarily IV.30.8–11) and extremely  enigmatic tale in which Indra smashes the cart of “evilly angry” Dawn, and she  runs away. Why Indra should turn against this emblem of benevolent femininity  is unclear, but the story is also associated with Indra’s stealing the wheel off the  Sun’s chariot, and both may have to do with the perturbation of regular temporal  sequences.
