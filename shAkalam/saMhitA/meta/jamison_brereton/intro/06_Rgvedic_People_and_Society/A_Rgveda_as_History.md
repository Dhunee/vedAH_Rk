title = "A R̥gveda as History"

+++
A number of scholars have treated the question of the historical background of the  R̥gveda and to what extent we can extract historical information from the names  of kings and peoples, the events they are depicted as participating in, and the place54 The Rigveda names where these events are depicted as occurring or where the kings and their  retinues are depicted as living. We do not intend to enter into these issues and will  simply make global reference to the many works of Michael Witzel (e.g., Witzel  1995a, 1995b), who has been especially active in discussing these questions in recent  decades. 

We will only note here that the R̥gveda contains a large number of certain or  likely personal names (see Mayrhofer 2003). Besides the poets and their ancestors,  many of the names belong to royal patrons and are therefore especially common  in dānastutis. 

Some kings have a presence outside of dānastutis, however; particularly noteworthy are the Tr̥tsu or Bharata King Sudās (“Good Giver”), the victor  in the famous Battle of the Ten Kings treated in VII.18, whose forces also crossed  a formidable barrier of rivers, as depicted in the dialogue hymn III.33, and King  Trasadasyu, whose Royal Consecration may form the subject of the dialogue hymn  IV.42. 

Others belong to human enemies of the poet and his group, whose defeat the  gods (generally Indra) aid our side in effecting, or to clients of various gods, especially the Aśvins, who receive help from these divine patrons. Needless to say, the  “reality” of those named, especially in the last two groups, cannot be ascertained.
