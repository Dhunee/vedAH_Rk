Talking of academic plagiarism -- it is rampant in  academic circles, often perpetrated by powerful labs, especially in magazines & high stakes journals but nobody bothers as he powerful can do what they want. Coming to the American strain of white indology 1 could say that the recent translation of the R^igveda into English by 2 American indologists is in a sense a plagiarism because it is in large part a translation of the German translation of the RV by Karl Friedrich Geldner. Evidence for this comes from the fact that they repeat Geldner's mistakes/misunderstandings. Geldner, himself was a pioneering scholar but there is more to the RV than accepting his translation as final.
