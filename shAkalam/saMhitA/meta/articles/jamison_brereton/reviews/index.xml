      <description>Talking of academic plagiarism &amp;ndash; it is rampant in academic circles, often perpetrated by powerful labs, especially in magazines &amp;amp; high stakes journals but nobody bothers as he powerful can do what they want. Coming to the American strain of white indology 1 could say that the recent translation of the R^igveda into English by 2 American indologists is in a sense a plagiarism because it is in large part a translation of the German translation of the RV by Karl Friedrich Geldner.</description>
