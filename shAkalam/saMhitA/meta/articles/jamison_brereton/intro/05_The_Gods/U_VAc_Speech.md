title = "U VĀc “Speech”"

+++
One last goddess should be mentioned, Vāc or deified Speech (a noun with feminine  gender). Although this goddess figures in a number of mythological narratives in  the middle Vedic period, and although she ultimately seems to have become conflated with Sarasvatī, thus amplifying the status of both goddesses, in the R̥gveda  she appears as a clear personage very rarely, most prominently in a late hymn  (X.125), which is a 1st-person self-praise (ātmastuti) spoken by Vāc herself.
