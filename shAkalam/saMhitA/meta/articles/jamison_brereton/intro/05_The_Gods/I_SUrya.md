+++
If the Milky Way is the celestial embodiment of Savitar, Sūrya, the Sun, comes  close to being that of Mitra and Varuṇa. The Sun is their eye, for his gaze is wide  (VII.35.8) and falls on everyone (I.50.2). The Sun watches over the good and evil  deeds of humans (VI.51.2, VII.60.2–3) and, so the poet hopes, declares the innocence of the sacrificers to Mitra and Varuṇa (VII.60.1, 62.2). The Sun is the felly  that rolls toward Mitra and Varuṇa (V.62.2) or the chariot that the two gods set  in heaven (V.63.7). Since he is so closely linked to the Ādityas, he himself is called  an Āditya (I.50.13, 191.9; VIII.101.11). His link to the Ādityas is also a link to the  king, who oversees his subjects the way that the Sun oversees all beings (X.121 and  Proferes 2007: 137–41). 

However, Sūrya is not associated exclusively with the Ādityas. He is a form of  Agni, Agni Vaiśvānara, and the face of Agni.+++(4)+++ 

Not only the Ādityas (IV.13.2) or  Mitra and Varuṇa (V.63.4), but also Varuṇa and Indra (VII.82.3), Agni (X.3.2),  Soma (VI.44.23, IX.86.22), and Indra and Viṣṇu (VII.99.4) are said to have given  birth to the Sun, to have caused him rise to heaven, or to have established his  brilliance. 

A number of images depict the movement of the sun through the heavens. The  Sun flies through the air on a chariot pulled by seven horses or seven mares (I.50.8,  9, IV.13.3, V.45.9), or the Sun is a wheel pulled by only one horse, Etaśa (VII.63.2).  The Sun is also the “reddish eagle” (V.77.3) or a falcon (V.45.9), or he flies like a falcon (VII.63.5). 

## Myth
However, there are relatively few narratives concerning the Sun. One  repeated but mysterious story is that Indra stole or tore off the wheel of the Sun.  He did so in order to help his ally Kutsa in Kutsa’s battle against Śuṣṇa (I.130.9,  175.4, IV.30.4, V.29.10). What exactly Indra accomplished by doing this and how  this helped Kutsa remain unclear.
