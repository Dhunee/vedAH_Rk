title = "G Aditi and the ādityas"

+++
As a group, the Ādityas generally represent the powers that order human society.+++(5)+++  This function is most evident in the three principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman. In addition to these three, however, there are minor deities who are also  called Ādityas—Dakṣa, Bhaga, and Aṃśa—and a number of other gods, such as  Savitar and Sūrya, who may be called Ādityas when they exercise functions like  those of the major Ādityas. 

## Aditi
The Ādityas are sons of the goddess Aditi, whose name means “offenselessness”  or “innocence.” She embodies obedience to the principles of right social behavior  that her sons represent. Later, the motherhood of Aditi becomes central to her  identity and she becomes a mother to other deities. 

## Varuṇa
The most prominent of the Ādityas is Varuṇa, whose name is related to vratá “commandment” and who therefore is the god of commandments. While all the  major Ādityas are kings, Varuṇa in particular represents the authority of the king.  In IV.42, as in the later Rājasūya, the king becomes both Varuṇa and Indra; that is,  as Varuṇa, the king is a judicial authority governing the actions of his subjects, and  as Indra, he is a leader in war.+++(5)+++ Accordingly, the divine acts of Varuṇa were often  reflected in the functions of the R̥gvedic king. 

- Like the king, Varuṇa watches over  his subjects by means of his spáśaḥ “spies” (e.g., I.25.13). 
- One of the responsibilities of the king was to ensure the prosperity of his subjects by providing sufficient  water for animals and crops. Therefore, the divine king Varuṇa brings rain (V.85.3– 4) and controls the waters, causing them to flow according to his commandment  (II.28.4).
- As the king orders the human world, so Varuṇa orders both the human  world and the world at large: the moon and stars appear and disappear according  to his commandment (I.24.10), and he makes a place and a path for the sun in the  sky (I.24.8, V.85.2, VII.87.1, 5). 
- The king maintained the social order by punishing  wrong-doers, and, likewise, poets fear Varuṇa’s anger and his fetters (pā́śāḥ), with  which he binds those who violate his commandments (e.g., I.24.15, 25.21). 
- Varuṇa  is the master of the truth that governs the actions of things, as the king must be as  well (II.28.6). 

Given that his kingship complements Indra’s, we might have expected  Varuṇa to have had a greater presence in the R̥gveda than he does. However, the  R̥gveda emerged primarily from the soma rite, and the soma rite belongs to Indra.  In the R̥gvedic period there probably were other rites dedicated to Varuṇa or to  Varuṇa and other Ādityas—there is such a rite in the classical tradition—but these  left little trace in the R̥gveda. 

## Mitra
In most hymns Varuṇa is closely connected to Mitra, with whom he shares most  of his royal functions. Unlike váruṇa, the meaning of mitrá is reasonably certain.  A mitrá was an ally or an alliance, and Mitra is the god of alliances. While Varuṇa44 The Rigveda 
governs relations in which one person has authority over another, Mitra governs  relations defined by mutual obligations.+++(5)+++ These two kinds of relationships overlap  with one another, so it is not surprising that the functions of Mitra and Varuṇa  likewise often coincide and that the two gods are so often paired. Only one hymn,  III.59, is dedicated to Mitra alone. As the god of alliances, Mitra governs peace  agreements between different people, ensuring that they will take their proper  places (III.59.1, 5; cf. VII.36.2) and remain in them (III.59.6). 

When other gods  have functions similar to Mitra’s, they may be identified with him. In particular,  Agni is sometimes called Mitra (e.g., III.5.4) or creates a mitrá, an alliance, when he  appears at dawn. The alliance to which such passages refer is the sacrificial alliance  between gods and mortals. Humans offer the truth in their hymns and offer soma,  milk, ghee, and the like as their oblations. In this way, they empower the gods, and  the gods in turn provide what is necessary for human life. 

## Aryaman
The last of the major Ādityas is Aryaman, the god of the customs of the Āryas.  He therefore represents a third social principle, the customary rules that govern  relations among Vedic tribes and peoples.+++(5)+++ This principle was especially essential in  a society where the authority of the ruler would not have penetrated deeply into  the daily lives or the households of his people. Among the spheres in which custom  determined behavior was marriage, which created a new social bond between unrelated families. Since marriage depended on the recognition of custom, marriage  fell within Aryaman’s governance. 

While we have presented Aryaman as the god  of customs, Thieme (1938, 1957) and other scholars following him have preferred  to see Aryaman more narrowly as the god governing the rules of hospitality. In the  absence of a state, the Vedic peoples needed to expect Ārya strangers to recognize  and to act according to the customary norms of hospitality. Such norms were critical in creating the possibility of relations among Āryas and therefore in unifying  them. Aryaman does not often appear apart from Varuṇa and Mitra and shares  their broader roles in maintaining the natural as well as the social world. 

## Other Ādityas
Although relatively minor presences, three other gods, Bhaga, the god of for tune, Aṃśa, the god of the share, and Dakṣa, the god of (priestly) skill, are also  called Ādityas. 

Bhaga ensures that people will receive an appropriate portion of  the goods of life. He is often linked with Aryaman and with the expectation for the  prosperity of a marriage.
 
 Aṃśa ensures that people will receive the share of goods  owed them, and therefore he is concerned with inheritance. In both cases, the two  gods bring goods to people according to their behavior and family identity, and  that function brings them within the sphere of social principles represented by the  major Ādityas. 
 
 Like the major Ādityas, Dakṣa is also concerned with right behavior,  but in his case, it is the skilled actions of sacrificers. For further on the Ādityas, see  Brereton (1981).
