      <description>The R̥gveda was composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit that is richer in forms and less grammatically fixed than Classical Sanskrit, but essentially identical in structure. For further discussion of the language, see section VII below. The text was composed entirely orally and transmitted entirely orally for a very long time, probably several millennia. But it was a type of oral composition very different from what that designation now generally brings to mind in scholarly, especially Homeric, circles.</description>

      <description>The structure of the R̥gveda points to several stages in the creation of the R̥gvedic text as we now have it. Collections of hymns were first made by the families of poets who produced them, and these early collections defined the various poetic tradi tions and helped train new poets within those traditions. At some point a unified consolidation was made of six family traditions, which formed the original collec tion of the Family Books, II–VII.</description>

      <description>With regard to indigenous commentary, the situation of the R̥gveda differs markedly from that of standard Classical Sanskrit texts, in that there is no unbroken commentarial tradition that might preserve the understanding of the text by the authors and audience at the time of composition. Although we find implicit commentary on some parts of the R̥gveda already in later Vedic texts, it is clear that in many case this “commentary” is based more on adaptation, speculation, or fancy than on a direct transmission of the purport of the text, as when the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (XI.</description>

      <description>Because the transmission of the R̥gveda has preserved the text remarkably well, we have a trustworthy and uniform text of the R̥gveda. The published editions of the R̥gveda differ in their presentation of the text, not in the text itself. The landmark edition of the R̥gveda was that of Max Müller (1849–74), who published both the Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha text in devanāgarī script, together with Sāyaṇa’s commentary. Before the completion of Müller’s R̥gveda, in 1861–63 Theodor Aufrecht published the text in Roman transliteration, together with selected Padapāṭha analyses.</description>
