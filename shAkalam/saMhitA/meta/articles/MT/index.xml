Sneha, snowstorms, the sun and the moon in enigmatic ṛk-s
Motivation That the Indo-European homeland was a cold place with snow is evidenced by widespread survival of two hon-homologous words for snow. Recently, a discussion on one of these words, sparked by some linguist, landed on my timeline on Twitter. From that, it seemed that people were unaware of the attestation of its cognate in Old Indo-Aryan. This, in turn, reminded me of a discussion we had with our friend in college on the very same issue.</description>

The remoteness of the era of the veda, those oldest words of our Aryan ancestors, are hardly grasped without deep consideration. This indeed is a testimony of the great age of the veda, so hoary that its usages remained mysterious to most brahmins of the ages and upstart indologists of the modern era. Even the learned sAyaNa of the mideaval Andhra country remained clueless on some such matters. So when one grasps an obscure mantra of the R^igveda the feeling is profound.</description>

There are a set of remarkable hymns in the R^igveda at least one of which ought to be learnt by any fire worshipping denizen of bhArata but sadly even their name is unknown to many modern day brAhmaNas. What are these hymns ? They are the AprI suktAni or the familial hymns for consecrating the sacrificial site that remarkable in terms of their structure and the devas they mention.</description>

      <description>Arya, the famous frog hymn of RV mentions Atiratra Soma Yaga, do you think it could be same as the one which involves piling of Altar as preserved by Nambuthiris?
That&amp;rsquo;s correct it mentions atitrAtra &amp;amp; there is little doubt that it is the same soma ritual being mentioned. Now the question is whether that implies that all other aspects of the somayAga as a whole were the same in the RV period.</description>

      <description>Short story: White indologists swear by Oldenburg. I remain unconvinced by the counts reflecting age of the family books.
What we do know is that vishvAmitra-s, vasiShTha-s and jamadagni-s refer to each other or share mantra-s suggesting they were contemporaneous. Thus RV3, RV7 &amp;amp; jamadagni mantra-s in RV9, 10 are likely contemporaneous. - MT_TW. atri-s, certain kAshyapa-s and certain kANva-s refer to each other they were likely contemporaneous. The RV9 is collection of soma sUkta-s from many families so it is obviously of composite age.</description>

      <description>Preposition frequency frequencies of common preposition-like prefixes in the RV:
pra 986 vi 948 abhi 634 sam 608 pari 500 ni 483 anu 436 upa 394 adhi 272 prati 245 apa 167 ava 165 ati 143 antar 97 punar 87 saha 61 dhI vishvAmitra famously uses the word &amp;lsquo;dhi&amp;rsquo; in his mantra used by Arya-s in their saMdhyopAsana. Interestingly, it occurs at highest normalized frequency in his maNDala
RV_1 0.030 RV_2 0.</description>

      <description>@blog_supplement &amp;rsquo;s two most solid reasons for early bronze age RV composition outside the subcontinent:
Astronomical - memory of precession of the equinox - https://t.co/j0NmPUhYPj
Linguistic - hypometrical verses https://t.co/PGryb2JzQd https://t.co/SUnxoKk9q2
What makes these reasons so compelling are the simplicity of the arguments. There is no obfuscation with jargon or appeal to authority in these - Just as the simplicity of the genetic evidence is compelling evidence for Aryan entry and its dating into the subcontinent.</description>

      <description>How late do you think is the पुरुष सूक्त?
This question can be answered thus: the theology/framework presented in it is early-Indo-European having cognates in the Germanic world and Iranic (inferred via lateral transfer to Chinese).
As a sUkta, the 1st 15 R^ik-s form an earlier stratum, with the 16th added later. The 1st 15 themselves might have had an archaic core that was related to the human sacrifice which was already becoming otiose by the time of the earliest vaidika rituals that have come down to us.</description>

Revised: Numbers in the RV. Note that they are mostly &amp;ldquo;Benfordian&amp;rdquo; except for 3 and 7. These were clearly over-represented by ~3-5 times suggesting that they had a special significance. A whole sUkta to the ashvin-s 1.34 of hiraNyastUpa is one of triads.
3 3 comes in several key compounds such as tridhAtu: It means 3 divisions or parts. This term was perhaps ancestral to the later trihumoral theory of traditional medicine given a mantra to the ashvin-s:</description>
