## English translation:

“Relax (the bonds) imosed by all the ill deeds of our fore-fathers, and those incurred (by the sins) whichwe have committed in our person ns; liberate, royal **Varuṇa**, like a calf from its tether, **Vasiṣṭha** like a thiefnourishing the animal (he has stolen).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a calf: there are two comparisons: liberate Vasiṣṭha (i.e., me) like asa thief (is liberated), who (having performed his penance for the theft he has committed, at its termination) feedsthe animals (with food), and (i.e., or) like a calf from its tether: paśutṛpam na tāyum stainyaprāyaścittamkṛtvāvasāne ghāsādibhiḥ paśūnām tarpayitāram **stena** iva damno rajjoḥ vatsam na vatsam iva cavasiṣṭham mām bandhakāt pāpāt avasṛja vimuñca
