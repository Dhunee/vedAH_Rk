## English translation:

“**Agni**, kindled (into flame), come to our presence in the same chariot with **Indra**, and with the swiftmoving gods; may **Aditi**, the mother of excellent sons, sit down on the sacred grass, and may the immortal godsbe satisfied with the reverentially-offered oblation.”
