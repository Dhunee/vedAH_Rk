## English translation:

“Glorified be the divine **Savitā**, whom all the gods praise; may that adorable (diviniy) require our praises(with) food; may he always protect the devout with all his protections.”

Whom all the gods praise: yam viśvevasavo grṇanti, whom all the **Vasus** praise; here **vasavaḥ** = **devāḥ**
