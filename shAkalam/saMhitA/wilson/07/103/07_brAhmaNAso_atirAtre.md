## English translation:

“Like **Brāhmaṇas** at the **Soma** libation, at the **Atirātra** sacrifice, you are now croaking around thereplenished lake (throughout the night), for on that day of the year you frogs are everywhere about, when it is theday of the serving of the rains.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Croaking: rātrau śabdam kurvāṇaḥ; the atirātra rite is a noctural ceremony,when the priests recite the hymns at night; rātrim atītya vartate ityatirātraḥ yathātirātrākhye somayāgebrāhmaṇā rātrau stutaśāstrāṇi paryāyeṇa śaṃsanti
