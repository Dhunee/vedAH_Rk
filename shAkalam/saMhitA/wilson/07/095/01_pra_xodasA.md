## English translation:

“This **Sarasvatī**, firm as a city made of metal, flows rapidly with all sustaining water, sweeping away inits might all other waters, as a charioteer (clears the road).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Firm as a city: dharuṇam āyasi pūḥ = ayasanirmita purīva;

Dharuṇam = dharuṇa, dhārayitrī, supporter
