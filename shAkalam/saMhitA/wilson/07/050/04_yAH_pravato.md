## English translation:

“May the divine rivers, whether flowing down declivities, in hollow plural ces, or upwards, whether filled withwater or dry, nourishing all with their water, be auspicious to us communicating not disease; may all the rivers beunproductive of harm.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Communicating not disease: aśipadā bhavantu: name of a malady; may they beunproductive of the śipada complaint; unproductive of harm: aśimidā bhavantu: śimi = **vadha**, killing; ahiṃsaprada, not doing harm or injury
