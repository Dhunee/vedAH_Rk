## English translation:

“May the brilliant **Agni** counteract that poison which is genitive rated in the manifold knots (of trees) and thelike, or which is smeared upon the knees of ankles; let not the tortuous snake recognize me by the sound of myfootsteps.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Knots of trees: yad vijāman paruṣi vandanam = vandanam etat sanjñakam viṣam: **vandana** is apoison so named; yad **vividha** janmani vṛkṣādīnām **parvaṇi** udbhavet, which may originate in thevariously-born joints of trees and others; Smeared upon knees: aṣṭhīvantau parikulphau ca dehat: paridehat =upacitam kuryāt, let him smear
