## English translation:

“The food-bestowing sacred grass of these (the worshippers) is strewn; may the two lords of people,**Vāyu** with the **Niyut** steeds, and **Pūṣan**, invoked before the dawn upon the close of the night, appear now inthe firmament for the welfare of mankind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The two lords of people: viśpaīve vīrite iyāte antarikṣeāgacchatām: iva = idanīm, now; it may also connote a comparison, comparing Vāyu and Pūṣan to tworājās appearing among a crowd of attendants, yathā manuṣayāṇām gaṇe rājānau; cf. **Yaska** **Nirukta**.5.28; upon the close of the night: aktor uṣasaḥ pūrvahūtau = rātreḥ saṃbandhinyā uṣasaḥ sakāśātpūrvasmin āhvāne sate, there being the invocation preceding the proximity of the dawn in connection with thenight. Another interpretation: Pūṣan as the sun, appears after the prior invocation of the dawn upon the lightingof the sacrificial fire; Vāyu connotes **Agni**, of whom he is the friend; and who is the divinity of the nocturnalsacrifice
