## English translation:

“When (I, **Vasiṣṭha**) and **Varuṇa** ascend the ship together when we send it forth into the midst of theocean, when we proceed over the waters with swift (sailing vessels), then may we both undulate happily in theprosperous swing.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With swift sailing vessels: snubhis' carāva gantrībhir naubhiḥ: with going, viz., ships; thenmay we both undulate: pra preṅkha īṅkhayāvahai śubhe kam: preṅkhe naurūpāyām dolāyām evapreṅkhayāvahai nimnonnatais taraṅgair itas' cetaśca pravicalantau saṅkrīḍāvahai, let us both sport, beingtossed here and there by the up and down waves, as it were in a swing, in the form of a ship
