## English translation:

“I propitiate with oblations the ramifications of that divine attainable **Viṣṇu**, the showerer of benefits;**Rudra**, bestow upon us the magnificence of his nature; the **Aśvins** have come to our dwelling abond with(sacrificial) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ramifications: **vayāḥ**, branches; all other deities, as it were, branches of Viṣṇu: anye devāhśākhā iva **bhavanti**; citing a text: viṣṇu is all divinities, **viṣṇuḥ** **sarā** **devatā** iti śruteḥ: viṣnuḥ sarvādevatāḥ (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.1)
