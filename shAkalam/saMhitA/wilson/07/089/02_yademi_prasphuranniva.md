## English translation:

“When, **Varuṇa**, I am throbbing as if (with awe) like an inflated skin, grant me happiness, possessor ofwealth, grant me happiness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When I am throbbinga: (an epithet added): adrivas = armed with stones for slinging;the allusion seems to be to varuṇa **pāśa**, a kind of dropsy; cf. **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** vii.15
