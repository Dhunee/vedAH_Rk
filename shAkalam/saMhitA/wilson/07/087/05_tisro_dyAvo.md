## English translation:

“In him are deposited the three heavens, the three earths with their six seasons are shown in him; themost adorable, royal **Varuṇa** has made this golden sun undulating in the sky, he has made it to diffuse light.”

Thethree earths: best, middle most, worst; tisro bhūmīrdhārayan cf. RV. 2.027.08: trayo vā ime trivṛto lokāḥ(**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.17); he has made it to diffuse light: śubhe kam = dīptyartham;

Kam = sukham
