## English translation:

“You gave vigour, **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, to **Sudāsa** when surrounded on all sides by the ten **rājās** (inthe country) where the pious Tṛtsus, walking in whiteness, and wearing braided hair, worshipped with oblationsand praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Walking in whiteness: śvit yañcaḥ kapardinas tṛtsavaḥ: the epithes are explained: svaityamnairmālyam gacchantaḥ, going in, or to, whiteness, or freedom from soil; and **jaṭilaḥ**, having braided hair. TheTṛtsus are the pupils of **Vasiṣṭha**, Vasiṣṭhaśiṣyāḥ etasanjñāḥ ṛtvijāḥ
