## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Soma**, fall upon the destructive (**rākṣasa**) and the performer of unprofitable acts, so that,consumed (by your wrath), he may perish like the offering cast into the fire; retain implacable hatred to the haterof **brāhmaṇas**, the cannibal, the hideous, the vile (rākṣasa).”

Hideous: ghoracakṣase= rude in speech; vile rākṣasa: kimīdine = kimīdānīm iti carate, to one who goes saying, What now? Thatis, piśunāya, a spy, an informer; or cruel, vile
