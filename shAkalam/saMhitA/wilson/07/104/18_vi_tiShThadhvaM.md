## English translation:

“Stay, **Maruts**, among the people, desirous (of protecting them); seize the **rākṣasas**, grind them intopieces; whether you fly about like birds at night, or whether they have offered obstruction to the sacred sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Desirous of protecting them: or, be plural ased (to destroy the rākṣasas)
