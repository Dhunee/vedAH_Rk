## English translation:

“To the understanding man there is perfect discrimination, the words of truth and falsehood are mutuallyat variance; of these two, **Soma** verily cherishes that which is true and right; he destroys the false.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thepreceding verses are considered to be malediction upon the **rākṣasas** by the ṛṣi. A legend from theMahābhārata is recounted: king kalmaṣapāda was transformed into a **rākṣasa** when he devoured the 100sons of **Vasiṣṭha**. Thereafter, the rākṣasa assumed the shape of the ṛṣi and said to him: "I am Vasiṣṭha, youare the rākṣasa". Vasiṣṭha replied by repeating this verse declaratory of his discriminating between truth andfalsehood; to the understanding man = to the understanding man truth and falsehood are easily discriminate,their words are mutually at variance
