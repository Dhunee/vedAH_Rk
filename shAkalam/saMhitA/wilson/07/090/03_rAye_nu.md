## English translation:

“His own **Niyut** steeds bear to the plural ce of poverty the white- complexioned dispenser of wealth, **Vāyu**,whom heaven and earth bore for the sake of riches, whom the divine language of praise sustains as a deity forthe sake of riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nireke = dāridryam from nitarām riktatā; or, alternative interpretation: a plural ce crowdedwith people, bahujanākīrṇe sthāne; from nir = nirgata;

Reka = **śūnyatā**, emptiness
