## English translation:

“**Agni** has power to grant abundant food; he has power to grant riches with **male** posterity; vigorous Agni,let us not sit down before you devoid of sons, of beauty, of devotion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Devoid of beauty: māsavāḥ rūparahitaḥ: apsas = **rūpa** (apsa iti rūpa **nāma**: **Nirukta** 5.13)
