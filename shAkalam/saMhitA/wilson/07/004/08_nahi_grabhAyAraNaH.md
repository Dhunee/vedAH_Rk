“One not acquitting debts, although worthy of regard, yet begotten of another, is not to be contemplatedeven in the mind (as fit) for acceptance; for verily he returns to his own house; therefore let there come to us (ason) new- born, possessed of food, victorious over foes.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
