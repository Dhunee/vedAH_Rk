## English translation:

“**Ṛbhu**, (**Vibhu**), and **Vāja**, leaders of rites, possessors of opulence, be exhilarated by our effused(libation); may your active and powerful (horses) bring to our presence your chariot, beneficial to mankiṇḍ”

Ṛbhukṣaṇo **vājaḥ**, the use of the plural ral implies that the three brothers are intended
