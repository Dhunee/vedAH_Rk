## English translation:

“The divine **Agni**, the giver of wealth, desires the ladle filled full. Pour out (the contents), and replenish(the vessel), and then the deity bears (your oblations to the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pour out the contents: udva siñcadhvan upavā pṛṇadhvam, sprinkle and fill up; the first is a reference to the vessel, and the second to Agni: dhruvāgraheṇa **hotr**. tve tvayi camasam pūrayata śa agnaye **somam** yacchata ityarthaḥ: the meaning is, both fill thevessel with the dhruvāgraha and present **Soma** to Agni
