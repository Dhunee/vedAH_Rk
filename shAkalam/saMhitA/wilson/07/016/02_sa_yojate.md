## English translation:

“May he harness his brilliant protecting (steeds to his car), when earnestly invoked; may he hasten (tobring the gods); may the sacrificial wealth of the worshippers (proceed to) that deity who is the giver of abundantfood, the adorable, the doer of great deeds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vasunām devan rādho janānām = tam dhanānām madhyedevam atayantoparakṣamāṇam dhanam yajamānānām, may **Agni**, who harnesses, etc. be regardful of thebrilliant wealth of the worshippers;

Alternative: Agni goes quickly where the worship of the **Vasus**, **Rudras**,**Ādityas** is celebrated, and the sacrificial wealth of the worshippers is offered
