## English translation:

“**Indra**, the upholder of the three regions, whom the divine **Nirṛti** acknowledges as ruler, whom abundantyears pass over, whom mortals detain from his own abode, approaches to (recruit) his decaying strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Theupholder: upa tribandhu jaradaṣṭim eti: trayāṇām lokānām bandhaka;

Jaradaṣṭim = jīrṇam raśanamyasya balasya hetubhūtam tad balam upagacchati, he approaches that strength of which or of whose strength itis the cause;

Nirṛti = the earth
