## English translation:

“The pious man protected, **Maruts**, by you, is the possessor of hundreds; the assailant, overcomer (ofhis foes), protected by you, is the possessor of thousands; protected by you, the emperor slays his enemy; maythe wealth that is given, agitators, by you ever be abundant.”
