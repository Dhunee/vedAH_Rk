Waters that beat down the dust: nāmāni tiradhvam pāṃsūn namayanti nāmāni udakāni:nāmāni = waters, for they bend down the dust; multipled a thousand- fold: How can one portion become athousand? The quantity of an offering is computed, not by its actual number, but by that assigned to it by thedivinity to whom it is offered, yāvad ekā **devatā** kāmayate yāvadeka tāvad **āhutiḥ** prathate
