## English translation:

“Glorious is your vigour, unrelenting are your minds; (the exertion) of your irresistible force, the agitator(of the trees), is like (the manifold tone of the prayers of) a **muni**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Manifold tone: **dhuni** muniriva = the agitationlike a muni; the sounds produced by the shaking of the trees are like the varied intonations of a reciter ofpraises
