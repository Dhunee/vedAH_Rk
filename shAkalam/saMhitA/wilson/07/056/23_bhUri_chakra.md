## English translation:

“You have bestowed, **Maruts**, many (benefits) on our forefathers, which praiseworthy (benefits) havebeen celebrated in former times; by the (favour of the) Maruts the fierce (warrior) is victorious in combats; by the(favour of the) Maruts the worshipper ever obtains food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Marudbhir it sanitā vājam **arvā**: arvā = stotrairabhigantā, one who overcomes by praises; or, a horse; through the Maruts a horse is the obtainer (of success)in war
