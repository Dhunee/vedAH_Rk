## English translation:

“When heroic men, filled with wrath, assemble for (the sake of conquering) many plural nts and people;then, **Maruts**, sons of **Rudra**, be our defenders in battles against our enemies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many plural nts: bahviṣu oṣadhiṣuvikṣu = mahatīṣu oṣadhiṣu prajāsu jetavyāsu, in great plural nts and people to be subdued; by plural nta orvegetables, **oṣadhi**, the reference is, perhaps, to cultivated lands
