## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mostprominent in movement: aṅgirastamā = gantritamā, most going; may also be a reference to **aṅgirasas**, ofwhose race the **Bhāradvājas**, a branch, are said to be cognatewith the night: aṅgiro gotrair bhāradvājaihsaha ratrerutpattiḥ, hence night is elsewhere termed **bharadvāji**, rātrirvā **bhāradvāji** (**rātrī** kuśikahsaubharo rātrirvā **bhāradvājī**: RV. 10.127). aṅgirastamā, most **aṅgirasa**, is applied to the dawn becauseit is the same thing as the end of the night, rātryarasanasyo śarūpatvāt: may be, a reference to the specialseason of fire-worship instrumental tuted by **aṅgirasās**
