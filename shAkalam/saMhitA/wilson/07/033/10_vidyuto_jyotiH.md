## English translation:

“When **Mitra** and **Varuṇa** beheld you, **Vasiṣṭha**, quitting the lustre of the lightning (for a different form),then one of your births (took plural ce), inasmuch as **Agastya** bore you from your (former) abode.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agasya bore you:agastyo yat tvā viśā ājabhāra = yadā purvavasthānāt tvām ājahāra, when Agastya took you from theformer condition; mitrāvaruṇau āvām janayisyāva, we two Mitra and Varuṇa, will beget; or, āvābhyāmayam jāyeta iti samakalpatām, the two divinities determined this Vasiṣṭha shall be begotten by us
