## English translation:

“The **Bharatas**, inferior (to their foes), were shorn (of their possessions), like he staves for driving cattle,(stripped of their leaves and branches); but **Vasiṣṭha** became their family priest, and the people of the Tṛtsusprospered.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

People of the Tṛtsus: Tṛtsus are the same as the Bharatas. **Saṃvaraṇa**, the son of **Ṛkṣa**, thefourth in descent from **Bharata**, the son of **Duṣyanta**, was driven from his kingdom by the **Pāñcālas**, andobliged to take refuge with his tribe among the thickets on the **Sindhu** until Vasiṣṭha came to them andconsented to be the **rājā**'s purohit, when they recovered their territory
