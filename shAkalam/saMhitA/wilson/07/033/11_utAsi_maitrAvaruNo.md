**Puṣkara** = **kumbha**, pitcher used at sacrifice, or the vasatīvara, the pool ofwater prepared for the same. Vasiṣṭha was born when the vessel, puṣkara, was over-filled and some contentsfell upon the earth. **Agastya** was born of the contents in the vessel; the overflowing fluid being collected together,Vasiṣṭha remained in the lake, tato apsu gṛhyamāṇāsu vasiṣṭhāḥ puṣkare **sthitaḥ**; Puṣkara is also thename of a lake in **Ajmer**; **Padma Purāṇa** cites it as the hermitage of Agastya (**Sṛṣṭi** **khaṇḍa**)
