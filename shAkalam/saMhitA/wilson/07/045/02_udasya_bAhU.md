## English translation:

“May the outspread, vast, and golden arms of **Savitā** extend to the ends of the sky; verily his greatnessis glorified (by us); may the sun impart energy unto him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Suraścid **asmā** anudād apasyām = sūryo asminsavitre karmecchām anudadātu, may **Sūrya** subsequently give to that Savitā the desire for acts.
