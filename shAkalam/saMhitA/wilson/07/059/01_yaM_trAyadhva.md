## English translation:

“**Agni**, **Varuṇa**, **Mitra**, **Maruts**, grant happiness, gods, to him whom you preserve from (the perils of) this(world), whom you guide here (to the paths of virtue).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

From this world: yam trāyadhvam idam idam yam canayatha: idam = itas, from this, bhayahetoḥ, cause of peril;

Idam = sanmārgam, road of virtue
