Tryambaka: the father, **ambuka** of the three deities, **Brahma**, **Viṣṇu** and **Rudra**; also identified withmahatva (**Ṛgvidhāna**); whose fame is fragrant: **sugandhim** = prasāritapuṇya kīrtim, whose fame of virtue isspread; in like manner as the fragrance of a tree full in flower sheds sweetness, so spreads the fragrance of holyactions; the augmenter of increase: **puṣṭi** vardhanam, the augmenter of nutrition, jagad-vījam, the seed of theworld; or, the multiplier of good things subservient to objects of bodily enjoyment, wealh,śarīradhanādiviṣayān vardhayati yaḥ; may I be liberated: mṛtyor makṣiya = may I be liberated from theworld, or the revolutions of life and death; may I attain **mokṣa**;

Urvāruka = **karkaṭi**, a species of cucumber; or,**karkandhu**, which, when ripe falls of itself from its stalk; but not to immortality: māmṛtāt mā ā **amṛta**, not toor until the immortal or immortality; either the long life of the gods or **svarga** paradise;

Tryambaka =nātratrayopetām rudram, the triocular rudra;

Sugandhim = **divya** gandhopetam, of celestial fragrance (yathāvṛkṣasya sampuṣpitasya dūrādgandho vātyevam puṇyasya kṛrmaṇo dūrādgandho **vāti**: TaittirīyaĀraṇyaka)
