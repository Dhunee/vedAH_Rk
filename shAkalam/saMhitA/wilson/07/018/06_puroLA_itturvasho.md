## English translation:

“**Turvaśa**, who was presiding (at solemn rites), diligent in sacrifice, (went to **Sudāsa**) for wealth; but likefishes restricted (to the element of water), the **Bhrigus** and **Druhyus** quickly assailed them; of these twoeverywhere going the friend (of Sudāsa, **Indra**) rescued his friend.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The legend: Indra saves one of the two,Sudāsa (and perhaps slays the other), turvaśam avadhīt; matsyaso **niśitaḥ**, fishes limited to water; the peopleof the country **Matsya** were attacked by Turvaśa, tena matsyajanapada bādhitaḥ; śruṣṭim cakruḥ (applied tothe Bhrigus) = aśuprāptim cakruḥ; sukham turvaśasys cakruḥ-- making the Bhrigus and Druhyus the allies ofTurvaśa
