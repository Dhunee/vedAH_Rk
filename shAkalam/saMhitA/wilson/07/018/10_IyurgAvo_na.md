## English translation:

“They who ride on particoloured cattle, (the **Maruts**), despatched by **Pṛṣṇi** and recalling theengagement made by them with their friend (**Indra**), came like cattle from the pasturage, when left without aherdsman; the exulting **Niyut** steeds brought them quickly (against the foe).”
