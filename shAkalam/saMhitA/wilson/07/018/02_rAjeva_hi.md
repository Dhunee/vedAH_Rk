“You dwell with your glories like a **rājā** with his wives; **Maghavan**, who are wise and experienced,(reward our) praises with the precious metals, with cows, with horses; conduct us who are dependent on yourriches.”

With the precious metals: piśā, silver or gold, and the like; rūpeṇa hiraṇyādinā vā; **rūpa** mayalso mean beauty
