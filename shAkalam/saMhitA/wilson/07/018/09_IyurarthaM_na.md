## English translation:

“The waters followed their regular course to the Paruṣṇi, nor (wandered) beyond it; the quick courser(of the king) came to the accessible plural ces, and **Indra** made the idly-talking enemies, with their numerousprogeny, subject among men (to **Sudāsa**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra is said to have repaired the banks of the river so that thewaters -- iyur **artham** na nyartham-- went to their object, that is, their former bed, not below or beyond it; theenemies Amitrān are called vadhrivācaḥ or jalpakān
