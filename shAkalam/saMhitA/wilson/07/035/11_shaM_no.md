## English translation:

“May the divine universal gods be (favourable) to our felicity; may **Sarasvatī**, with holy rites, behappiness; may those who assist at sacrifices, those who are liberal of gifts. Be (conducive to) our happiness;may celestial, terrestrial and aquatic things be (subservient to) our happiness.”
