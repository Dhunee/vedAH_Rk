## English translation:

“May the divine preserving **Savitā** be (radiant for) our happiness; may the opening dawns (break for)our happiness; may **Parjanya** be (the granter of happiness) to our posterity; may **Śambhu**, the lord of strength,be (the conferrer of) happiness upon us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śambhu = sukhasya bhāvayitā, the cause of the condition ofpleasure; ordinarily, it is a name of **Śiva**
