## English translation:

“Offer, priests, the shining effused **Soma** o him who is eminent (among) men; knowing better than theGaura where his distant drinking-plural ce (is to be found). **Indra** comes daily seeking for the offerer of the libatioṇ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Knowing better: gaurād vedīyān avapānam = avakramya sthitam dūrastham pātavyam somamgauramṛgād api atiśayena = knowing the Soma that is to be drunk, though plural ced afar off, better than an ox ora deer knows the drinking plural ce of pond
