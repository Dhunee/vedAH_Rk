## English translation:

“What is to be proclaimed, **Viṣṇu**, of you, when you save. I am **Śipiviṣṭa**? Conceal not from us yourreal form, although you have engaged under a different form in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viṣṇu is said to have aided **Vasiṣṭha** inbattle under an assumed form, and, when questioned, is reported to have said: I am Śipiviṣṭa (śipayotrarasmaya ucyate tairāviṣṭo **bhavati**: **Nirukta** 5.7-8). Śipiviṣṭa = objectionable or unobjectionable. In thepreceding ṛca and the ṛca 7 of the preceding **sūkta**, the world is explained: penetrated, or clothed with rays oflight, raśmibhir **ariṣṭa**, the radiant, the splendid; it normally means, a man naturally without prepuce; just as aman is so denuded, so is Viṣṇu, according to his own declaration, uncovered by radiance-- tejasāanācchāditaḥ
