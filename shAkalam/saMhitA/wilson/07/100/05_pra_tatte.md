## English translation:

“Resplendent **Viṣṇu**, I, the master of the offering, knowing the objects that are to be known, glorifytoday your name; I who am feeble, praise you who are powerful, dwelling in a remote region of this worlḍ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nāmāryaḥ śaṃsāmi = I the lord, praise your name; **Sāmaveda** has a different reading: pra tat te adyahavyam **āryaḥ** śaṃsāmi = I the lord, offer you today an oblation;

**Sūrya** = **svāmī** stutinām haviṣām vā,you master of the praises or of the oblation which may mean Viṣṇu or perhaps, the **yajamāna**
