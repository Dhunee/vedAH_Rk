## English translation:

“Heaven and earth, abounding with food, abounding with cattle, yielding abundant fodder, you aredisposed to be liberal to the man (who praises you); you, **Viṣṇu**, have upheld these two heaven and earth, andhave secured the earth around with mountains.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To the man who praises you: manuṣe stuvate; **Yajus**. 5.16reads: manave = yajamānāya, to the instrumental tutor of the rite; have secured the erth: dādartham pṛthivīmmayūkhaiḥ: parvataiḥ, by mountains; or, by his incarnations displaying his glory, tejorūpair avatāraiḥ; cf. Tai.S. 3.4.5.1
