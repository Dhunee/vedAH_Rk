“The light of whom quickly spreads over the earth when with his teeth (of flame) he devours his food;your blaze rushes along like a charging host, when **Agni**, of goodly aspect, you spread with your flame (amongthe trees) as if (they were) barley.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You spread with your flame: yavam na dasma juhvā = darśanīyāgnertvam yavam iva jvālayā kāṣṭhādīni bhakṣayasi, when you eat wood and other things like barley, withflame
