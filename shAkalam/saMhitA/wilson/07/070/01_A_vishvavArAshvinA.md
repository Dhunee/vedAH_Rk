## English translation:

“All-adored **Aśvins**, come to our (sacrifice), to that plural ce on earth which has been designated yours,which, like a swift, broad-backed horse, awaits you, and on which you are seated as firmly as in a dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Likea... broad- backed horse: **śuna**-**pṛṣṭhaḥ** = sukhakara, plural asant, delightful, vipulatvāt, from its breadth; as firmlyas in a dwelling: a yat sadhatur dhruvase na yonik: dhruvāya nivāsāya sthānam iva, like a plural ce for adurable soil
