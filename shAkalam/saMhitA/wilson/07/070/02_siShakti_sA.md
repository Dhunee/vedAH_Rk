## English translation:

“This excellent praise, redolent of food, propitiates you; the ewer has been heated in the dwelling of theworshipper, which, reaching you, fills the ocean and the rivers (through the rain it obtains), associating you (inthe rite), like two well-matched horses in a chariot.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ewer: **gharma** = pravarga; **gharmaḥ** pravargaśca
