## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Varuṇa**, you have forced open by your strength the barriers of the waters; you haveestablished **Sūrya** as the lord in heaven; in the exhilaration of the inspiring (**Soma**) you have replenished the dry(beds of the rivers); do you also fulfil the objects of our sacred rite.”
