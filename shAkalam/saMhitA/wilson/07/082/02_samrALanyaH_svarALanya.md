## English translation:

“One of you it titled supreme monarch, so is the other; mighty and most opulent are you, **Indra** and all thegods in the highest heaven, showerers (of benefits), have combined your united strength, (your) maid vigouṛ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Supreme monarch; **Varuṇa** and Indra are called, respectively, **samrāj** ans svarāj (as inferred from RV2.041.06; and RV. 1.061.09);

Samjrāj = samyag rajamānaḥ, i.e. thoroughly splendent;

Svarāj = sur_ryamevanyanirapekṣayaive rajamānaḥ i.e. self-splendent, or not dependent for his lustre on anyone else
