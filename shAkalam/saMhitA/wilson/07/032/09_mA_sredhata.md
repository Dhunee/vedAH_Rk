## English translation:

“Offerers of the libation, do not hesitate; be active; sacrifice to the mighty benefactor for the sake ofriches; the assiduous worshipper conquers (his enemies), dwells in a habitation, and prospers; the gods favournot the imperfect rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Na devāsaḥ karatnave: karatnuḥ = **kutsita** **kriya**, bad or defective act of religion; men donot become gods by such means, **devā** na **bhavanti**
