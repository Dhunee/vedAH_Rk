## English translation:

“May the **brāhmaṇas**, the **Aṅgirasas**, be everywhere present; may Krandanu be conscious of (our)adoration; may the rivers glide along, distributing water; may the pious couple (the **yajamāna** and his wife),conjointly appreciate the beauty of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Krandanu = **Parjanya**; the rivers: dhenavaḥ = nadyaḥ,consistent with the phrase udapruto navantaḥ
