## English translation:

“The white-complexioned **Vāyu**, intelligent, glorious with the **Niyut** steeds, favours those men who arewell fed, abounding in riches, for they with one mind stand everywhere, ready to (worship) him, and leaders ofrites, they perform all the ceremonies, that are productive of excellent offspring.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Glorious with the Niyut steeds:niyutam abhiśriḥ is the resort or lord of the Niyuyt steeds, niyhutam abhiśrayaṇīyāḥ; those men who arewell-fed: the epithets are alternatively applied to the **Niyuts** or to adhyajanān, wealthy men
