## English translation:

“The sage, the solemnizer of sacrifice, the ancient hearer (of holy prayer), earnestly repeats, **Mitra** andVaruṇa, your praises; he whose prayers, doers of good deeds, you favour, whose acts (of worship) yourecompense not for years.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ancient hearer: dīrghaśrut = cirakālam **śrotā**, a hearer for a long time, anepithet of Vasiṣ.ha; you recompense not: ā yatkratvā na **śaradaḥ** pṛnaithe = yat **karma** bahūnsam;vatsarān apūrayethe, whose act you fill or fulfil many years;

Na = and, also, negative not; the merit of theworship is so great that it cannot be adequately rewarded except after a long period
