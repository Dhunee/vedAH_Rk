## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, your relationship is common and you have a common kinsman; let your protection abide nearme.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Two Aśvins were both born from the wife of the sun (Vicasvat), who had assumed the form of a mare (cf. RV7.72.2 and the passage from Bṛhaddevatā cited); common kinsman = sacrificial ladle or the ṛṣi himself; cf. RV8.27.10
