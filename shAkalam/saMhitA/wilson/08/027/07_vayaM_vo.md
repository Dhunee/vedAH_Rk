## English translation:

“Bearing the clipped sacred grass, offering in due order the (sacrificial) food, presenting the effusedSoma, and having the fires kindled, we invoke you, **Varuṇa**, (and the rest), as did **Manus**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Varuṇa: when Mitraand Varuṇa are named singly, both are intended, and sometimes even more of the **Viśvadevas**; cf. ŚathapathaBrāhmaṇa 1.8.1, **Manu**'s sacrifice
