## English translation:

“Drink you, who are worthy to be glorified, of this consecrated and juicy libation, like the first drinker(**vāyu**); this excellent effusion issues for your exhilaration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The first drinker Vāyu: pūrvapāḥ = vāyu, who,having arrived first in the race, drank the **Soma** before the other gods. The allusion is to the principal grahalibation, called Aindravāyava, which **Indra** and Vāyu share together: **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.25
