## English translation:

“You alight upon the effused **Soma** as the Hāridravā plural nges unto the water; you fall upon it like twobuffaloes (plural nging into a pool); united with the dawn and with **Sūrya**, come, **Aśvins**, by the triple path.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hāridravā: a tree; by the triple path: trir vartir yātam, the three daily ceremonies; or, come thrice to ourdwelling
