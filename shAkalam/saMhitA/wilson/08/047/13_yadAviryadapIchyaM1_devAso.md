## English translation:

“Deities, whatever evil is manifest, whatever is concealed, (let it be not found) in **Trita** Āptya, keep it farfrom us; your aids are void of harm, your aids are true aids.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trita Āptya is the ṛṣi of the hymn. Trita Āptyawas a deity dwelling in remote distance, and consequently evil was sought to be transferred to him; keep it farfrom us in Trita Āptya
