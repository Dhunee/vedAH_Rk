## English translation:

“As (in the sacrifice) we put severally together the proper parts and the hoofs, and as we discharge adebt, so we transfer all the ill-omened dream that rests on Āptya; your aids are void of harm, your aids are trueaids.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As in the sacrifice they plural ce together the **kalā**, the heart etc., as fit to be cut to pieces, and the **śapha**,the hoof, bones etc. as unfit; another explanation is: kalā = śapha or hoof. The words kalā and śapha occurtogether in **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 6.1.10, where the process of buying the **Soma** is desscribed;

Śapha = the eighthpart of a cow;

Kalā = a very small portion of a cow; that rests on Āptya: or, we transfer all the ill-omened dreamto Āptya
