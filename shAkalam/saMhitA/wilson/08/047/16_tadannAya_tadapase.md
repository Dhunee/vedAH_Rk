## English translation:

“Uṣas, bear (elsewhere) the ill-omened dream for **Trita** and **Dvita**, who eat and do (in dreams) that(which is eaten and done amiss when awake) and who obtain that (inauspicious) portion; your aids are void ofharm, your aids are true aids.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bear elsewhere: i.e., let the eating of honey etc., perceived in a dream, producehappiness as in a waking state; trita and dvita: for dvita, cf. **Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa** 1.2.3.1
