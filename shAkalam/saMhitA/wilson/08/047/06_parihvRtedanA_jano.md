## English translation:

“Only by painful means does a living man obtain the wealth which you bestow; but he whom you, divineĀdityas, visit, wins great (riches); your aids are void of harm, your aids are true aids.”

By painful means = bypenance, religious observances; a living ma: ana = **prāṇa**-**yuktaḥ**, endowed with life; (RV 4.30.3):prāṇarūpena balena; or, just a particle, 'certainly'; verily men succumb through the loss of the wealth given byyou?; āśa vaḥ = **āśavaḥ**, swiftly moving
