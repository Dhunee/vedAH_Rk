## English translation:

“As, **Indra**, inspirer (of men), your strength is irresistible, (so) invoked of many, your munificence to thedonor (of oblations) cannot be marred.”

Inspirer of men: nṛto = voc. of nṛtu, dancer, or who causes to dance, i.e.,agitator, exciter; from Indra's faculty of internal impulse in all beings, sarvasya antaryāmitayā nartayitaḥ
