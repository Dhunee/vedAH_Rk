## English translation:

“You acknowledge no friendship for the wealthy man (who makes no offerings); those who are puffed upwith wine offered you; when you instrumental tute (the sacrifice), you expelled niggardliness, and you are invoked as aprotector.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Surāśvaḥ = surayā **vṛddhāḥ** paramattāḥ, intoxicated, or, **nāstikāḥ**, atheists; yadā kṛṇoṣinadanum samūhasi = when you utter the inarticulate sound of approbation (to the worshipper, implying, 'he ismine'), you bring him (wealth); another interpretation: you never find a rich man to be your friend; wine-swillersdespise you; but when you thunder, when you gather (the clouds), then you are called like a father; as aprotector: or, as a father, **pitā** iva
