## English translation:

“Land with your hymns for our protection, **Agni**, whose splendour lie outspread; laud Agni for wealth, OPurumīḷha, for other offerers are lauding that far famed one on their own behalf; solicit of Agni a house for (me)Sudīti.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whose splendours lie outspread: śīraśociṣam, śayanasvabhāva rociṣkam; (RV 4.5.10): aśanaśīla jvālam
