## English translation:

“**Aṅgirasa**, son of strength, the ladles go to find you in the sacrifice; we praise the ancient **Agni** in ourofferings, the grandson of food, butter-haired.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Butter-haired: Agni is called ghṛtapṛṣṭhā, 'butter-backed' (RV.5.4.3); pradīpta **kalaśa** **sthānīya** **jvālāḥ**; pradīpta kalaśa = pradīpta **keśa**; cf. RV 5.37.1
