## English translation:

“O you brilliant wealth, let not the **rākṣasa** enter us, nor the torment of the evil spirits; **Agni**, drive awayfurther than a **gavyūti** from us poverty, hunger and the strong demons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gavyūti: this is a measure = twokrośas; it implies an unlimited distance;

Hunger: kṣudham = ksapayitāram, the destroyer
