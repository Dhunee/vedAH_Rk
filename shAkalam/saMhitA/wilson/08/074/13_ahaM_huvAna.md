## English translation:

“Summoned before Śrutarvān, the son of **Ṛkṣa**, the humbler of the pride of his enemies, (I stroke) withmy **hand** the heads of the four horses (which he has given me), as (men stroke) the long **wool** of rams.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With myhand: **vṛkṣā** = keśavantī; or, mṛkṣā, let me stroke
