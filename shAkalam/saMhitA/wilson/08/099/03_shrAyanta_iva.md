## English translation:

“As the gathering (rays) proceed to the son, so (the **Maruts** proceed) to **Indra**, and by their power divideall his treasures among those who have been or will be born; may we meditate on our share.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bhakṣata =bhajata (or, vibhajante?): (O worshippers), as the gathering (rays) proceed to the sun, so do you enjoy all thewealth of Indra; and let us possess like an inheritance the treasures which by his power (he distributes) to himthat has been or will be born;

Alternative: the gathering (rays) proceeding to the sun distribute all Indra'streasures (to living beings, as rain, corn etc.) may we too by our power leave these treasures as an inheritance tohim who has been or will be born
