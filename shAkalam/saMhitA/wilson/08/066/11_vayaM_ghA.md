## English translation:

“**Indra**, slayer of Vṛra, invoked of many, we, your many worshippers, offer new hymns to you, thunderer,as your wages.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Use of wages as an illustration is not inappropriate, as both the hymns and wages are given bya definite rul, niyamena
