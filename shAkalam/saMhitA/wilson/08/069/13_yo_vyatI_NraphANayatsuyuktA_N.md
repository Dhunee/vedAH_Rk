## English translation:

“He ho directs towards the worshiper his well-yoked prancing steeds-- he, (**Indra**), the swift bearer ofblessing, (produces) rain-- he, who being comparable only to himself is delivered (from all his enemies).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Comparable only to himself: **upamā** = **upamāna** **bhūta**; or, in close proximity
