## English translation:

“We offer praise with our hymns, as cows (low) to their calf in the stalls, to that handsome **Indra** of yours,(O priests), the overcomer of enemies, who rejoices in the excellent **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the stalls: svasareṣu; **Yāska**(**Nirukta** 5.4): days; we praise you in the days; excellent Soma: vasoḥ = vasayītuḥ; cf. RV 6.16.25
