## English translation:

“**Indra**, who is well-deserving of the hymn, looks down (with favour) upon us as a (thirsty) man (looksdown) on wells; and being well-plural ased he makes the energetic **Soma**-offerer his friend; Indra's gifts are worthyof praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His friend: yujam = ātmānam; he makes the skilled Soma-offerer his friend; alternative interpretatioṅhe makes the Soma the friend of the worshipper
