May the showering mountain-like (or filling, gratifying) **Maruts**, the sons of **Rudra**,allies in the battle-challenge which brings **Vṛtra**'s destruction; or, may the gods who shower wealth upon us, theRudras, and those who have stated festivals (**parvataḥ**), who are unanimous in the battle-challenge for thedestruction of Vṛtra-- may these gods with Indra at their head protect us and him who recites or mutters thepraises, or having accusative ulated wealth, offers oblations
