## English translation:

“I have received together (with my other gifts) six horses with their mares from te pious **Indrota**, the sonof **Atithigva**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Together: sacā: i.e. together with the gifts of **Ṛkṣa** and **Aśvamedha**; Indrota's gift is incidental andno part of the original sacrifice. The implied meanings could be: trees and horses used in the **yajña**
