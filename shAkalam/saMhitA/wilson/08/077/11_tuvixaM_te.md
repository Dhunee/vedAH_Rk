## English translation:

“Far-darting is your well-made auspicious bow, unfailing is your golden arrow; your two warlike arms areready equipped, destructively overthrowing, destructively piercing.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yāska** **Nirukta** 6.33: ṛdūpe cidṛdūvṛdhā; like two bees delighting in sweetness;

Ṛdu = **mṛdu**; **madhu**, **Soma**
