## English translation:

“The wide-traversing Sun, despatched by you, brings (to the world) all these (waters which you create);he brings hundreds of cattle and rice boiled in milk; it is **Indra** who slays the water-stealing boar.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sun (herecalled **Viṣṇu**), as the bringer of rain, is said to bring the cattle and food which the rain produces; the 'boar'**varāha** is a person nification of the cloud as smitten by Indra's thunderbolt (cf. **Nirukta** 5.4). **Taittirīya** Saṃhitā6.2.4 relates the legend: the person nified sacrifice concealed itself from the gods, and assuming the form ofViṣṇu, entered the earth. The gods, streching out their **hands**, sought in vain to lay hold of it; but wherever itturned, Indra, outstripping it, stood in front of it. It said to him, 'Who is this that, outstripping me, always stands infront of me?' He answered, "I slay in inaccessible plural ces'. Then, it said to him, 'You say that you can slay ininaccessible plural ces-- if this be so, the boar vāmamoṣa (vāmamuṣa in **Caraka** **Brāhmaṇa**) guards for theasuras, behind the seven mountains, the wealth which the gods must obtain; prove your title by slaying thatboar'. Indra, seizing up a tuft of **darbha** grass, pierced those mountains and slew him. Then he said to thesacrifice, 'You said that you could bring out from inaccessible plural ces; bring him out from there'. It brought out allthe instrumental uments of the sacrifice (i.e. the altar, **Soma** jars, cupṣ..) and gave them to the gods'. The CarakaBrāhmaṇa adds that the boar hid behind twenty-one stone cities. The seven mountains are the four dīkṣāsor initiatory rites and the three upasads; the boar vāmamoṣa (stealer of precious things) is the person nifiedceremony of pressing the Soma; see also RV 1.61.7
