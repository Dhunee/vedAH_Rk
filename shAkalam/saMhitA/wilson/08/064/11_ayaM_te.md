## English translation:

“This is your beloved most exhilarating **Soma** which grows in the Śaryaṇāvat lake by the Suṣomāriver in the Ārjikīya country.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śaryaṇāvat lake: cf. RV. 8.7.29 **adhi** **śritaḥ** = adhi **priyaḥ**; the lake is in the backpart of **Kurukṣetra**; Ārjikīya country: Soma thus grows in a very distant country;

Ārjikīya = name of theVipāśa (**Yāska**, **Nirukta** 9.26)
