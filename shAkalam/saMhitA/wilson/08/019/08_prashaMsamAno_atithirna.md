## English translation:

“**Agni**, when honoured like a guest, is gracious to his praisers; he is to be recognized as a chariot(bringing the fruit of the worship); in you verily the virtuous are confiding; you are the **rājā** of riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Confiding:or, perhaps, in you also are excellent protections, tva kṣemāso api **santi** sādhavaḥ
