## English translation:

“May these glory-conferring protecting **Soma**-streams knit together my joints as cows draw together achariot falling in pieces; may they keep us from a loosely-knit worship; may they deliver me from sickness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Cows:**gāvaḥ** = Soma streams, as the Soma is mixed with milk, and thus considered the product of the cows; aloosely-knit worship: when the Soma is drunk, the ceremony becomes consolidated
