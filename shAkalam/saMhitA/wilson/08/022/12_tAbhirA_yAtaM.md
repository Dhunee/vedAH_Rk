## English translation:

“Then, showerers, come to my manifold all-propitiating invocation with those (protections), with which,leaders (of rites), you, who are gratified (by oblations), munificent (in gifts), and the overcomers of numerous(foes), gave augmentation to the well; with such (protections) come here.”

Gave augmentation: the Aśvinsmiraculously filled the well with water, and so rescued **Vandana**
