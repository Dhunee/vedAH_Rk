## English translation:

“When Vāk, the **queen**, the gladdener of the gods, sits down (in the sacrifice) uttering things not to beunderstood, she milks water and food for the four quarters (of the earth); whither now is her best portion gone?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Nirukta** 11.28: Vāk here is the thunder; cf. RV 8.69.14; best portion = the rain, which sinks in the earth or istaken up by the sun's rays
