The legend (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 6.5.6): **Aditi** is represented asoffering a certain offering to the gods, and as conceiving four of the **Ādityas** on eating the remainder which theygave to her. Thinking to conceive a still nobler offspring, she next eats the whole of the second offering herself,but she only conceives a barren egg. She then offers the third offering to the Ādityas and conceives **Vivasvat**
