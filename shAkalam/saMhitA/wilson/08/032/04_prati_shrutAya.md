## English translation:

“I invoke the victorious handsome-jawed **Indra** for your protection, and to hear (your praises), as (atraveller invokes) the water from the cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Water from the cloud: tūrṇāśam na girer **adhi**: tūrṇāśa =**udaka** (tūrṇāśamudakam **bhavati** tūrṇamaśnute : **Nirukta** 5.16); as a man in hot weather calls for water fromthe cloud, yathā gharmebhitptaḥ **pumān** udakam megham **prati** hvayati
