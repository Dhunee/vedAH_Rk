## English translation:

“Verily no debt is due (to the gods) by those **Soma**-partaking **brāhmaṇas** offering libations; the Soma isnot drunk without the expenditure of boundless (wealth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Verily no debt is due: he who has a son, or is chaste, isfree from debt, i.e., to the gods and manes: eṣa vā anṛṇo yaḥ putrī yajvā brahmacārivāsī: TaittirīyaSaṃhitā 6.3.10.5; without the expendiure of boundless wealth: apratā = avistīrṇadhanena, by one who hasnot abundant wealth
