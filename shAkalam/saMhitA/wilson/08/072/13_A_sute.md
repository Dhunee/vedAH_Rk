## English translation:

“Drop into the milked (stream) the admixture, which reaches, (as it boils), heaven and earth; set the bullin the liquor.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Admixture: goat's milk which is poured into the cow's milk in the **gharma**; heaven and earth: theAśvins (**NIrukta** 12.1); bull in the liquor: **vṛṣabha** = bull, **Agni**;

**Rasa** = rase, liquor is the goat's milk. The goat isdedicated to Agni, hence the contact of its milk with fire is proper
