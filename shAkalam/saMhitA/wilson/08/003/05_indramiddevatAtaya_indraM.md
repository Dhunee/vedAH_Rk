## English translation:

“We invoke **Indra** for the worship of the gods, and when the sacrifice is proceeding; adoring him, we callupon Indra as the close of the rite; we invoke him for the acquisition of wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the close of the rite: samīkesampūrṇe yāge; or, it may mean saṅgrāme, in war
