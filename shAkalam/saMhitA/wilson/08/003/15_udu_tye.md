## English translation:

“These most sweet songs, these hymns of praise ascent (to you), like triumphant chariots laden withwealth, charged with unfailing protections, intended to procure food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like triumphant chariots: vājayantahannam icchanto rathā iva, though the epithets are plural masc., yet, they agree with rathāḥ
