## English translation:

“I solicit you, **Indra**, for such vigour and for such food as may be hoped for in priority (to others),wherewith you have granted to **Bhṛgu** the wealth taken from those who had desired from sacrifices, wherewithyou have protected prakṣaṇva.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Taken from those: yena yatibhyo **dhane** hite: yatibhyaḥ = karmasu uparatebhyoyaśtribhyo janebhyo sakāśād dhanam **āhṛtya**, having taken the wealth from men not offering sacrifices, orceasing to perform holy acts; the wealth given to Bhṛgu, for the benefit of the sages, the **Aṅgirasas**
