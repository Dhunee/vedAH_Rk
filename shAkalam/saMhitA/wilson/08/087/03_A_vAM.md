## English translation:

“The worshippers have invoked you with all protections; come in the early mornings to the dwelling ofhim who has clipped the sacred grass, to the offering loved (by all the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The worshippers: **priyamedhaḥ** =those whose sacrifices are acceptable; or, a reference to Ṛṣi **Priyamedha**; with all your protections: viśvābhirūtibhiḥ = with prayers for all desirable blessings
