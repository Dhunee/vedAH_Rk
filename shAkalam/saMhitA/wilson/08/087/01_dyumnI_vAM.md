## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, your praise is filled with plural nty as a well (with water) in time of rain; hasten here; it is especiallydear to the **Soma** when it is effused in the brilliant (offering); drink, leaders (of rites), as two **Gauras** (drink), at apool.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your praise is filled with plural nty: i.e., it brings abundance to the worshipper;

Dyumnī = glorious (RV 8.89.2);

Dyumnī = dyumnīka: Aśvins, Dyumnīka is your praiser
