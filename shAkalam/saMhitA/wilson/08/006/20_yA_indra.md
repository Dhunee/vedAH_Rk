## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Having taken into their mouths: tvā āsa- garbham acakriran, you with themouth the embryo they made; the plural nts that sprang up after the destruction of **Vṛtra** and the consequent fall ofrain, were the vigour (**vīrya**) of Indra, and by feeding upon them the cattle multiply. A legend from the kāṭhakais cited: After Indra killed Vṛtra, his virility (vīrya) passed into the waters, plural nts and trees, indrasya vai vṛtramjaghnuṣa indriyam vīryam apakrāmat tad idam sarvam anupraviśad apa oṣadhir vanaspatīn; **pari** dharmevasūryam, as the rays of the sun genitive rate the sustaining water above the solar orb, as if it was the germ orembryo of all things: **dharma** dhārakam poṣakam udakam raśmayo garbharūpeṇa bibhrati **tadvat**; or, thecomparison may be: yātha dhā **sūryaḥ** paritaḥ sarvam jagad dhatte tadvat kṛtsnasya jagato dhārakamindrasya vīryam, as the sun supports the whole world, so is the vigour of Indra, the sustainer of the universe
