## English translation:

“Whatever **Soma** the hawk bore for you with its feet, having won it, till then inviolate, from the (guardiansof the) upper worlds, drink it-- you are the sovereign.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whatever the hawk bore: legend in **Taittirīya** Saṃhitā6.1; **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 3.25-27: **gāyatri** as a hawk brought the Soma from heaven. The portions which sheseized with her feet became the morning and the midday libation, that which she seized with her bill became theevening libation
