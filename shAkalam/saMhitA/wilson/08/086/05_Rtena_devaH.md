## English translation:

“The sun-god by truth extinguishes his beams (in the evening); he spreads abroad (in the morning) thehorn of truth; truth verily overcomes the might of the eager assailant; therefore sever not our friendships, but flingloose (your reins and gallop here).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A praise of truth, satyapraśaṃsā; as the sun swerves not from hisappointed course, and as truth or adherance to right conquers earthly foes, so the **Aśvins** must fulfil the duties ofancient friendship and hear the ṛṣi's prayer
