## English translation:

“**Dasras**, physicians, sources of happiness, you both were (the objects) of **Dakṣa**'s praise; **Viśvaka** nowinvokes you for the sake of his son; sever not our friendships, but fling loose (your reins and gallop here).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Objects of Dakṣa's praise: an allusion to the thousand Ṛks uttered by Dakṣa or **Prajāpati**, i.e. the AśvināŚastra, which was won by the **Aśvins** in a race; cf. RV. 1.116.2; **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 45.7; sever not ourfriendships: as worshipper and object of worship
