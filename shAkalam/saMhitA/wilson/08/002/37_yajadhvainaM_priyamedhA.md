## English translation:

“Worship, **Priyamedha**, with mind intent upon him, that **Indra**, who is truthful when exhilarated by theSoma potations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Truthful: somaiḥ satyamadvā: truth, as applied to a vedic deity, means one who keeps faithwith his worshippers, who grants his prayers; so Indra, in his cups, is especially bountiful to those who praisehim
