## English translation:

“He, who visible above the earth sustains the points of the horizon, is the measurer (of the universe);that is the ancient abode of **Varuṇa**, to which we have access; he is our lord, like the keeper of cattle; may all ouradversaries perish.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Measurer: **mātā** = nirmātā, the maker
