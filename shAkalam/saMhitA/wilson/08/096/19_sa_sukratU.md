## English translation:

“He who noble in his exploits rejoices in the **Soma**-libations, he whose wrath cannot be repelled and whois wealthy as the days, he who alone performs the rites for his worshipper-- he, the slayer of **Vṛtra**, men say, is amatch for all others.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who is wealthy as the days: wealth is produced in the days, not in the nights
