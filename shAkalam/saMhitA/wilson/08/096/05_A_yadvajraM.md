## English translation:

“When, **Indra**, you grasp in your arms your pride humbling thunderbolt to smite Ahi, when the mountainclouds loudly roar and the cows loudly bellow, then the **brāhmaṇas** offer their worship to Indra.”

Cows: cowsare the waters pent within the clouds;

Brāhmaṇas = the mountains
