## English translation:

“"I have seen the swift-moving (demon) lurking in an inaccessible plural ce, in the depths of the riverAṃśumatī, (I have seen) **Kṛṣṇa** standing there as (the sun) in a cloud; I appeal to you, showerers; conquerhim in battle".”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This is **Indra**'s speech to the **Maruts**. Though the demon thinks he is concealing himself, he isseen as clearly by Indra as the sun is behind a cloud
