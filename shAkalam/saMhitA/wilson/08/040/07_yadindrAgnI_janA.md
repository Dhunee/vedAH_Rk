## English translation:

“Inasmuch as these people honour **Indra** and **Agni** with gifts and with praises, so may we, defying hosts,overcome (our foes) with our warriors; let us praise those seeking praise; may all our adversaries perish.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Seeking praise: vanuyāma vanuṣyataḥ = stutim icchantaḥ śatrūn vanuyāma; let us prevail over those whodesire to conquer
