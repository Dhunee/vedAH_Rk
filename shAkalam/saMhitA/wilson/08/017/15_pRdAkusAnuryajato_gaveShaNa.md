## English translation:

“With head uplifted like a serpent, adorable, the recoverer of the cattle, **Indra** single, is superior tomultitudes; (the worshipper) brings Indra to drink the **Soma** by a rapid seizure, like a loaded horse (by a halter).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With head uplifted: pṛdākusānu = pṛdākuḥ **sarpaḥ**, a serpent; sa iva **sānuḥ** samucchṛtaḥ tadvadunnataśiraskaḥ, having the head lifted up in like manner;

**Sānu** = saṃbhajanīya, to be served or propitiated asa snake is, with many gems, **mantras**, medicaments; sa yatha bahubhir maṇimantrauṣadhādibhis saṃsevyonālpai evam indropi bahubhis stotrādibhir yatnais **sevyaḥ**; by a rapid seizure: gṛbha = means of seizing, i.e. apraise
