## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vatsa = **yajamāna**, the sacrificer dear to Agni, as a calf, or child: vatsa **samaḥ** priyahh(**Yajus**. 12.115); would draw their thought: mano yamat = **mana** āyamavati; or, mana **āhṛtya** gṛhṇātimanonigraham **karoti**; tvāmāmayā **girā** = tvām kāmaye girā, I desire you with my hymn
