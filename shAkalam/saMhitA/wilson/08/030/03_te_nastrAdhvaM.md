## English translation:

“Do you preserve us, do you protect us, do you direct us (to our good); lead us not afar from the paternalpaths of **Manu**, nor from those still more distant.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

From the paternal paths of Manu: Manu is said to be theuniversal father, and the paths he enjoins are those of austerity and ceremonial. **brahmacarya** agnihotrādikarmāṇi yena mārgeṇa **bhavanti** tam evam asmānnayata; lead us not away from the far-reaching paternalpath of Manu, but away from any which is distant therefrom
