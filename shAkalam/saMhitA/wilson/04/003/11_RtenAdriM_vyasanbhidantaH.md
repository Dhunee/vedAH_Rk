## English translation:

“By the sacrifice, the **Aṅgirasas**, rending the mountain asunder, have thrown it open, and returned with the cows; the leaders (of holy rites) have arrived happily at the dawn, and the sun was manifest as **Agni** was engendered.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sun was manifest: an allusion to the early morning sacrifice with fire, probably instrumental tuted by the Aṅgirasas
