## English translation:

“Secure **Agni**, the king of sacrifice, the afflicter (of foes), the invoker (of the gods), the distributor of food through heaven and earth, the golden-formed, for your protection before (surprised by) sudden death.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Purā** tanayitnor acittāt = liṭ, before the unconsciousness of the thunderbolt; this implies a state of unconsciousness, or death as sudden as if the work of the thunderbolt
