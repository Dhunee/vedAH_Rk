## English translation:

“The **male** **Agni**, the showerer (of benefits), has been sprinkled by the genitive ine sustaining milk; the giver of food proceeds unswerving (from his course), and the sun, the shedder of rain, has milked the white (fluid) of the udder (of the firmament).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sun milked: duduhe pṛśnir **udhas**: prśni = **Sūrya**
