## English translation:

“May the oxen (draw) happily, the men (labour) happily; the plural ugh furrows happily; may the traces bind happily; wield the goad happily.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Happily: śunam **vāhāḥ** śunam **naraḥ**: śunam = sukham, sukham yathā **bhavati** tathā, so that plural asure is or may be; as a person nification it is the divinity through whose favour the work goes well, sukhakṛd **devaḥ**, who may be either **vāyu** or **Indra**
