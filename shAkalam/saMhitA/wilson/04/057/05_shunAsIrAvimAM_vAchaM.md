## English translation:

“**Śuna** and **Sīra** be plural ased by this our praise, and consequently sprinkle this (earth) with the water which you have reated in heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śuna and Sīra: śunāsīrau is in the dual, as the name of two divinities; śuna is dyudevaḥ, the deity of the sky, i.e., **Indra**; **sira** is **vāyu**; śuna, vāyu and sīra = **āditya** (**Nirukta** 9.40);

**Śunāsīra** = Indra
