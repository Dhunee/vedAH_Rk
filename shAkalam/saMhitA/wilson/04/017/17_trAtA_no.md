## English translation:

“Be our preserver, you who are looking (benevolently upon) all; a kinsman (to us); a supervisor (of all things), a bestower of felicity on those who are worthy (to offer) libations; a friend, a protector, a defender in the highest degree among defenders, a creator; (be you, who bestows) the world of heaven upon him who desires it, the giver to us of food.”
