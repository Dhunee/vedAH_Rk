## English translation:

“Some portion (of his strength) **Indra** derives from his mother, some portion from his father; he who, though his progenitor, has begotten (the world), and animates its vigour repeatedly, as the wind is driven by thundering clouds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His progenitor: **Prajāpati**; as the wind is driven by thundering clouds: The simile is applied to Indra: as the wind is impelled by thunder-clouds, so Indra is influenced by the hymns of the worshippers
