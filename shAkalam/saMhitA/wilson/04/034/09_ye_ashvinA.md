## English translation:

“**Ṛbhus**, who by your assistance (gratiied) the **Aśvins**, who (renovated your) parents, who (restored) the cow, who fabricated the horses, who made armour (for the gods), who separated earth and heaven, and who, the all-pervading leaders (of rites), accomplished (acts productive of) good results.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Svapatyāni cakruḥ = svapatana sādhanāni karmāṇi, acts, the means of accomplishing their good offspring or consequences; ye in the next verse may refer to te agrepat, they the first drikers, the **Soma** being first offered at the evening sacrifice to the Ṛbhus
