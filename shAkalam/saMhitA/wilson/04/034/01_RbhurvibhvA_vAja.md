## English translation:

“**Ṛbhu**, Vibhvan, **Vāja** and **Indra**, do you come to this our sacrifice, to distribute the precious things, for the divine work has indeed now desired the drinking (of the **Soma**) on the (appointed hours of the) days; therefore the exhilarating draughts are collected for you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The divine work has desired the drinking: **dhiṣaṇā** **devi**: **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** states: **Prajāpati** said to **Savitri**, these are your fellow-students, do you drink with them
