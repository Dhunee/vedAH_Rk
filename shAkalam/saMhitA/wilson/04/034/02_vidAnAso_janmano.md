## English translation:

“Resplendent with (sacrificial) food, prescient of your (celestial) birth, be exhilarated, **Ṛbhus** along with the Ṛtus; the inebriating draughts are collected for you as well as pious praise; do you confer upon us riches with excellent posterity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Prescient of your celestial birth: vidānāsojanmanaḥ = jananasya **devatva** lakṣaṇasya devatva prāptim jānantaḥ, knowing the attainment of deification
