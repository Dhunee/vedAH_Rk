## English translation:

“Sympathizing in satisfaction with **Varuṇa**, drink, **Indra**, the **Soma** juice; drink it, you who are entitled to praise, sympathizing with the **Maruts**; drink, sympathizing with the first drinkers, with the drinkers (at the sacriices) of the Ṛtus; sympathizing with the protectresses of the wives (of the gods), the giver of wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛtus: ṛtupābhiḥ = ṛtuyajadevaiḥ, the deities to whom the ṛtu sacrifice is dedicated; wives of the gods: gnāspatnībhiḥ = wives of the gods, strīṇām pālayitryaḥ, the feminine le protectors of women, implying the goddesses
