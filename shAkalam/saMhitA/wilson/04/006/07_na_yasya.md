## English translation:

“Of whom, progenitor (of mankind), the benevolence is never checked; whose parents need not urge him to exertion; so that the well-satisfied, purifying **Agni** shines like a friend among men, the descendants of **Manu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whose parents need not urge: na mātarā pitarā nū cid iṣṭau, nor mother and father, i.e., heaven and earth, are quickly powerful in urging him; yasya preṣaṇe kṣipram eva na prabhavataḥ; descendants of Manu: mānuṣiṣu vikṣu, may mean only human beings
