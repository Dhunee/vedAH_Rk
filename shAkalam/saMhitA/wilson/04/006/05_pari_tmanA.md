## English translation:

“**Agni**, the sacrificer, the exhilarator, the sweet-spoken, the object of sacrifice, moving measuredly, circumambulates (the victim) of his own (accord); the bright (rays) of him (fed) with (sacrificial) food, spread around; all the regions are alarmed when he blazes.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bright rays: **asya** vājino na **śokā** = **aśva** iva dīptayo **dravanti**, his rays spread fast like horses
