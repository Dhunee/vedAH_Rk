## English translation:

“When the sacred grass is strewn and the fire is kindled, the **Adhvaryu** rises, propitiating (the gods), and **Agni**, the offerer of the oblation, ancient and multiplying (the offering), thrice circumambulates (the victim) like a keeper of cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thrice circumambulates: paryagnistriveṣṭyeti, Agni goes round, having thrice returned, trir āvṛtya paryeti, or trirhi paryagniḥ kriyate, Agni is thrice made around, which would imply that the fire was thrice circumambulated; the next stanza, however, clearly shows that it is Agni who goes round, either the altar or the victim; perhaps, it is the latter: parito gacchati paśum
