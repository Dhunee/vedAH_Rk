## English translation:

“You elevate those, of whom **Indra** is chief, above the vast clouds; for these, (your worshippers), you provide dwelling (plural ces) filled in habitations; as when advancing they detained you, so in like manner at your command they stayed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Yathā yathā patayantaḥ gaccandas tvam viyemire evaiva tasthuḥ savāya te: tavanujñayā eva tiṣṭhanti, probably this applies to the worshippers
