## English translation:

“The divine **Savitā** has been manifested; he is at once to be glorified by us; he is to be praised by the priests at the present (rite), and at the close (of the day), in order that he who apportions precious things to be descendants of **Manu** may bestow upon us, on this occasion, most excellent wealth.”
