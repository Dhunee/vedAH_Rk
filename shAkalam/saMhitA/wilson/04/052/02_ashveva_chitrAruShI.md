## English translation:

“Like a beautiful mare, the radiant mother of the rays of light, the object of sacrifice, (she) is the friend of the **Aśvins**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mother of the rays of light: **mātā** gavām = raśmiṇām mātā; she is the friend of the aśvins: the aśvins are to be worshipped together with the Dawn; since gavām = rays of light, the phrase **gavām ayana** relates to the winter solstice when the **mahāvrata** is initiateḍ
