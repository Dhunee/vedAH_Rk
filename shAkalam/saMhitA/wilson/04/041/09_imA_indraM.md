## English translation:

“These my earnest praises approach **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, desirous to obtain wealth, as dependants attend (upon an opulent man) for the sake of riches, like humble (feminine les) begging for food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As dependants attend upon an opulent man: joṣṭāra iva vasvo = sevakā dhanikam svāminam, as servants upon a rich master, or as derived from juṣ, to plural ase, joṣṭāraḥ = flatterers, parasites; like humble feminine les: raghvīr iva śravaso bhikṣāmāṇāḥ: raghvīr iva = laghvya iva, like light or trivial
