## English translation:

“May **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, the overthrowers (of foes), be around us with (their) protections; (that thereby we may have) good sons and grandsons, and fertile lands, and long life, and virility.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be around us: paritakmyāyām = paritakane, in the night, i.e. may Indra and Varuṇa protect us in the night against evil spirits; long life: sūro dṛśike = sūryasya cirakāladarśanāya, for the sight of the sun for a long time, i.e. cirajivanāya, for long life
