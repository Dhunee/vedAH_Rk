## English translation:

“Liberal givers, those (our) praises soliciting (abundant) food have proceeded to you for (your) protection; longing for you as (soldiers long) for battle, and as cattle approach the **Soma** for (its) advantage, so my heartfelt hymns (approach) **Indra** and **Varuṇa**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Longing for you: yuvayuḥ = yuvam kāmayamānaḥ; approach the soma for its advantage: śriye na **gāva** upa **somam** asthuḥ, an allusion to the mixture of milk and curds with the Soma libation, dadhyādiśrayaṇāya\].
