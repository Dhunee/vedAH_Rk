## English translation:

“Desirous of (possessing) cattlle, we have recourse to you, **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, for full protection, you who are powerful and kind as (kinsmen); we have recourse to you, adorable heroes, for (your) friendship and affection, (to you who are), like parents, givers of happiness.”
