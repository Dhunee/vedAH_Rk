## English translation:

“May we of our own (right) be the masters of permanent riches, comprising horses, chariots, and nourishment; may those two, traversing (the regions), direct their **Niyut** steeds towards us, associating (them) with riches and with recent protections.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May we of our own be: tmanā **patayaḥ** **syāma**, without any effort or labour, aprayatnena
