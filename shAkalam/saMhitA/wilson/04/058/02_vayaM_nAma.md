## English translation:

“We celebrate the name **Ghṛta** at this sacrifice, we offer it with adoration; may the four-horned **Brahmā** listen to its being glorified; the fair-complexioned-deity perfect this rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The four-horned brahmā: brahmā **catuḥ** **śṛṅgaḥ**: brahmā, the **mantra**; parivṛḍho **devaḥ**, the augmented, developed, or great deity; his four horns are the four **vedas**; Brahmā is also explained as Ṛtij, priest; the fair-complexioned deity perfects this rite: avamid-**gaura** etat: gaura = **yajña**, with epithets catuḥ **śṛṅga**, the sacrifice with four priests, obtains the object for which it is solemnized; the verse is said to apply to **Agni** as the sun; but it is applied to ghī. Since ghī is the secret name for **Soma**, the object for which it is solemnized is Soma
