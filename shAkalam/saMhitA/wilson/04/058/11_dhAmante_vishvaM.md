## English translation:

“The whole world, (**Agni**), finds an asylum in your effulgence, whether it be in the ocean, in the heart (of man), in the life (of living beings), in the assemblage of the waters, or in warfare; may we attain the sweet-flavoured wave which is established in your (essence).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Dhāman** te viśvam bhuvanam adhiśritam: dhāman = **tejaḥ** sthāne, in the plural ce of brightness or heat (or vibhutyam, superhuman power); the purport is to identify all things with Agni, present in the ocean as submarine fire, in men as **vaiśvānara**, an etymological pun from **viśva**, all and **nara**, man; in life, āyuṣi, as the vital principle, or **āyus**. may mean food, **anna**, when the digestive fire is intended; in the assembled waters or the firmament, as lightning; in war, as the metaphorical fire of valour; that sweet-flavoured wave: **ūrmiḥ** ya ābhṛtaḥ, the wave which is so deposited, sthāpitaḥ, may imply either the butter of the oblation, or water in the shape of rain. The reference to **madhu** in this and previous verse, establish that the implied reference is o **Soma**
