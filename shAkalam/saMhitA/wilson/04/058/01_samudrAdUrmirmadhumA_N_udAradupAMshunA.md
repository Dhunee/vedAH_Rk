## English translation:

“The sweet water swells up from the firmament; by the (solar) ray (man) obtains immortality; that which is he secret name of clarified butter is the tongue of the gods, the navel of ambrosia.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 17.89-99; the sweet water swells up from the firmament: samudrād urmir **madhumān** udārat: the meaning depends on the variants of meaning of **samudra**: samodante asmin **yajamānaḥ**, that in which worshippers delight, sacrificial fire; or, samudrād **dravanti** āpaḥ, that from which waters rush, celestial fire, lightning;

**Ūrmi** = reward or consequence; second occurrence of ūrmi = rain; in the latter sence of ūrmi, samudra may mean antarkṣa, the firmament; samudra may also mean the udder of the cow, whence flows milk, samudravati, from which come ūrmi, ghi or butter; another interpretation restricts the objects to two: ghī and **agni**, atra annādhyāsena ghṛtam stūyate prāṇādhyāsena ca **agniḥ**; as a representative of food, ghī is here praised, as that of vitality, agni; samudra is the ocean of ghī, from which it rises as its wave, samudrād **ghṛta**-mayad madhumān rasavān ūrmirudagacchat, and, having so risen, it pervades immortality by Agni, as the life of the world with whom it is combined: udgatya ca sa ūrmir-ansunā jagatprāṇabhūtenāgninā samaikibhūya amṛtatvān vyāpnoti; in both interpretations, agni is intended, with whom ghī, as the material of the oblation, is meant to be identified. That which is the secret name: ghṛtasya **nāma** guhyam yad **asti** **jihvā** devānām amṛtasya **nābhiḥ**: i.e., the material of sacrifice commonly called ghī is, in the **mantras** of the **Veda**, designated the tongue of the gods, being used metonymicaly for Agni; also the navel or binding, that is, the means of securing immortality for him who offers it in oblations. Since the ghṛta is intented to be the secret name, the reference intended may be to another principal oblation: the **Soma**
