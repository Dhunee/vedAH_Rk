## English translation:

“Four are his horns; three are his feet; his heads are two, his **hands** are seven; the triple-bound showerer (of benefits) roars aloud; the mighty deity has entered among men.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This verse is preferentially applied to **Agni**, identified either with **yajña** or with **Āditya**; the four horns of the yajña are the four **vedas**; of Āditya, the four cardinal points of the horizon; the three feet of yajña are the three daily sacrifices; of Āditya, morning, noon, evening; the two heads of yajña are two particular ceremonies termed brahmaudanam and **pravargya**; of Āditya, day and night; the seven hands of yajña are the seven metres; of Āditya, the seven rays, or the six seasons and their aggregate, or the year, the seventh; the term **vṛṣabha** phalānām vaṛsitā, the rainer of rewards, applies to yajña and Āditya; so does roraite, he roars, implying the noise made by the repetition of the **mantras** of the vedas; the three bonds of yajña are: **mantra**, **kalpa** and **brāhmaṇa**, the prayer, the ceremonial; the rationale of Āditya, the three regions, earth, mid-air and heaven; another view is to limit vṛṣabha kāmānam varṣitā to yajña; the four horns are the priests: the **hotā**, **udgātā**, **adhvaryu** and **brahmā**; the three feet are the three vedas; the two heads the **havirdhāna** and pravargya rites; the hands are the seven priests, or seven metres; the three bonds the three daily sacrifices; **Nirukta** 13.7 applies the verse to yajña
