## English translation:

“They flow uninterruptedly like plural asing rivers, purified by the mind that is seated in the heart; these streams of Ghī descend (upon the fire), like deer flying from the hunter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The allusion is to the ghī poured from the ladle on the fire; antahṛdā **manasā**: hṛdayamadhya gatena cittena, by the mind gone within the heart;

Śūghanāsaḥ: āśu gantryaḥ (**Nirukta** 6.1)
