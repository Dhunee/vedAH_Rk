## English translation:

“These hundred-channeled showers fall from the heart-delighting firmament, unobserved by the hostile (cloud); I look upon these showers of Ghī, (and behold) the golden **Vetasa** in the midst of them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Samudra**, the showers is implied by the epithet **śata** **vraja**, copious, either of water or ghī;

Vetasa = **Agni**, either as lightning or the sun; or the fire of sacrifice; another interpretation: etā arṣanti, **vācā** udgacchanti, these words originate from the ocean of the water of faith, purified by the metres and other supplementary portions of the **Vedas**, amidst which words the ṛṣis see the golden form of Agni, for Agni is the deity presiding over speech, or holy texts, agnir hi vacām **adhiṣṭhātri** **devatā**
