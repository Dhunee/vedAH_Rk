## English translation:

“The stream of Ghī fall copious, swift as the wind, and rapid as the waters of a river down a declivity, breaking through the confining banks, and hurrying on with their waves, like a high-spirited steed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Swift as the wind: **vāta** pramiyaḥ vayūvat prakṛṣṭavega; the comparison may be to **Sindhu**, a river agitated by the wind; breaking through the confining banks: **kāṣṭhā** bhindan urmibhiḥ pinvamānaḥ: kāṣṭhā = limiting circles; maryādābhūtān paridhīn limits within which the flowing butter increases with its juice; **ghṛta** may also mean water, when sindhu will imploy **antarikṣa**
