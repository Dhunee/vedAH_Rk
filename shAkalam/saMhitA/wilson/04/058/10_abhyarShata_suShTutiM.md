## English translation:

“(Priests) address the pious praise, (the source) of herds of cattle; bestow upon us auspicious riches; convey this our sacrifice to the gods, (where at) the streams of Ghī with sweetness descend.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Priests: the text has no nominative native; Ṛtvijaḥ, priests are impied; an alternative implied term may be **devāḥ**, gods; the pious praise the source of herds of cattle: suṣṭutim gavyam ājim: ājim = gosambandhinām saṅghātam, the number or collections related to cattle; or, it may mean the abundance of water; another interpretation: **agni** = **yajña** (sacrifice);

**Gavya** = ghī; gods, approach the pious praise, and, the sacrifice at which ghī is offered
