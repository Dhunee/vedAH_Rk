## English translation:

“**Agni** may be the officiating priest at the sacrifice, or the master of the house in the sacrificial chamber, or he sits down as the **Brahman**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The officiating priest at the sacrifice: uta gna agnir **adhvara**: gna = **devapatnī**, a wife of a deity; one reading: agnir yaje devapatnir yajati, Agni worships the wives of the gods at the sacrifice; or, gna = gacchan, going, may relate to the **adhvaryu**, who moves about the ceremonial
