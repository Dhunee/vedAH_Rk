## English translation:

“Slayer of **Vṛtra** you have restored the (one who was) blind, the (other who was) lame, both abandoned by their kin); (it is not possible) to exceed the happiness what is given by you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Blind and lame: in an earlier passage, blindness and lameness were attributed to one person n, Parāvṛja (son of Agru); here, the dual jahitā (for jahitau) and dva (for dvau), the two are used
