## English translation:

“You have slain at once those two **Āryas**, **Arṇa** and **Citraratha**, (dwellig) on the opposite (bank) of the **Sarayu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Those two Āryas: **āryā** = āryābhimānau, āryatvabhimāninau, presuming on their dignity as āryas, and being without any faith or devotion
