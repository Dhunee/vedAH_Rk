## English translation:

“The lord of acts, the wise **Indra**, has borne across (their difficulties), **Turvaśas** and **Yadu**, when denied inauguration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Apārayat =he enabled to cross; i.e., he made them worthy to be inaugurated or crowned which they were not at first, as the text implies by asnātārau, not bathers; allusion is to their exclusion from the succession in favour of the young son **Puru** by their father **Yayāti**
