## English translation:

“Destroyer of foes, may the divine **Aryaman** distribute your precious wealth; (may) **Pūṣa** (bestow it), (may), **Bhaga** (bestow it); may the toothless deity bestow the desired wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The text has: vāmam **pūṣā** vāmam bhago vāmam **devaḥ** karūḷatī: the triple repetition of **vāma**, vananīyam, dhanam would seem to separate not only Bhaga, but **Karu**.latī from **Pūṣan**;

Karūḷatī = kṛttadanta or adantaka, the broken-toothed, or toothless, this term seems to apply to Pūṣan; the legend: pūṣā prapiṣṭabhāgo adantako hityādi śrutiṣu (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.6.8.5); **Viṣṇu Purāṇa**, 67 has Pūṣan whose teeth were knocked out by **Vīrabhadra**'s followers at **Dakṣa**'s sacrifice
