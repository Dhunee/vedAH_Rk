## English translation:

“That embryo did not beguile me into satisfaction, but by the keen energy (of divine wisdom), I triumphed over it; the impeller of all, the sustainer of many, abandoned the foes (of knowledge), and, expanding, passed beyond the winds (of worldly troubles).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The impeller of all: the **paramātmā**, or **supreme spirit**; beyond the winds: the vital airs, or life, the cause of worldly existence, which is pain
