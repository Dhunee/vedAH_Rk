## English translation:

“When the hawk screamed (with exultation) on his descent from heaven, and (the guardians of the **Soma**) perceived that the Soma was (carried away) by it then, the archer of **Kṛśānu**, pursuing with the speed of thought, and stringing his bow, let fly an arrow against it.”
