## English translation:

“Being still in the germ, I have known all the births of these divinities in their order; a hundred bodies of metal confined me, but as a hawk I came forth with speed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e., until the sage comprehended the differences between the body and **soul**, and learned that soul was unconfined, he was subject to repeated births; but in this stage he acquired divine knowledge, and burst through the bonds with the force and celeriy of a hawk from its nest; **vāmadeva** **śyena** rūpam āsthāya garbhād yogena nihsṛtaḥ = Vāmadeva, having assumed the form of a hawk, came forth from the womb by the power of **Yoga** (Nītimañjari)
