## English translation:

“Purified (by holy acts) I bring to you, **Vāyu**, the **Soma**, first (offered to you at sacrifices) that seek to gain heaven; deity, who are ever longed over, come with your **Niyut** steeds to drink the Soma juice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 27.30; purified by holy acts: **śukraḥ** vratacaryādinā dīpto aham, illustrious by observing vows; I bring to you the Soma, first offered: ayāmi te madhvo agram: madhvoḥ = madhum;

Ayāmi = prāpayāmi;

Agram = itarebhyaḥ pūrvam; alternative reading: may the cup (**śukra** **graha**) come to you, ayāni, āgacchatu, which is the essence of the Soma, agram sārabhūtaḥ madhunaḥ rasasya\].
