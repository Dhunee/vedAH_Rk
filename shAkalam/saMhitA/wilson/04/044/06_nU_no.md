## English translation:

“**Dasras**, mete out for us both great opulence, comprising many descendants, since the leaders of the rite (the Purumīḷhas), have addressed to you, **Aśvins**, their praise, and the Ajamīḷhas have united with it their laudation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For us both: the two ṛṣis, the authors of the **sūkta**
