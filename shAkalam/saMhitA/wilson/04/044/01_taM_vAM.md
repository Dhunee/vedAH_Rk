## English translation:

“We invoke, **Aśvins**, today, your rapid car, the associator of the solar ray; the banked car which bears **Sūrya**, vast, wealthy, and laden with praises.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Associator of the solar ray: saṅgatim goḥ = goḥ saṅgamayitāram, the bringer into union, or associator of Go; the basis is the connection of the Aśvins with light, or the sun
