## English translation:

“**Indra** has filled the youthful rivers, the parents of plural nty, the corroders (of their banks), like armies destructive (of their foes); he has inundated the dry lands, and (satisfied) the thirsty travellers; he has milked the barren cows whom the **asuras** had become the lords of.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He has milked the barren cows: adhok staryo daṃsupatnīḥ, i.e., he has removed the barrenness occasioned by the grief of their separation by rescuing the cattle carried off by the **Paṇi**
