## English translation:

“As elders (send forth their young), so the gods have sent you (against **Vṛtra**); thence you became, **Indra** who is the abode of truth, the soverign of the world; you have slain the slumbering Ahi for (the release of) the water and have marked out (the channels of) all the delighting rivers.”
