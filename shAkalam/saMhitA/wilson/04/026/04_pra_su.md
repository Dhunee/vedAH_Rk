## English translation:

“May this bird, **Maruts**, be pre-eminent over (other) hawks, since with a wheelless car the swift-winged bore the **Soma**, accepted by the gods, to **Manu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With a wheelless car: acakrayā vadhayā = cakrarahitena rathena, with a car without wheels; the text has havyam, this is a metonymy for the Soma, which is said to have been brought from heaven by the **gāyatrī**, in the form of a hawk; by the hawk, we are to understand the **supreme spirit**, **parabrahma**
