## English translation:

“I have been **Manu** and **Sūrya**; I am the wise ṛṣi: **Kakṣīvat**; I have befriended **Kutsa**, the son of **Arjuni**; I am the far-seeing **Uśanās**; so behold me.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Attributed to **Vāmadeva**: the sage uttered the verse and the following two verses, while yet in the womb, knowledge of truth being genitive rated in him, and enabling him to identify himself with universal existence; through the eye of supreme truth I am everything, **paramārtha** dṛṣṭyā kṛtsnam aham asmityarthaḥ, we have, thus, the statement of the pantheistic basis for **Vedānta**
