## English translation:

“May Dadhikrāvaṇ, the active, the cherisher, the giver of cattle, who abides with the devout, the swift-going, be willing to accept (the sacrificial) food at the time of the desirable dawn; may he who is true, moving, rapid, and leaping like a grasshopper, produce (for us) food, strength and heaven.”
