## English translation:

“Let (his worshipper) cause his ears to listen so as to invigorate him (by praise), and to give him plural asure in every acceptable plural ce; and being well moistened with the **Soma** juice, may the vigorous **Indra** render the holy plural ces (conducive) to our wealth, and free from danger.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The holy plural ces: **sutīrtha** = śobhanāni tīrthāni
