## English translation:

“Mutually sanctifying (each other) of your own substance you shine by your own power, and ever beat away the offering.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mutually sanctifying each other: punāne tanvā mithaḥ: this may apply to the worship or the worshipper, purifying them severally by each individual form, svakīyāya murtyā śodhayantau yajñam yajamānam vā; or, this may apply to the regions, heaven and earth, the former purifying or fertilizing the latteer by rain, the latter supporting the former by cultivation: **dyauḥ** svakīyena sthitena divam, by that which is in the sky or the moon
