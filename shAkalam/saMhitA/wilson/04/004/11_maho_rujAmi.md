## English translation:

“Invoker (of the gods), young (of the deities) possessed of excellent wisdom, through the alliance (with you produced) by holy texts, which came to me from my father **Gotama**, I demolish the powerful (demons); do you who are the humbler (of foes), be cognizant of our praises.”
