## English translation:

“Do you, who are most rapid, direct your (flames) against opposing (rays), and, unresisted, become the protector of this your people against the calumniator who is remote or who is nigh; let no malevolent (foe) prevail against us (who are) your worshippers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Direct your flames against opposing rays: **prati** spaśo viṛja: spaśaḥ = parabādhakān raśmin; or, it may mean, caran, spies, sent to determine between true and false, satyanṛtavivekāītham; praṇidhin may also mean binders, imprisoners, bandhanakṛtāḥ
