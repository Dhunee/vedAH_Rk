## English translation:

“Those your protecting (rays), **Agni**, which, beholding (what had chanced), preserved the blind son of **Mamatā** from misfortune; he, knowing all things, cherished those benevolent (rays), and his enemies, intending to destroy him, wrought him no harm.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Preserved the blind son: an allusion to the legend of the birth of **Dīrghatamas**, who recovered his sight by worshipping Agni; cherished those benevolent rays: **rakṣa** tān sukṛto viśvavedā: viśvavedas may apply to Agni or to Dīrghatamas; by adding, bhavān, your honour, the term seems to apply to Agni
