## English translation:

“Sharp-weaponed **Agni**, rise up; spread wide (your flames) against (the **rākṣasas**); entirely consume the foes; blazing Agni, burn down him who acts as an enemy towards us like a piece of dry timber.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who acts as an enemy: āratim cakre may also mean, who annuls or prevents our donation, one who makes a gift no gift
