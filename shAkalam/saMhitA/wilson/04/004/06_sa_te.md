## English translation:

“He experiences your good favour, young (of the gods), who offers praise to you a **Brahman**, coming quickly (to bestow felicity); to him are all prosperous days and wealth (of cattle) and treasures; do you as the lord of sacrifice, shine upon his dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A brahman coming quickly: ivate brahmaṇe, i.e., parivṛdhāya, to the greatly augmented; shine upon his dwelling: aryo vi duro abhidyaut, he the worshipper especially shines over his house, aryo yajamāno gṛhān abhi viśeṣeṇa dyotate
