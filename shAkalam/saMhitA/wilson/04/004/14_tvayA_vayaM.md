## English translation:

“**Agni**, who are freed from shame, by you we are made opulent; by you we are protected; may we, through your guidance, attain abundant food; cherisher of truth, destroy both (sorts of calumniators), those who are nigh, those who are far off, and in due course fulfil (our desires).”
