## English translation:

“The gloom-dispelling, affluent Dawns animate the pious worshippers to offer (sacrificial) treasure; may the churlish (traffickers) sleep on unawakened, in the unlovely depth of darkness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The churlish traffickers: paṇaya = **vaṇijaḥ**, i.e., adātāraḥ, non-givers
