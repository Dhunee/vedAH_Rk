## English translation:

“While we glorify the name of the great Dadhikrā the means of sustenance and of strength, the prosperity of those who praise (him), let us invoke (also) for our welfare **Varuṇa**, **Mitra**, **Agni**, and **Indra**, the bearer of the thunderbolt.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of those who praise him: the text has marutām **nāma** bhadram: marutām = stotṛṇām, of the praisers
