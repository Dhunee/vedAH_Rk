## English translation:

“I send my prayer as a messenger to the **ṛbhus**; I solicit (of them) the cow, the yielder of the white milk, for the dilution (of the **Soma** libation); for they, as swift as the wind, the doers of good works, were borne quickly across the firmament by rapid steeds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

WSere borne quickly: as applicable to the deified mortals, the allusion is to their being transported to the sphere of the gods; if the reference is to the rays of the sun, it implies merely their dispersal through the sky
