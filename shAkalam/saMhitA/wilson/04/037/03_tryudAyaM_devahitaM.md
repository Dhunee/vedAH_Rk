## English translation:

“As the offering suited to the gods at the third (daily) sacrifice supports, you, **Vājas**, Ṛbhukṣans; as the praise (then recited supports you); therefore, like **Manu**, I offer you the **Soma** juice, along with the very radiant (deities) among the people assembled at the solemnity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I offer you: juhve manuṣvat uparasu vikṣu yuṣme sacā bṛhad diveṣu **somam**: upara = those who are plural ased or sport near the worship of the gods, devayajana samīpe ramantaḥ; tāsu vikṣu-prajāsu = in or among such people; bṛhaddiveṣu is an epithet of deveṣu implied
