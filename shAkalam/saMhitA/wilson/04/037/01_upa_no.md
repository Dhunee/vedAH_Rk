## English translation:

“Divine **Vājas**, **Ṛbhus**, come to our sacrifice by the path travelled by the gods, inasmuch as you, gracious (Ṛbhus), have maintained sacrifice among the people, (the progeny) of **Manu**, for (the sake of) securing the prosperous course of days.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhus: the text has ṛbhukṣaḥ, nominative sing. of **ṛbhukṣin**, a name of **Indra**; here, it is equated with **ṛbhavaḥ**, plural nominative of **ṛbhu**; in the following verses ṛbhukṣāṇaḥ is used, the nominative or voc. plural of ṛbhukṣin
