## English translation:

“From the **Ṛbhus** may wealth, the best and most productive of food, (come to me); that which the leaders of rites renowned together with the **Vājas**, have engendered; that which has been fabricated by Vibhvan and is to be celebrated at sacrifice; that which, deities you protect, that is to be beheld.”
