## English translation:

“Those (steeds), **Bṛhaspati**, which had come from that distant (region), the best (of all), have sat down in connection with the ceremony, and to you the **Soma** juices expressed by the stones flow copiously, (accompanied) by the sounds of praise, like deep wells that supply water.”
