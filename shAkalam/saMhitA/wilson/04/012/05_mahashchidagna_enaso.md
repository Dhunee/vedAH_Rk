## English translation:

“Let not us, **Agni**, who are your friends, ever suffer harm from any great or comprehensive offence against either gods or men; bestow forgiveness upon our sons and grandsons, the reward of what has been well done.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Reward of what has been well done: yaccha tokāya, tanayāya, sam yoḥ: sam = pāparūpodravaṇam śantim, pacification of violence of the nature of sin; yoḥ sukṛtotpāditam sukham, happiness produced by what is done well
