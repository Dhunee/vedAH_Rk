## English translation:

“If, young (of the gods), with the inconsiderateness common to men, we have ever committed any offence against you, make us free from the defects of earth efface entirely, **Agni** our offences.”

Free from the defects of earth: aditer anāgān = bhumer anāgasaḥ, pāparahitān, sins of the earth, or against the earth
