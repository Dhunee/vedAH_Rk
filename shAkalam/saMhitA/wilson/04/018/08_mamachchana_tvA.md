## English translation:

“**Vāmadeva** speaks: exulting one youthful mother brought you forth; exulting, Kuṣavā swallowed you; exulting, the waters gave delight to the infant; **Indra**, exulting, rose up by his strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kuṣavā = a **rākṣasi**, whom Indra, although at first swalled by her, drove out of the lying-in chamber
