## English translation:

“These (rivers) flew murmuring as if, being filled with water, they were uttering sounds (of joy); ask them what is this they say; what is the encompassing cloud that the waters break through?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ask them what is this they say: i.e., they are proclaiming the greatness of **Indra**, by which, and not by their own efforts, they have been extricated from the cloud
