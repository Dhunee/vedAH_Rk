## English translation:

“Deeming it disreputable (that he should be brought forth) in secret, his mother endowed (**Indra**) with (extraordinary) vigour; therefore, as soon as born he sprung up of his own accord, invested with splendour, and filled both heaven and earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In secret: in the privacy of the lying-in chamber, unworthy of so great a divinity
