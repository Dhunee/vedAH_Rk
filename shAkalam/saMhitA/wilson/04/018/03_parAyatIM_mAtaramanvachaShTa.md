## English translation:

“He, (**Indra**), has asserted (that it will) cause the death of my mother; let me not proceed by the usual way, but proceed quickly, according (to my will); in the dwelling of **Tvaṣṭā** Indra drank the costly **Soma** from the vessels of the offerers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Vāmadeva** vindicates his own wilfulness by the example of Indra, who came to Tvaṣṭā's house uninvited, and, by force, drank the Soma prepared for other gods; tvaṣṭā havaputro vīndram somamāharat (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.4.12)
