## English translation:

“With you, **Soma**, for his ally, **Indra** has quickly taken off by force the wheel of the chariot of the sun, abiding above with the vast and stationary (firmament); the everywhere going wheel (of the car) of the great oppressor has been taken away.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Maho druho = prabhutasya drogdhuḥ, of the very mighty oppresor or tyrant, alluding probably to his heat
