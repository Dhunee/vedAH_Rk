## English translation:

“**Indra**, you have made these **Dasyus** devoid of all (good qualities); you have made the races without rites abject; may you, (**Soma** and Indra), repel (and) destroy (your) enemies; accept (our) homage for their destruction.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You have made the servile races abject: **viśa** dāsīr akṛṇora **praśastāḥ**: **dāsiḥ** as the adjective of **viśaḥ**, **prajāḥ**, people, men, is explained: karmahīnāḥ, having no special or religiously instrumental tuted rites or functions;

Apraśastāḥ = garhitāḥ, reviled, vile
