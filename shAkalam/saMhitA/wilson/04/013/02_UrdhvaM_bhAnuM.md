## English translation:

“The divine **Savitā** diffuses his light on high, dispersing the dew, and like a vigorous (bull) ardent for the cow; then **Varuṇa**, and **Mitra**, and other (divinities), hasten to (fulfil) their offices when they elevate the sun in the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hasten to fill their offices: yat sūryam divy ārohanti; yad raśmayaḥ sūryasya ārohaṇam kārayanti, when the rays of light cause the ascent of the sun
