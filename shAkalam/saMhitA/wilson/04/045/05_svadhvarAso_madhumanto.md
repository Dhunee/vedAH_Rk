## English translation:

“The ssacred fires, the instrumental uments of holy sacrifice the conveyers of libations, praise the associated **Aśvins** at the break of day, when the observant (priest) the conductor of the rite, with washed **hands** has expressed by the (grinding) stones the sweet-flavoured **Soma** juice.”
