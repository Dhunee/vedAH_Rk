## English translation:

“The sun rises; your chariot, (**Aśvins**), traversing (the regions), is associated with the divine (orb) on the summit (of the eastern mountain in it are three analogous kinds of food, and the leather vessel of the sweet **Soma** juice appears as the fourth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three analogous kinds of food: pṛkṣāso mithunā **trayaḥ**: mithunā = twins, a pair; it is used for a number of analogous or connected objects, as **mātā** **pitā** putrastadeva mithunam, mother, father, son, constitute a twin or pair; the three sorts of food are said to be aśanam, pānam, **khādaḥ**
