## English translation:

“When quickly, with rapid (radiance), he has carried off his food, the mighty **Agni** makes (himself) the fleet messenger (of the worshipper); consuming (the fuel), he allies himself with the force of the wind, and as (a horseman) urges his fast steed, so the rapid going Agni, invigorates and urges (his flames).”
