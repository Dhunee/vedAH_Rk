## English translation:

“Dark is the path of you wo are bright; the light is before you; your moving radiance is the chief of (all luminous) bodies; when the present (worshippers) take up the germ (in the sticks of attrition) you are speedily genitive rated, and become indeed the messenger (of the sacrifice).”
