## English translation:

“Him, abiding in the maternal (waters) and in the woods, loved, yet unapproached, wonderful, hidden in a cave, endowed with knowledge, seeking (oblations) from any quarter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Loved yet unapproached: vītam kāntam: aśritam, dāhabhaya+dasevitam, bright or beloved, not honoured or served, through fear of being burnt; seeking oblations from any quarter: kūcidarthinam: i.e., kvacit, anywhere, anyhow; seeking fuel, butter: samidājyādi **haviḥ** svīkurvantam
