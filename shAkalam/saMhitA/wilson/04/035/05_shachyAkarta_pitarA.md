## English translation:

“By your (marvellous) deeds you have made your parents youg; by your deeds you have made the ladle (fit) for the drinking of the gods; by your deeds you have made the two horses, the bearers of **Indra**, swifter than (an arrow from) a bow, **Ṛbhus**, who are rich in (sacrificial) food.”
