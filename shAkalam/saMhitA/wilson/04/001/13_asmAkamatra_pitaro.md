## English translation:

“In this world, our mortal forefathers departed after instrumental tuting the sacred rite, when, calling upon the dawn, they extricated the milk-yielding kine, concealed among the rocks in the darkness (of the cave).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Our mortal forefathers: the **aṅgirasas**; the reference is to the origin of fire-worship by **Aṅgiras** and his followers
