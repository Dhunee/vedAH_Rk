## English translation:

“Radiance has first proceeded to you, (**Agni**), who are glorified by praise, in the womb of the water, in the nest of the rain-cloud; the seven attached (priests) have engendered (praise) to the showerer (of benefits), who desirable, ever young, embodied, and resplendent.”
