## English translation:

“May **Agni** be the **Aditi** of all those in whom sacrifice is offered; may he be the guest of all men; receiving the (sacrificial) food of the devout may he to whom all is known, be the bestower of felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 33.16; may Agni be the Aditi: may he be the cherisher of the gods as if he were Aditi, their mother; or, Aditi may mean the earth, which is their stay or support;

Aditi = without a defect, gasyo khaṇḍanam **nāsa** adian, not mean or base; receiving the sacrificial food: devānām ava avriṇanaḥ = participating in the sacrificial food of the worshippers; or, delivering oblations offered to the gods, i.e., through fire
