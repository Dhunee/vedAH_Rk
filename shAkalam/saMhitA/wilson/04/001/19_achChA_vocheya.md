## English translation:

“May I glorify the present radiant **Agni**, the invoker (of the gods), the supporter of the universe, most deserving of adoration, without milking the pure udder (of the cow), without the purified food of the **Soma** offered in libation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Without the purified food: i.e., no offering is made to Agni on the occasion; praise alone is addressed to him
