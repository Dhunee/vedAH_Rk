## English translation:

“Rending the rocks, they worshipped (**Agni**), and other (sages) taught everywhere their (acts); unprovided with the means of (extricating) the cattle, they glorified the author of success, whence they found the light, and were thus enabled (to worship him) with holy ceremonies.”
