## English translation:

“Friendly and beautiful (**Agni**), bring your friend (Varruṇa) to our presence, as two strong horses convey the swift chariot along the road to its goal; you receive, Agni, the gratifying (oblation) together with **Varuṇa**, and with the all-illuminig **Maruts**; grant, brilliant Agni, happiness to our sons and grandsons; grant, beautiful Agni, happiness to ourselves.”
