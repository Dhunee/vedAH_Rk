## English translation:

“They first have comprehended the name of the kine, knowing the thrice seven excellent (forms) or the maternal (rhythm); then they glorified the conscious dawns and the purple dawn appeared with the radiance of the sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Comprehended the name of the kine: te manvata prathamam **nāma** dhenoḥ: dhenoḥ = vāk, speech and with nāma, stutisādhakam śabdamātram, mere sound as the means of praise; the passage may also refer to the ancient nominative nclature of cattle, as uttered by the **Aṅgirasas**: ehi **surabhi**, **guggulu**, gandhini; thrice seven: twenty one metres of the **vedas**
