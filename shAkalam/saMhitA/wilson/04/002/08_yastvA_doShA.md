## English translation:

“Preserve from sin the liberal sacrificer who glorifies you morning and evening, and presenting oblations, does what is acceptable to you in his own abode, like a horse with golden caparisons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aśvo na sve dame hemyāvān = suvarṇanirmita kakṣyāvān, having a girth made of gold, the epithet is applied to the horse, though separated by sve dame, in his own house
