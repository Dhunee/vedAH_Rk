## English translation:

“I celebrate the ruddy, food-bestowing, water- shedding, and swifter-than-thought-going, steeds of him who is the truth; harnessing the brilliant pair (to your chariot), you pass between the deities of whom you are, and human worshippers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You pass between the deities: antarīyase yuṣmāṃśca devān **viśa** ā ca martān, you go between, you the gods, and men; you is specified from **Agni** being a divinity; he goes to men to receive oblation, and to the gods, of whom he is one, to bear it to them
