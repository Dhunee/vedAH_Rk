## English translation:

“He who has beenplaced immortal among the mortals, the observer of truth, a deity triumphant among gods, the invoker of the gods, the most diligent sacrificer, **Agni**; he has been plural ced (upon the altar) to lighten (the ceremony) by his (lustre), and for the elevation of the worshipper, through oblations (in heaven).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Amont the mortal: or, among mortal organs of sense, Agni being that of speech: agnir-vāg bhūtvā mukham prāviśat
