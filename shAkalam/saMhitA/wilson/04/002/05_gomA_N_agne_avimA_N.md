## English translation:

“May the sacrifice, **Agni**, be productive of cows, of sheep, of horses, and celebrated by your worshipper, aided by the priests, be ever uninterrupted; may it, mighty Agni, be productive of food and progeny, long continued, affluent, wide based, and held in full assembly.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e. sabhāvān, in the presence of spectators upadraṣṭi sabhārūpayuktaḥ
