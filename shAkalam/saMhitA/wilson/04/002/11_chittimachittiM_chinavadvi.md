## English translation:

“May the wise **Agni** discriminate between virtue and vice between (virtuous and wicked) men, as a (groom distinguishes between) the strong and weak backs (of horses); enrich us with wealth accompanied by virtuous offspring; be bountiful to the liberal giver; shun him who gives not.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Cittim acittim cinavadvi **vidvān**, may the sage (Agni) distinguish that which is to be known, cittim jñātavyam puṇyam or virtue, and acittim acetanīyam not to be thought of, or pāpam sin; cittim and acittim are explained by jñānam and ajñānam, knowledge and ignorance; martān, mortals or men, has no epithets and are supplied: the comparison runs: pṛṣṭheva vitā vṛjinā ca, like backs bright, (kāntāni) and ill-bearing (durvahāṇi); for the horses and the groom, (aśvapāla)
