## English translation:

“May we seven priests first in order engender from the material drawn the worshippers of the creator (**Agni**); may we **Aṅgirasas** be the sons of heaven, and, radiant, divide the wealth-continuing mountain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May we, Aṅgirasas, be the sons of heaven: divasputrā aṅgiraso bhavena, or, may we, the sons of heaven be Aṅgirasas; or, bhūtimantaḥ, possessed of superior power. The Aṅgirasas are the sons of A-**ditya**, aṅgirasām ādityaputratvam āmnāgyate; the text is: tasya yad retaḥ prathamam udadipyata tad asau ādityo abhavat, ityupakramya ye **aṅgārā** asanste aṅgiraso abhavan, that which was his seed was first manifested as **Āditya**, thence, in succession, those which were the cinders became the Aṅgirasas; wealth-containing mountain: ādrim rujema dhaninam, may allude to the rock in which the cows were hidden; or, **adri** may be rendered cloud (**megha**), by the disruption of which rain is made to fall
