## English translation:

“All the high plural ces, and the many low paces, the heaven and the earth, trembled (through fear) of the mighty (**Indra**) at his birth; the strong (Indra) cherishes the parents of the moving (Sun), and the winds, like men, make a noise in their peregrination.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parents of the moving sun: mātarā **bharati** goḥ: goḥ = gantuḥ sūryasya
