## English translation:

“Since the great and mighty **Indra** is propitiated by our (oblations), since he desires (them) from us, may he, the possessor of opulence, who comes wielding the thunderbolt of his strength, accept the (sacrificial) food, the hymn, the **Soma** libation, and the prayers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Food, hymn, soma and prayhers: an allusion to the fourfold forms of offering worship, **Brahmā**, **Stoma**, Soma and **Uktha**: the first is the cakes steeped in butter-- offerings or obaltions; the second, the praise that is recited aloud; the third, the libation of the Soma; and the fourth, the praise or prayer that is repeated silently or in a lower tone not chanted or sung\].
