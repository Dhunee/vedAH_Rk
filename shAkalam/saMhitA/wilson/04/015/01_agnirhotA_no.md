## English translation:

“**Agni**, the invoker (of the gods), like a horse (that bears a burden), is brought to our sacrifice; a deity adorable among deities.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Is brought to our sacrifice: pariṇīyate = implies a formal ceremonial, the bringing of the fire taken from the household fire wherewith to light the sacrificial fire; **vāji** san = a horse, i.e., whom they load as a horse bringing a load; Agni is brought to become the bearer of the oblation, havir **vāhanaḥ** (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.5)
