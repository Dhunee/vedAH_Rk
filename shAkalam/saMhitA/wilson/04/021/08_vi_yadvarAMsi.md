## English translation:

“Inasmuch as he has opened the doors of the cloud, and has supplied the rapid courses of the waters with (additional) torrents, so when the pious have recourse to **Indra** for food, he finds (it) in the haunt of the **Gaura** and **Gavaya**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He finds it in the haunt of Gaura and Gavaya: vidat gaurasya gavayasya gohe: vidat here has no government;

Goha = **gṛha**, a dwelling; Gaura and Gavaya are two species of **mṛga**, deer or any wild animal; they are perhaps bos gavaus or gavaus frontalis and bibos gaurus or bos cavifrons; the purport of the phrase is that Indra obtains those two animals tau dvau **paśu** labhate, either for himself as sacrificial flesh, or for his worshippers, some of whom, at least, even now, would not object to eat the flesh of the wild oxen
