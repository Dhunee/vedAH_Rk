## English translation:

“Thus (glorified), **Indra**, who is faithful (to his word), the lord of wealth, the slayer of **Vṛtra**, bestows rihes on man; so you, the praised of many, give us riches for our pious acts, that I may eat of your divine food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bestow riches on man: varivaḥ pūrave kaḥ = manuṣyāya dhanam **karoti**; or, it may be a reference to a descendant of **Puru**
