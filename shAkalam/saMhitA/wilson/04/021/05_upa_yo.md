## English translation:

“Let the invoking priest bring to our dwellings that (**Indra**) who, firmly fixing the (world) returns food for (sacrificial food), and (utters) a voice enjoining (men) to worship; he who is to be propitiated by praises, who is adored by many.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Utters a voice enjoining men to worship: vācam janayam yajudhyai = the speech of Indra is the thunder
