## English translation:

“True it is that this might of the son of the protector of the world, the showerer (of benefits), affects for his advantage the offerer of praise; it (prevails) in the secret (thoughts) of the worshipper, and in his dwelling, for (the accomplishment of his) pious acts, (the attainment of his) desires, and his delight.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The protector of the world: bhārvara = patronymic of Bhārvara, which means jagadbhartā, the protector of the world, or, **Prajāpati**; in the secret thoughts: the text has **guhā** pra; this is expanded into: guhārūpa hṛdaye **prabhavati**, the strength,balam, of **Indra**, prevails or presides over the heart, in the nature of secrecy or mystery; the purport of the entire verse is that the might of Indra always protects his worshipper, Indrasya balam **sarvadā** vajamānam pālayati
