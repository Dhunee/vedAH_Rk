## English translation:

“Divine Heaven and Earth, I praise you together with **Ahirbudhnya** for those (good things that are) desired, as those desirous of acquiring (riches) praise the ocean on traversing it (in which) the sounding rivers disappear.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As those desirous: **samudram** na sañcaraṇe saniṣyavaḥ = dhanānām sambhaktum iccantaḥ samudramadhyagamanāya samudram yathā stuvanti, as those wishing to possess riches for the sake of going through the midst of the ocean praise the ocean; gharmasvara so nadyo apavran = dīptadhvanayho nadyo apavṛnvantiti **parokṣa** iva, referring this to the deities, the explanation is: may they, Heaven and Earth, cherish or replenish the rivers
