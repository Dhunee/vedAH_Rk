## English translation:

“Which of you, **Vasus**, is a defender? Which is a protector? Heaven and earth and **Aditi** preserve us; defend us, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, from the strong man; who is it, gods, that offers you wealth at the sacrifice?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aditi: dyāvābhūmi adite trāsīthām naḥ: adite, undivided, indivisible, may be an epithet of heaven and earth; who is it, gods, that offer you: ko vo adhvare arivo dhāti **devāḥ** = which of you gods bestows wealth at the sacrifice?
