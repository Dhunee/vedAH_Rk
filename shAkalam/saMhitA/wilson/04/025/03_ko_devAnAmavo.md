## English translation:

“Who solicits today the protection of the gods? who glorifies the **Ādityas**, **Aditi**, light? of whose effused libation to the **Aśvins**, **Indra**, **Agni**, drink at will propitiated by his praise?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Light: jyotir; this is explained as water, jyotir udakam
