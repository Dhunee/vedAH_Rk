## English translation:

“This hero, **Indra**, the prompt discomfiter (of foes), who is to be approached with homage, grants special maturity to the presenter of the libation; he is not the kinsman, nor friend, nor relative, of him who offers no libation (to him); he is difficult of access, and the punisher of him who repeats not (his) praise.”
