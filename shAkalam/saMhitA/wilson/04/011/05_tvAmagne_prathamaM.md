## English translation:

“Immortal **Agni**, devout mortals worship with holy rites you the first deity (of the gods), whose tongue exhilarates (them), the dissipator of sin, the humiliator (of the demons) the lord of the mansion, the unperplexed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whose tongues exhilarate them: by taking as their mouth the oblation; the humiliator of demons: damanūnasam = rākṣasam damanakareṇa mānasopetam, being intent on destroying the **rākṣasas**, having a mind for taming, or a tamed or humble mind, a liberal or a domestic mind
