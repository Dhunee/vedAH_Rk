## English translation:

“The offerings (to the gods) are engendered, **Agni**, of you; from you (proceed) praises; from you effective prayers; from you come a vigorous frame and wealth to man who worships with sincerity and offers oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The offerings to the gods: **kāvyā** = kāvyāni, acts in connection with fire, such as bringing the deities conveying oblations; or, it may mean the functions of the **adhvaryu**; or it may refer to the kāvyā, or offerings to the **pitṛs** or manes
