## English translation:

“Powerful **Agni**, your auspicious radiance shines upon the proximity of the sun (by day); your bright and visible (lustre) is conspicuous by night, as the bland and plural asing food (of sacrifice, the oblation) becomes manifest in your form.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By day, by night: i.e., oblations are to be offered with fire both morning and evening
