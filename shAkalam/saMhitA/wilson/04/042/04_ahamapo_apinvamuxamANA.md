## English translation:

“I have distributed the moisture-shedding waters; I have upheld the sky as the abode of the water; by the water I have become the preserver of the water, the son of **Aditi**, illustrating the threefold elementary space.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As the abode of the water: sadane ṛtasya may imply, for the plural ce or sphere of the sun, the word ṛta is used for **udaka** or **āditya**; illustrating the three-fold elementary space: i.e., for me the creator has made the **three worlds**, madartham eva kṣityādilokatrayam akārśit **parameśvaraḥ**; or, simply, the earth with three ore-elements, tridhātu
