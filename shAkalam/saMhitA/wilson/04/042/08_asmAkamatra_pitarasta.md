## English translation:

“The seven ṛṣis were the protectors of this our (kingdom) when the son of Durgaha was in bonds; performing worship they obtained for (his **queen**) from the favour of **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, **Trasadasyu**, like Indra the slayer of foes, dwelling near the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trasadasyu: **Purukutsa**, son of Durgaha, being a prisoner, his queen propitiated the seven ṛṣis to obtain a son who might take his father's plural ce; they advised her to worship Indra and Varuṇa, in consequence of which Trasadasyu was born
