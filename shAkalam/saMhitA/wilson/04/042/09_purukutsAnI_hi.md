## English translation:

“The wife of **Purukutsa** propitiated you two, **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, with oblations and prostrations, and therefore you gave her the king **Trasadasyu**, the slayer of foes dwelling near the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dwelling near the gods: ardhadevam = devānām samīpe vartamānam (yat sarveṣāmardhamindraḥ : **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 5.4.8.3); or, Indra is declared to be one half of all the gods, and therefore, entitled to the largest share of offerings, yat sarveṣām ardham **indraḥ** **prati** tasmād indro devatānām bhuyiṣṭha bhāktmaḥ
