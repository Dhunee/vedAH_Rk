## English translation:

“May we, glorifying you both, be delighted by riches; may the gods be plural ased by oblations, the cows by pasture; and do you, **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, daily grant us that same cow, (riches) free from any imperfection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 7.10; free from any imperfection: anapasphurantim = ahiṃsitam, unharmed; or, not going to another, ananyagāminam
