## English translation:

“Twofold is my empire, that of the whole **kṣatriya** race, and all the immortals are ours; the gods associate me with the acts of **Varuṇa**; I rule over (those) of the proximate form of man.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Twofold is my empire: mama **dvitā** rāṣṭram kṣatriyasya viśvayoḥ; an allusion to the military and regal order; all the immortals are ours: viśve **amṛtā** yathā naḥ, therefore he is king also over **svarga**; the gods associate me with the acts of **Varuna**: kratum sacante varuṇasya **devā** rājāmi kṛṣṭer upamasya vavreḥ: vavreḥ = **rūpa**, form;

Rājāmi = rājatiraiśvarya karmā
