## English translation:

“Whom men call after in battles, as after a thief carrying off a garment, or as (after) a hungry hawk pouncing (upon his prey); they call after him, hastening to obtain food, or a herd of cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They call after him: śravascācchā paśumacca yūtham = **annam** kīrttim vā paśumad yūtham ca **acchā** abhilakṣya gacchantam enam anukrośanti, they call after him, that is Dadhikrā, going, having in view either food or fame, or a herd consisting of cattle
