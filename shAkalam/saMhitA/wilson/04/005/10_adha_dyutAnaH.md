## English translation:

“Then, radiant in association with the parents, (heaven and earth), he is awakened (to drink) the agreeable secretion of the cow, and the tongue of the assiduous (performer of holy rites), the resplendent showerer (of benefits), approaching the excellent station of the maternal (cow), seeks to drink the milk.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Assiduous performer: the text has only prayatasya; this is amplified into: āhavanīyādi rupeṇa niyatasya vaiśvānarasya, of **vaiśvānara** active in the form of the **āhavanīya** fire
