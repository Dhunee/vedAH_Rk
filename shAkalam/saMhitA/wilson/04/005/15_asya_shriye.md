## English translation:

“For the prosperity of this (instrumental tutor of the rite), the host (of the flames) of the kindled (**Agni**), the showerer (of benefits), the giver of dwellings, has blazed in the hall (of sacrifice); clothed in radiance, beautiful in semblance, and glorified by many, he shines like a man with opulence.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kṣitir narāya, like a **rājā**; or, the like, with wealth of cattle and treasure, rāyāśvādinā dhanena rājādiriva
