## English translation:

“(Men are) not satisfied by unproductive, frivolous, inconclusive, scanty speech; then what, **Agni**, do they here say to you? devoid of the implements (of worship), let them suffer from distress.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e., if they pretend to worship Agni without the oblation, and other materials of a burnt offering, they cannot expect his favour
