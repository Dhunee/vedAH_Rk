## English translation:

“May **Agni**, filling both (the middling and most excellent condition), bright shining, of manifold vigour, the showerer of (benefits), the possessor of affluence, (who comprehends), by (his) wisdom the mysterious sacred hymn, as (they track) the footsteps of a (missing) cow, reveal (the sense) to me.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Filling both: dvibarha = dvayor madhyamottamayoḥ sthānayoḥ parivṛḍhaḥ; who comprehends: **sāma** **mahi** padam na goḥ apagūḷham vividvān agnir mahyam predu vocan manīṣām: manīṣām, is connected with sāma and is explained as jñātavyam, what is to be known; apagūḷham atyantarahasyam; this is attached to padam
