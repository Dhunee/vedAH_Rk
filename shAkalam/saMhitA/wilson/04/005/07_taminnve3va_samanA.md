## English translation:

“May our (self) purifying praise, suited to his glory, and accompanied by worship, quickly attain to that omniform (**Vaiśvānara**) whose swift-ascending brilliant (orb) is stationed on the east of the earth, to mount, like the sun, above this immoveable heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viaśvānara: the sun; or, **Agni** as lightning, or **Āditya**; above immoveable heaven: sasasya **carman** **adhi** pṛśneḥ = svapata iva niścalasya dyulokasya upari caranāya, for going above the immoveable heaven like the sun
