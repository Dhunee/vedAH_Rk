## English translation:

“Wise **Indra**, I praise your brown (horses); bestower of kine, (who are) not regardless (of your worshippers); with those two steeds terrify not our cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Not regardless of your worshippers: he **napāt** na pātayitāḥ stotṛn avināśayitaḥ kintu pālayitaḥ itaryarthaḥ, oḥ you, not casting down, not injuring or destroying, those who praise, that is, cherishing them
