“The flowing (stream) has sprinkled your steeds with moisture; the radiant horses (like) birds (in swiftness) pass on, bright with lustre; well known as that quick-moving chariot, whereby you became the lords of **Sūrya**.”

The flowing stream: **sindhu**, this may mean here, either water or a cloud
