## English translation:

“The (worshipper) subjecting ṛta (to his will) verily enjoys ṛta; the strength ṛta is (developed) with speed, and is desirous of (possessing) water; to ṛta belong the wide and profound heaven and earth; supreme kine, they yield their milk to ṛta.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Desirous of possessing water: ṛtasya śuṣmas turayā u gavyuḥ = śuṣmo balam tūrayās tūrṇam gavyuḥ u carthe jalakāmaśca **bhavati**
