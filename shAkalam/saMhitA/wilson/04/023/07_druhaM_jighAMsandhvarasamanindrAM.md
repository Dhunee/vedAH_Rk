## English translation:

“Resolving to kil the oppressing, malevolent (**rākṣasi**), not acknowledging **Indra**, he sharpened his sharp weapons for (her) destruction, and the fierce (Indra) the canceller of debts, has kept afar the unknown dawns in which the debts (are to be paid).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Resolving to kill: jighāṃsan druham dhavarasam anindram: the implied rākṣasi is thought to mean death, the debt of nature, the payment of what Indra's favour delays by prolonging life
