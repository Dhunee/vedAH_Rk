## English translation:

“Many are the stable, sustaining, delightful forms of the embodied ṛta; the ṛta are (the pious) expectant of food; by ṛta have the kine entered into the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e., as presents made to the officiating priests; the phrase may also mean, the rays of light have entered into the water, **gāva** ṛtam āviveśuḥ raśmayā udakam āiveśuḥ
