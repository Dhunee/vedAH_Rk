## English translation:

“Thereupon some verily worship the powerful (**Indra**); thereupon one man prepares the buttered cake that he may offer it to (Indra); thereupon the offerer of the **Soma** he distinguishes from him who presents no libation; thereupon some one rejoices to worship the showerer (of benefits).”
