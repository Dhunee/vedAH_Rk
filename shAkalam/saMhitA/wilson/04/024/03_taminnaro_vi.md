## English translation:

“Men verily call upon him in battle; the (devout) inflicters of austerity upon their person ns constitute him their preserver; when both (the worshipper and the priest) approach together the bountiful **Indra**, men (succeed) in (obtaining) the gift of sons and grandsons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Inflicters of austerity: ririkvāṃsas **tanaḥ** = svakīyāni śarīrāṇi tapasā recayanto yajamānāḥ, worshippers emaciating their own bodies by penance
