## English translation:

“A man has realized a small price for an article of great value, and again coming (to the buyer he says) this has not been sold; I require the full price; but he does not recover a small price by a large (equivalent); whether helpless or clever they adhere to their bargain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A man has realized: bhūyasā vasnam acarat kanīyas = liṭ, by much a man acquires a little, wealth or value; kaścid paṇyena dravyeṇa alpataram mūlyam prāpnoti: kaścit is understood to be the vendor; one (a vendor) who takes a small price for valuable goods, comes afterwards to the buyer, and says, this has not been sold by me, and, so saying, he requires the balance of the price; but he, the vendor, does not recover the full price, nor does he get back the article; according to the bargain between them it may not be otherwise; the sale has taken plural ce, and if the bargain has been kept, then it has only to be considered that such is the object of the price, and that is the conclusion: a baragin has been made, and the (stipulated) price given; therefore, in the first plural ce, an agreement is to be made by me: so reflecting, **Vāmadeva**, having by much praise got **Indra** into his possession or subjugation, purposes to make a bargain when about to dispose of him, as in the next verse
