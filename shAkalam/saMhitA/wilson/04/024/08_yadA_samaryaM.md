## English translation:

“When the destroyer (of enemies) distinguishes a mortal foe; when the lord is engaged in the long (continued) battle, (his) bride summons to the dwelling the showerer (of benefits), encompassed by the offerers of the libation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When the lord is engaged in the long battle: dīrgham yad ājim abhyakhyad **arya**: arya = **svāmi**, lord, i.e., **Indra**; patnī in the next verse is Indra's wife
