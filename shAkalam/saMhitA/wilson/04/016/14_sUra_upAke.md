## English translation:

“While having (your) person n in the proximity of the sun, your form becomes redolent of ambrosia, and you are like the deer-like elephant, consuming the strength (of the strong), and are like a terrible lion when wielding your weapons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the deer-like elephant: mṛgo na **hasti** = **gaja** **viśeṣa**; **mṛga** iva = a sort of elephant like a deer
