## English translation:

“Like a sage (knowing) what is hidden, and fulfilling sacred rites, so the showerer (of benefits), quaffing copiously the effused (libation), exults (in the draught), and he genitive rates the seven efficient (rays) from heaven, which, being glorified, have made (manifest) the objects of (human) perception by day.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven efficient rays: ajījanat sapta kārūn ahnā ciccakrur **vayunā** gṛṇantaḥ
