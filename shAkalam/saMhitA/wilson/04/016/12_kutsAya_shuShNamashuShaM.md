## English translation:

“For **Kutsa**, you have slain the unhappy **Śuṣṇa** and in the forepart of the day, attended by thousands (you have slain) **Kuyava** with the thunderbolt; you have swiftly destroyed the **Dasyus**, and you have cut them to pieces in the battle, with the wheel (of the chariot of) the sun.”
