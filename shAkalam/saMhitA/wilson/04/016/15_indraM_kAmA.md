## English translation:

“Relying (upon **Indra**) for protection, and desirous of riches, (pious men) repair to him soliciting his presence in the sacrifice, as if in the battle, asking for food, celebrating his praise with hymns, for he is the refuge (of his worshippers), and resembles the grateful and lovely (goddess) of nutrition.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e. goddess **Lakṣmī**
