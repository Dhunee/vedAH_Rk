## English translation:

“You have subjugated Pipru and the mighty **Mṛgayā** for the sake of Ṛjiṣvan, the son of Vidathin, you have slain the fifty thousand **Kṛṣṇas**; and, as old age (destroys) life, you have demolished the cities (of **Śambara**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mṛgayā = name of an **asura**;

Vidathin = a **rājā**; fifty thousand Kṛṣṇas = **rākṣasas** of a black colour, kṛṣṇavarṇāni rākṣasāṃsi
