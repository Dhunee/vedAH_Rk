## English translation:

“**Maghavan**, who are honoured by men, you have repaired to the presence of the sage for (the sake of) bestowing (upon him) wealth, and when soliciting (you) in his need (for aid); defending (him) with your protection, the guileful, impious **Dasyu** has been destroyed in the contest for the spoil.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sage: the text has kavim, usually rendered as **krānta**-darśi, the seer of the past; but, here it is a synonym of **Kutsa**, as in the next verse
