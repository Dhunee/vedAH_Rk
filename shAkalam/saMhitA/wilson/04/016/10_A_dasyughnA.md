## English translation:

“With a mind resolved on killing the **Dasyu**, you came (to his dwelling), and **Kutsa** was eager for your friendship; now have you two alighted in his, (**Indra**'s), habitation, and being entirely similar in form the truthful woman has been perplexed (to discriminate between you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kutsa: a **rājaṛṣi**, the son of **Ruru**, also a royal saint; Kutsa is the author of several **sūktas** (RV 1.010), termed as the son of **Aṅgiras**; there is also a legendary Kutsa, son of **Arjuna**; truthful woman has been perplexed: after destroying the enemies of Kutsa, Indra conveyed him to his palace, where **Śaci**, the wife of Indra, could not tell who her husband was, since both were exactly alike
