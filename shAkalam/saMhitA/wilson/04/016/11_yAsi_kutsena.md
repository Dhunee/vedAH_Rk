## English translation:

“You go with **Kutsa** in the same chariot, determined to defend him; (you) who are the tormentor (of foes), the lord of horses (of the speech) of the wind; on the same day wherein, yoking (to the car) the straight-going steeds, as if to receive food, the sage (Kutsa) has been enabled to cross over (the sea) of calamity.”
