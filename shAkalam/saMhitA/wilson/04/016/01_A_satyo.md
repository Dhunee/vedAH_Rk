## English translation:

“May the truthful **Maghavan** the accepter of the spiritless **Soma**, come to us; may his horses hasten to us; to him we offer this sacrifice, the very potent beverage; may he grant the fulfilment of our desires.”

Spiritless soma: ṛjīṣin = from ṛjīṣa, vigata **sāraḥ** **somaḥ**, the Soma of which the essence is gone
