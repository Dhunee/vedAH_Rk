## English translation:

“Sharp is his path, and his vast body shines like a horse champing fodder with his mouth, darting forth his tongue like a hatchet, and burning timber to **ashes**, like a goldsmith who fuses (metal).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a goldsmith: dravir na drāvayati **dāru** dhakṣat = as a melter causes to melt, he burns the timber; yathā **svarṇakāraḥ** svarṇādikam drāvayati tathāgnir vanam bhasmasāt **karoti**, as a goldsmith fuses gold and the res, so **Agni** reduces the wood to ashes; this may imply something more than mere fusion of metals; the alchemical calcining or permutation of the metals would be more akin to the burning of timber, or reducing the metals to asheṣ
