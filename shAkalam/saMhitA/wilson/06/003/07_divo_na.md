## English translation:

“Of whom a sound is heard when scattering his rays like (that) of the sun; the brilliant showerer (of benefits) clamours among the (burning) plural nts; he who, moving not with a shifting, variable motion, but, humbling (our foes), fills the well-wedded earth and heaven with wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Fills the well-wedded: ā **rodasī** vasunā supātnī, śobhanapatikā **dyāvā** pṛthivyau dhanena pūrayati = he fills with wealth heaven and earth, both having a brilliant husband or lord; may be a reference to **Agni** or **Indra**
