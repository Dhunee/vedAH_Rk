## English translation:

“He casts (afar his flames) as an archer (his arrows), and sharpens when about to dart his radiance, as (a warrior whets) the edge of his metal (weapons), he who, variously moving, passes through the night, like the light-falling foot of a bird perched upon a tree.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The edge of his metal: ayaso na dhārām
