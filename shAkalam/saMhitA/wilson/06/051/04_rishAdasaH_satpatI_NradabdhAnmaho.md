## English translation:

“The scatterers of the malevolent, the defenders of the virtuous, the irresistible, the mighty lords, the donors of good dwellings, ever young, very powerful, omnipresent, leader of heaven, the sons of **Āditya**; I have recourse to **Aditi**, who is gratified by mine adoration.”
