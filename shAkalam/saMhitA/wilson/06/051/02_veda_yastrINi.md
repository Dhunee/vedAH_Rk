## English translation:

“He who knows the three cognizable (worlds); the sage (who knows) the mysterious birth of the divinities (abiding in them); he who is beholding the good and evil acts of mortals, he, the sun, the lord, makes manifest their intentions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The divinities abiding in them: Of the **Vasus** on earth, the **Rudras** in the firmament, the **Ādityas** in heaven. Vasus are the 'earthly riches'; the other divinities are 'instrumental uments' in the process of making wealth
