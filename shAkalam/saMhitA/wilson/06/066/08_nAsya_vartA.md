## English translation:

“There is no propeller, no obstructer, of him, whom, **Maruts**, you protect in battle; he whom (you prosper) with sons, grandsons, cattle, and water, is in war the despoiler of the herds of his ardent (foes).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Despoiler of the herds: sa vrajam dartā pārye adha dyoḥ = sa gavām saṅgham dārayitā saṅgrāme dyoḥ;

Dyoḥ = vijigiṣor vā śatroḥ, of one desirous to overcome, or an enemy
