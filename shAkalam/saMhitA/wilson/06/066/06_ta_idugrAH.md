## English translation:

“THose fierce and powerfully arrayed (**Maruts**) unite by their strength the two beautiful (regions) heaven and earth; in them, the self-radiant, heaven and earth abide; the obstruction (of light) dwells not in those mighty ones.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Unite by their strength: by the rain, which may be said to form a bond of union between heaven and earth
