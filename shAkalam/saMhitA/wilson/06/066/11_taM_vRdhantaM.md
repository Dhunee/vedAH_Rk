## English translation:

“I worship with oblations that exalted company of the **Maruts**, the progeny of **Rudra**, armed with shining lances; the pure and earnest praises of the devout (adorer) are emulous in the invigoration (of the Maruts), as the clouds (vie in the emission of the rain).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The pure and earnest praises: **divaḥ** śardhāya śucayo maniṣā girayo nāpa **ugrā** aspṛdhran = of heaven of the strength pure praises mountains like waters fierce have vied;

Divaḥ = stotuḥ, of the praiser or worshipper;

Śardhāya = mārutāya, for the strength of the Maruts;

**Giri** = **megha**, a cloud
