## English translation:

“They who approach not to men any conveyance, being already in their hearts, purifying their defects; when brilliant they supply their milk (the rain) for the gratification (of their worshippers); they are watering the earth (manifesting their collective); from with splendour.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Being already in their hearts: the **Maruts** are regarded as identical wit the **Prāṇāḥ**, vital airs
