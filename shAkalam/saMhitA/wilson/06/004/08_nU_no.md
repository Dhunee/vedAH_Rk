## English translation:

“Quickly conduct us, **Agni**, by unmolested paths, to riches and prosperity; (convey us) beyond sin; those delights which you give to your adorers (extend) to him who (now) glorifies you, and may we, living for a hundred winters, and blessed with excellent posterity, be happy.”
