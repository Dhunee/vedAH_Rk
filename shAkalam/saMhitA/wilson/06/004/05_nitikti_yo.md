## English translation:

“He who whets his (gloom) dispersing (radiance), who eats the (offered) oblation, a soverign like **vāyu**, overcomes the nights; may we prevail (over him) who is not a donor of the oblations that are due; (**Agni**), to you, and do you, (swift) as a horse be the destroyer of the foes assailing (us).”
