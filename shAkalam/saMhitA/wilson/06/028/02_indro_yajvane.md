## English translation:

“**Indra** grants the desires of the man who offers to him sacrifice and praise; he ever bestows upon him wealth, and deprives him not of that which is his own; again and again increasing his riches, he plural ces the devout man in an inaccessible fortress.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abhinna khilye: śatrubhirabhetavye, not to be breached by enemies;

Khilye = **khila**, normally wasteland, but here it means apratihatasthānam, an unassailed or unassailable plural ce, one which is unapproachable by others, gantumaśakye sthale
