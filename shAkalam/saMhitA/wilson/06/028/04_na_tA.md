## English translation:

“Let not the dust-spurning (war) horse reach them nor let them fall in the way of sacrificial consecration let the cattle of the man who offers sacrifice wander about at large and without fear.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Not let them fall: na saṃskṛtatram abhyupayanti = viśasanādisaṃskādisaṃskāram nābhyupagacchantu, let them not go right to the consecration of immolation; as metonymy, perhaps the cows means their produce, milk and butter, which are constantly offered
