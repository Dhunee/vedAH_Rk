## English translation:

“May the cows be (for our) affluence; may **Indra** grant me cattle; may the cows yield the food of the first libation; these cows, oḥ men, are the Indra, the Indra whom I desire with heart and mins.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

These cows are the Indra: a remarkable person nation; the cows may be considered as Indra, as they nourish him by their milk and butter presented in sacrifices; **gāva** **bhayaḥ** = mahyam dhanam bhavantu, may they be to me affluence; the cows are perhaps **bhaga**, the deity of good fortune and riches
