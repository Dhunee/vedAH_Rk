## English translation:

“Do you, cows, give us nourisment; render the emaciated, the unlovely body the reverse; do you, whose lowing is auspicious, make my dwelling prosperous; great is the abundance that is attributed to you in religious assemblies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛhad vo **vaya** ucyate sabhāsu, great of you the food is said in assemblies; or, great is the food given to you in assemblies, it is given by all, sarvair dīyate ityarthaḥ
