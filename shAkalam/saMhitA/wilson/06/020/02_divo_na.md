## English translation:

“To you, **Indra**, as to the sun, all strength has verily been given by the gods; so that, drinker of the stale **Soma**, associated with **Viṣṇu**, you mightiest slay the hostile Ahi obstructing the waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Given by the gods: devebhiḥ = stotṛbhiḥ; stotraiḥ stuyamānā **devatā** **balavatī**, a deity becomes strong, being praised with praises; the hostile Ahi: ahim vṛtram = hantāram, **Vṛtra**, the destroyer Vṛtra
