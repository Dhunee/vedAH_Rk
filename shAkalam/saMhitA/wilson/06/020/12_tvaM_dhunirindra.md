## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, who make (your enemies) tremble, have caused the waters, detained by **Dhuni**, to flow like rushing rivers; so, hero, when, having crossed the ocean, you have reached the shore, you have brought over in safety **Turvaśa** and **Yadu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Samudram** atipraparṣi = samudram atikramya pratirṇo bhavasi = when you are crossed, having traversed the ocean, you have brought across Turvaśa and Yadu, both standing on the future shore, samudrapāre tiṣṭhantau apārayaḥ
