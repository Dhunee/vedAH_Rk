## English translation:

“The **Paṇis**, **Indra**, fled, with hundres (of **asuras**), from the sage, your worshipper (and ally) in battle; neither did e, (Indra), suffer the deceptions of the powerful **Śuṣṇa** to prevail over his weapons, nor did he (leave him) any of his sustenance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

From the sage: daśoṇaye kavaye = **bahu** kaviṣkāt medhāvinaḥ, from the wise man offeing many oblations, that is tvatsahāyakutsāt, from **Kutsa**, your ally; elsewhere Daśoṇi is the name of an **asura**
