## English translation:

“At the rites at which **soma** (is offered) the exhilaration (produced) in **Indra** is a shower (of benefits to the offerer); so is the chanted hymn with the (recited) prayer, therefore the drinker of the soma, the partaker of the stale soma, **Maghavan**, is to be propitiated by men with praises; dweller in heaven, he is the lord of sacred songs, unwearied in the protection (of his votaries).”
