## English translation:

“By praises and by sacrifices, **Indra**, (men) bring down (what they desire) from you, as the waters (descend) from the top of the mountain; desirous of food, they approach you, who are accessible to praise, with these their eulogies, as (eagerly as) coursers rush to battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The same verse is addressed to **Agni** in **Sāmaveda**
