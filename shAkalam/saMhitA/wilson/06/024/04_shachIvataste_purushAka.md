## English translation:

“Accomplisher of many acts, the energies of you who are (ever) active (congregate from all directions), like the converging tracks of cattle; they are the bonds (of foes), themselves unfettered, munificent **Indra**, like the tethers of (many) calves.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The energies: **śākāḥ** śaktayaḥ, abilities, energies; the verb is added: sarvataḥ saṃcarantī, come together from all sides; gavām iva srutayaḥ sañcaraṇīḥ = dhenūnām **mārgāḥ** yathā **sarvatra** sañcāriṇo **bhavanti**, as the paths of milch kine are everywhere going together; the translation is: vatsānām na tantayaḥ, like long ropes used to tie a number of calves together, like the tethers of many calves
