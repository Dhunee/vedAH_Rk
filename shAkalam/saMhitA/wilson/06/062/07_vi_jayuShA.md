## English translation:

“Riders in your car, you have penetrated the mountain by your triumphant chariot; showerers (of benefits) you heard the invocation of **Vadhrimatī**; you have nourished, bountiful givers, the cow of **Śayu**-- and in this manner displaying benevolence are you everywhere present.”
