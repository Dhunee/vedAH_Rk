title = "Rig Veda 6.23.2"

## English translation:

“Or as, although engaged in heaven in the hero-animating conflict with foes, you protect the offerer of the libation, and humblest, undaunted **Indra**, the **Dasyus**, the disturbers of the pious and terrified worshipper, (so do you come when the **soma** is effused.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

There is no verb in the text; 'come' is assumed from the previous ṛca: so, the reading is: when the soma is poured forth
