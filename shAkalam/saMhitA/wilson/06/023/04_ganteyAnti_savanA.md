## English translation:

“May **Indra**, with his steeds, come o us as many (daily) rites (as may be celebrated), bearing the thundeerbolt, drinking the **soma**, bestowing cattle, granting manly and multiplied posterity, hearing the invocation of his adorer, and being the accenter of (our) praises.”
