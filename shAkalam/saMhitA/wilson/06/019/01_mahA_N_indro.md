## English translation:

“May the great **Indra**, who is as a monarch the fulfiller (of the desires) of men, come hither; may he who is mighty over the two (realms of space), uninjurable by (hostile) offers, increase (in capacity) for heroism in our presence; may he who is great (in body), eminent (in qualities), be honoured by the performers (of pious acts).”
