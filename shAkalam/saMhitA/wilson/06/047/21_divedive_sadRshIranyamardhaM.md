## English translation:

“**Indra**, becoming manifest from his abode (in the firmament), dissipates, day by day, the resembling glooms, (so that he may distinguish) the other portion, (or the day); and the showerer has slain the two wealth-seeking slaves, Varcin and **Śambara**, in (the country of) Udavraja.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Udavraja, **deśa** **viśeṣaḥ**, a sort of country, one into which the waters flow, udakāni vrajantyasmin
