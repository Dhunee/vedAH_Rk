## English translation:

“Do you, divine chariot, who are the thunderbolt of **Indra**, the precursor of the **Maruts**, the embryo of **Mitra**, the navel of **Varuṇa**, propitiated by this our sacrifice, accept the oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The precursor of Maruts: marutām anīkam mitrasya garbho varuṇasya **nābhiḥ**: anīkam = agrabhūtam, being before, out-stripping in speed; or, mukhyam, principal or leader; **garbha** of Mitra: the car is said to be contained by Mitra, the ruler of the day, as moving by day; **nābhi** of Varuṇa: it is a fixed point or centre for the deity ruling over the night, when the car of Indra or **Sūrya** stands still; another interpretation: garbha is from gṛ, to praise; mitrasya garbha = sūryeṇa stūyamāna, to be praised by the sun; nābhi is from nābh, to injure; hence, the weapon of Varuṇa
