## English translation:

“We have wandered, gods, into a desert where there is no track of cattle; the vast extant earth has become the protectress of murderers; direct us, **Bṛhaspati**, in our search for cattle; show the path, **Indra**, to your votary being astray.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Garga**, the author of this **sūkta**, is said to have lost his way in a desert; he repeated this ṛca to Bṛhaspati and Indra, who enabled him to regain his road; no track of cattle: agavyūti kṣetram = gosañcararahitam deśam, a plural ce devoid of the grazing of cattle
