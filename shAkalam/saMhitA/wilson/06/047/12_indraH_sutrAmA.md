## English translation:

“May the protecting, opulent **Indra** be the bestower of felicity by his protections; may he, who is all-knower of felicity by his protections; may he, who is all-knowing, foil our adversaries; may he keep us out of danger, and may we be the possessors of excellent posterity.”
