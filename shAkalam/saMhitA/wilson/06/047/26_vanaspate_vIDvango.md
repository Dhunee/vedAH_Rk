## English translation:

“(Chariot made of the) forest lord, be strong of fabric; be our friend; be our protector, and be manned by warriors; you are wrapped with cow-hides; keep us steady; and may he who rides in you be victorious over conquered (foes).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be manned by warriors: suvīro **bhava** = śūrabhaṭt.aiḥ putrādibhir vā **yuktaḥ**, joined with warriors, or with sons and the rest; you are wrapped with cow-hides: **gobhiḥ** sannaddhosi = you are bound together by cow; govikāraiḥ, by what are formed from cattle; in the next ṛca, gobhirāvṛtam = carmabhiḥ parita aveṣṭitam, encompassed round with hides, as if the exterior of the war-chariot especially were so strengthened; or, encompassed with rays of light, or with splendours, gobhiḥ, tejobhiḥ
