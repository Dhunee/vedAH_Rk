## English translation:

“**Indra**, the prototype, has assumed various forms, and such is his form as that which (he adopts) for his manifestation; Indra, multiform by his illusion, proceeds (to his many worshippers), for the horses, yoked to his car are a thousand.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra has assumed: Indra presents himself as **Agni**, **Viṣṇu**, or **Rudra**, or any other deity who is the actual object of worship, and is really the deity tobe adored; he is identifiable with each; Horses yoked: Indra's chariots and horses are multiplied according to the forms in which he manifests himself; Indra is here identified with **Parameśvara**, the supreme first cause, identical with creation
