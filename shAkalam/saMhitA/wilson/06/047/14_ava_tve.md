## English translation:

“To you the praises and prayers of the worshipper hasten like a torrent down a declivity; and you thunderer, aggregate the immense wealth (of sacrificial offerings), copious libations, and milk, and the **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Apo gāḥ yuvase samindūn: apo = vasatīvarī which is said by **Kātyāyana** **Sūtra** 8.9.7-10 to be portions of water taken from a running stream on the evening previous to the ceremony, and kept in jars in different parts of the sacrificial chamber, to be mixed with the Soma; cf. **Taittirīya** **Yajus**., **Prapāṭhaka** III. Anuvāka XII).
