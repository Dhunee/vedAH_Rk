## English translation:

“Like one who goes before us, **Indra**, (on the road), look out, bring before us infinite wealth; be our conductor beyond the bounds (of want), convey us safely over (peril); be our careful guide, our gude to desirable (affluence).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Look out: pra ṇaḥ **pura** eteva **paśya**, like one who is preceding us, look; look after the travellers under the charge of the mārgarakṣaka, the protector of the road, an escort, or perhaps, the leader of a kāfilā
