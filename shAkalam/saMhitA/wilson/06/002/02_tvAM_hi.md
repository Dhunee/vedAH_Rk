## English translation:

“Men verily worship you with sacrifice and with praises; the inoffensive sun, the sender of rain, the beholder of the universe, proceeds to you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

It is said that the sun, at the evening enters into fire, therefore the latter is visible throughout the night; the term for sun in the text is, **vājin**, he who goes swiftly; this is an appellative also of fire and wind: Agnirvāyuḥ **sūryas** te vai **vājinaḥ**, fire, wind, the sun, they verily are **vājins** (**Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.6.3.9)
