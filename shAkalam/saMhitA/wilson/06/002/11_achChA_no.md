## English translation:

“Divine **Agni**, reverenced as a friend, who are abiding in heaven and earth, communicate our praise to the gods; conduct the offerer of adoration to domestic felicity; and may we overcome our adversaries, our iniquities, our difficulties; may we overcome those (sins of a prior existence); may we overcome them by your protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May we overcome those (sins): the text has tā tarema, may we cross over those, this is interpreted as: janmāntarakṛtāni pāpāni
