## English translation:

“You are now to be praised among the people, for you are our well beloved guest, venerated like an elder in the city, and to be cherished like a son.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Venerated like an elder in a city: raṇvaḥ purīva jūryaḥ sūnur na trayayāyyaḥ; the first part is interpreted nagaryām vṛddho hitopadeṣṭā **rājā** iva **ramaṇīyaḥ**, to be had recourse to as to an old rājā giving good council in a city; the second half, **putra** iva pālanīyaḥ, to be cherished like a son; or, trayayāyya may be explained as endowed with three merits, learning, penance, devotion; or one having had three births, the natural, investiture with the sacred string, and initiation or preparation for sacred rites, **dīkṣā**: māturagredhijananam dvitīyam bhaunjibandhanāt tṛtīyam **yajña** dīkṣāyā iti janmatrayam smṛtam (**Manu**. 2.169)
