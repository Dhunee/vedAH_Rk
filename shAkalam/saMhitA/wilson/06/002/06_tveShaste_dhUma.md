## English translation:

“The pure smoke of you the resplendent spreads through the firmament, matures (in clouds), and you, the purifier, shine with radiance like the sun, when propitiated by praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shine with radiance: dyutā tvam **kṛpā** rocase, you shine with light by praise; kṛpā may also denote dīptyā, with lustre; here, it is explained as stutyā, by praise, by that which is able to compel the presence of a deity, abhimukhīkaraṇa **sāmarthya** (**Nirukta** 6,8); kṛp also means to be able or capable, sāmarthyena, diptyā vā, by ability, power, or by lustre
