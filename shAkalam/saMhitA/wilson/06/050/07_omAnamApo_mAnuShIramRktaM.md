## English translation:

“Waters, friendly to mankind, grant uninterrupted (life) preserving (food) for (the perpetuation of our) sons and grandsons; grant us security and the removal (of all evil), for you are more than maternal physicians; you are the parents of the stationary and moveable universe.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Security and the removal of all evil: śaṃyoḥ: śamanam upadravāṇām, the appeasing of oppressiosn or violences; yāvanam pṛthakkartavyānām, the making separate of those things which are to be kept off
