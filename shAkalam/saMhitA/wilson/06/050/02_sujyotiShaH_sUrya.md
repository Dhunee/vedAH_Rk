## English translation:

“Radiant **Sūrya**, render the luminous deiies, who have **Dakṣa** for their progenitor, void of offence towards us; they who are twice born, desirous of sacrifice, observant of truth, possessors of wealth, deserving of worship, whose tongue is **Agni**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who have Dakṣa: Dakṣapitṛn = **dakṣaḥ** pitāmaho yeṣām, they of whom Dakṣa is the grandfather; the grandchildren of Dakṣa were sentiments and passions; pitara, therefore, is understood only in the genitive ral sense of priority or seniority; they who are twice born: dvijanmānaḥ, they who have two births, i.e. they who are manifest or present in two spheres, heaven and earth
