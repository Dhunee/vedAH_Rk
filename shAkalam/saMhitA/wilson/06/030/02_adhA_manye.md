## English translation:

“I now glorify his vast and **asura**-destroying (vigour); those exploits that he has determined (to achieve) no one can resist; (by him) the sun was made daily visible; and he, the doer of great deeds, spread out the spacious regions (of the universe).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sun was made visible: an allusion to **Indra** breaking asunder the clouds
