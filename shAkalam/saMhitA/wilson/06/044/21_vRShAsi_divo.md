## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, are the showerer of heaven, the bearer of earth, the feeder of the rivers, the supplier of the aggregated (waters); for you, showerer (of benefits), who are the most excellent shedder of rain, the sweet **Soma**, the honey-flavoured, is ready to be quaffed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Note the use of derivative of **vṛṣa**, to sprinkle, to rain; Indra's horses are **vṛṣaṇa**; they draw a vṛṣa **ratha**; and are guided by vṛṣarasmayaḥ; again, the steeds are vṛṣaṇa = nityatāruṇnu, always young, and Indra is **vṛṣan**, vṛṣ, and **vṛṣabha**, the showerer of rain or of benefits; perhaps, in all these metaphors, a grosser sense is perhaps implied
