## English translation:

“This (**Soma**) has been fixed heaven and earth; this has harnessed the seven-rayed chariot (of the sun); this Soma has developed of its own will the mature deeply-organized secretion in the kind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This has fixed heaven: these functions are ascribed to the Soma as being the source of the energies of **Indra**, who is the real agent, both in this and the preceding verse; this Indra has made the heavens etc.; deeply-organized secretion: daśayantram utsam = a well with ten machines;

Utsa = utsaraṇaśīlam, having the property of flowing forth, **payas**, milk; the epithet daśayantram is intriguing: it may imply aggregated bodily existence, or organs and functions of the body, which are the result of the nutriment furnished to the child by the matured milk agreeably to a **khila**, or cakṣuśca śrotram ca manaśca prāṇāpanau, **deha**, idam śarīram dvau prat yañcāvanulomau visargāv-etam tam manye diśayantram utsam, I consider the eye, the ear, the mind, the speech, the two vital airs, the form, the body, the two creations inverted and direct, as the tenfold utsa, or state of being; or, perhaps Soma is being offered with nine texts to Indra and other deities at the morning sacrifice (**Aitareya** Brāhman.a 3.1)
