## English translation:

“**Indra**, appreciates him who is skilled (in holy rites); a recent friend, quaffing (the libation), he heaps excellent (wealth) upon the devout; partaking of (the sacrificial) food, (and brought) by his robust agitators (of the earth, his steeds), he, through his benevolence, is a protector to his friends.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By his robust: sthaulābhir dhautarībhiḥ = sthūlābhiḥ kampanakāriṇībhiḥ, with the stout causers of trembling;

Implied: vaḍavābhiḥ **yuktaḥ**, joined with such mares; epithets, though feminine nine, may apply to the **Maruts**
