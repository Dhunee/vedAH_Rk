## English translation:

“Guide us, **Sarasvatī**, to precious wealth; reduce us no to insignificance; overwhelm us not with (excess of) water; be plural ased by our friendly (services) and access to our habitations, and let us not repair to plural ces unacceptable to you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Reduce us not: mā apa spharīḥ: sphara = increase, greatness, prosperity; with the prefix, it implies the reverse, apravṛddhān mā kārṣīḥ, do not make us unimportant or abject
