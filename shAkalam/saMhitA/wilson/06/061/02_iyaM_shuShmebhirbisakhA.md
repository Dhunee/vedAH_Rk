## English translation:

“With impetuous and mighty waves she breaks down the precipices of the mountains, like a digger for the lotus fibres; we adore for our protection, the praises and with sacred rites, **Sarasvatī** the underminer of both her banks.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With impetuous and mighty waters: the firs ṛca addresses Sarasvatī as a goddess; in this ṛca, she is praised as a river; in this entire **sūkta**, this alternative attribution is apparent; like a digger for the lotus-fibres: **bisa**-khā iva bisam khanati, who digs the bisa, the long fibres of the stem of the lotus, in delving for which he breaks down the banks of the pond
