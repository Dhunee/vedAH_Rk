## English translation:

“Destroy, **Sarasvatī**, the revilers of the gods, the offspring of the universal deluder, **Bṛsaya**; giver of sustenance, you have acquired for men the lands (seized by the **asuras**), and have showered water upon them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛsaya: Bṛsaya is a name of **Tvaṣṭā**, whose son was **Vṛtra**; **Sāyaṇa**, provides a legend in his introduction to the Black Taittirīa **Yajuṣ**, to illustrate te importance of correctly accentuating the words of the **Veda**: **Indra**, had killed a son of Tvaṣṭā, named **Viśvarūpa**, in conseqence of which there was enmity between them. Upon the occasion of **a Soma** sacrifice celebrated by Tvaṣṭā, he omitted to include Indra in his invitation to the gods. Indra, however, came an uninvited guest, and by force took a part of the **Soma** libation. With the remainder Tvaṣṭā performed a sacrifice for the birth of an individual who should avenge his quarrel and destroy his adversary, directing the priest to pray, now let a man be born and prosper, the killer of Indra. In uttering the **mantra**, however, the officiating priest made a mistake in the accentuation of the term indraghātaka, slayer of Indra, in which sense as a **tatpuruṣa** compound, the acute accent should have been plural ced upon the last syllable. instrumental ad of this, the reciter of the mantra plural ced the acent upon the first syllable, whereby the compound became a **bahuvrīhi** epithet, signifying one of whom Indra is the slayer. Consequently, wen by virtue of the rite, Vṛtra was produced, he was fore-doomed by the wrong accentuation to be put to death by Indra instrumental ad of becoming the destroyer. You have acquired for men: kṣitibhyo avanīravindo viṣam abhyo **asravaḥ** = you have shed poison upon them, or destroyed them
