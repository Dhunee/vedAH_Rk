## English translation:

“You have both (ever) been victorious; never have been conquered; neither of you two has been vanquished; with whomsoever you have contended you have thrice conquered thousands.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tredhā sahasram vi tad airayethām vyakramethām: the treble manner of kinds mean: the world, the **vedas**, and speech; lokavedavāgātmanā **tridhā** sthitam, being in three ways, consisting of speech, the vedas, the world;

Sahasram = amitam, unmeasured, infinite; **Aitareya** Brāhman.a vi.15: After **Indra** and **Viṣṇu** had overcome the **asuras**, Indra said to them, we will divide he universe with you; whatever Viṣṇu traverses with three steps shall be ours the rest shall be for you, to which the asuras consented. With his first step Viṣṇu traversed the **three worlds**; with his second he traversed, vicakrame, the vedas; and with the third he crossed over all speech: sarvasya vāco upari tṛīyam pādam prakṛptavān, so that, in fact, nothing was left for the asuras. What is sahasram? It implies infinite, or the whole, which is by combining all worlds, all vedas, all modes of speech. **Taittirīya**, seventh **kāṇḍa** is cited: **sahasra** = sarvam **jagat**, the whole world
