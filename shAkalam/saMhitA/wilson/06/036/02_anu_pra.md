## English translation:

“The worshipper praises especially the strength of that **Indra**, verily they rely upon him for heroic deeds; they offer sacrifices to him as the seizer of an uninterrupted series of foes, their assailant, their subduer, and also for the destruction of **Vṛtra**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Seiser of an uninterrupted series of foes: syūmagṛbhe = syūtān avicchedena vartamānān śatrūn gṛhṇate, to him who seizes enemies being lines or threads without interruption
