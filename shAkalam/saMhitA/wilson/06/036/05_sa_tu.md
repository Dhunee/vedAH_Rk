## English translation:

“Hear, **Indra**, (the praises) that may be heard (by you), you, who are gratified by our adoration, and, like the sun, (prevail) over the ample riches of the enemy; endowed with strength, being glorified in every age, rendered comprehensible by (sacrificial) food, be to us no other (than as such as you have been).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the sun: dyaur na bhūmābhi rāyo **aryaḥ** = arer dhnāni bahutarāṇi **sūrya** iva abhibhavasi;

Abhi = **abhibhu**; by to us no other: aso yathā naḥ = not he as to us; that is, yena prakāreṇa asmākam asādhāraṇo asi sa tathā saḥ syāḥ, in what manner you are especially of exclusively ours, so may you be that, our property or friend
