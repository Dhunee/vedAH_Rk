## English translation:

“Such, **Indra**, as you are represented in holy texts, assail (our) adversaries with fierceness like (that of) a bull in close conflict; regard yourself as our defender in war, (that we may long enjoy) posterity, water, and the sight of the) sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Represented in holy texts: ṛcīṣama = ṛgyādṛśam rūpam pratipādayati tādṛg rūpendraḥ, such form as the Ṛc exhibits, such in form is Indra; posterity, water and sun: tanuṣu, apsu, sūrye = in descendants, in waters, in the sun; connecting this what precedes: asmākam **bodhi** avitā mahādhane, know yourself to be our protector in battle, in descendants, etc., that is in securing to us these good things and long life
