## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The plural asant abode of their progenitors: **priyā** **śarma** pitṛṇām = priyāṇi sthānāni janakānām sambandhinī, the beloved plural ces in relation with progenitors; tanvo vitanvate, they spread out or rest their person ns; or, they spread out before the enemy the sites won by their forefathers until they abandon them, parityajanti yāvat; i.e. until they, the enemy, **desis** fom the attack; an unsuspected defence: chardiracittam = kavacam śatrubhir ajñātam, armour unknown by the enemies
