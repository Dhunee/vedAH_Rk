## English translation:

“Men exalt you upon earth; they exalt you for both kinds of affluence, (cattle and treasure, which you bestow upon) men; you who extricate (us from evil) are to be known as our preserver, as the unfailing father and mother of mankind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Which you bestow upon, men: janānām may also mean, for the gift of men, that is, of **male** posterity
