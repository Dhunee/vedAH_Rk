## English translation:

“Men desirous of food obtain abundance unopposed when repairing to the station of the divinity with oblations; and when delighting, **Agni**, in your auspicious presence, they repeat those your names which are to be uttered at sacrifices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They repeat those your names: nāmāni cid dadhire yajñīyāni, that is, such appellations as **jātavedas**, **vaiśvānara**, and means of adoration, stotrāṇi namanasādhanāni
