## English translation:

“Possessor of wealth, bestow upon us at all times opulence conjoined with dependants, and (grant) abundance of cattle to our sons and grandsons; may therefore be to us abundant food, satisfying our wishes, and free from blame; and may there be auspicious and reputable (means of subsistence).”
