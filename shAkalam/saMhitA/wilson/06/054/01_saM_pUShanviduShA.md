## English translation:

“Bring us, **Pūṣan**, into communication with a wise man who may rightly direct us, who may even say, this is so.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ya evedam iti bravat: **viduṣa** = a wise man, a cunning man, a conurer; one who says, this, your property, has been lost, and the preceding paggage directs the way to the recovery of the lost or stolen goods; Pūṣan is thus portrayed as the patron of fortune-tellers and recoverers of stolen property
