## English translation:

“(I incite the worshipper) to offer worship to **Agni**, who is to be adored at the sacrifices of every ma; whose acts are free from arrogance; the lord of the two youthful (brides, heaven and earth); the child of heaven, the son of strength, the briliant symbol of sacrifice.”
