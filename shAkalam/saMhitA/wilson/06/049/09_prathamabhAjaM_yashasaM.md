## English translation:

“May the illustrious **Agni**, the invoker of the gods, worship (with this oblation), **Tvaṣṭā**, the first divider (of forms), the renowned, the giver of food, the well-handed, the vast, the adored of householders, the readily invoked.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The adored: yajatam pastyānām: pastyam = house, and by metonymy used for householder, gṛhasthair yajanīyam
