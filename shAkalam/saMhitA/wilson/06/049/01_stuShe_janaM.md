## English translation:

“I commend with new hymns the man observant of his duty, and the beneficent **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**; may they, the mighty ones, Varuṇa, Mitra, and **Agni**, come to our rite, and listen (to our praises).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The man observant: stuṣe janam suvratam = daivyam janam, the divine people, devasaṅgham, the company of the gods
