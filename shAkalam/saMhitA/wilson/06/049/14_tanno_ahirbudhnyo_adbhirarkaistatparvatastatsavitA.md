## English translation:

“May **Ahirbudhnya** (propitiated) by (our) hymns, and **Parvata** and **Savitā** give us food with water; may the bountiful (gods supply us), addition, with vegetable (grains); and may the all-wise **Bhaga** be propitious (to us) for (the acquisition of) riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ahirbudhnya: **budhna** = **antarikṣa**, firmament;

Budhnya = what or who is there born;

Ahi = he who goes, i.e., in the sky;

Parvata: the filler, pūrayitrī, or the wielder of the thunderbolt, parvavad-vajram tadvān; or, enemy of the mountain, gireḥ **śatru**; in either sense, the reference is to **Indra**; with vegetable grains: tad oṣadhibhir abhi = **oṣadhayas** **tila** māṣādayaḥ, the vegetables are sesamum, pulse and the like
