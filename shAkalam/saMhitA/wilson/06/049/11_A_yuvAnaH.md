## English translation:

“Ever youthful wise, and adorable **Maruts**, come to the praise of your adorer; thus augmenting, leaders (of rites), and spreading (through the firmament), like rays (of light), refresh the scanty woods (with rain).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like rays of light: nakṣanto aṅgirasvat = **aṅgirasaḥ** gamanaśīlāraśmayaḥ, rays endowed with motions; te yatha śīghram nabhastalam vyāpnuvanti tad vat, as they spread quickly through the sky, so) do the winds; or, if **aṅgirasa** is a reference to a ṛṣi, the property of rapid movement is assigned to the ṛṣis: yad va ṛṣayastad vacchīghragāminaḥ
