## English translation:

“**Parjanya** and **Vāta**, showerers of rain, and from te firmament available waters; sage **Maruts**, hearers of the truth, establishers of the world, multiply the moveable (wealth of him) by whose praises (you are propitiated).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Multiply: jagad ākṛṇudhvam = **jagat**: fixed as well as moveable, all living things, jagat **sthāvara** jaṅgamātmakam sarvam prāṇijātam
