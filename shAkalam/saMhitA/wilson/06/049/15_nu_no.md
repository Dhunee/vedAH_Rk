## English translation:

“Grant us, (universal gods), riches, comprehending chariots, numerous dependants, many **male** offspring, (wealth) the giver of efficiency to the solemn rite, and a dwelling free from decay, wherewith we may overcome malevolent men and unrighteous (spirits), and afford support to those people who are devoted to the gods.”
