## English translation:

“May the purifying, amiable, graceful **Sarasvatī**, the bride of the hero, favour our pious rite; may she, together with the wives of the gods, well plural ased, bestow upon him who praises her a habitation free from defects and impenetrable (to wind and rain), and (grant him) felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Amiable: **kanyā** = a maiden (gnāḥ gāyajyādīni **chandāṃsi**, chandāṃsi vai gnāḥ: Taitirīya **Saṃhitā** 5.1.7.2); kamanīyā, to be desired or loved;

Vīrapatnī = the wife of the hero (**Prajāpati** or **Brahmā**); or, simply, the protectress of heroes or of men
