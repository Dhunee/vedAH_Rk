## English translation:

“Lord of the house, **Agni**, we, among men, promote your increase by **soma** or fuel; may our domestic fires be supplied with all that is essential; enliven us with brilliant radiance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With all that is essential: asthūri = asthūriṇa gārhapatyāni santu; isthūri is properly a one-horse car or waggon which bring either the soma or fuel; with negative prefix asthūri, it implies a non-one-horse cart, that is a cart with a full team, and metonymically, its contents, or a full supply of what is wanted for a perfect sacrifice, such as children, cattle, riches, asthūriṇi **putra**-**paśu**-dhanādibhiḥ saṃpūrṇāni
