## English translation:

“**Agni**, minister of the sacrifice, bright wiht purifying lustre, approve of that (worship) which is this day celebrated by the instrumental tutor of the rite; you verily are the sacrificer, therefore address the worship (to the gods); and since by your greatness you are all-pervading, therefore, youngest (of the gods), accept the oblations which are today (presented) to you.”
