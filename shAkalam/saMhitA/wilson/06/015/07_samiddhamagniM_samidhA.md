## English translation:

“I glorify with praise the kindled **Agni**, pure purifying, permanent, (plural ced) before (us) at the sacrifice; let us celebrate with plural asant (hymns) the wise Agni, the invoker of the gods, the adored of many, the benevolent, the far-seeing, him who knows all that exists.”
