## English translation:

“Look, **Agni**, upon the (sacrificial) viands duly deposited (upon the altar); heaven and earth detain you to sacrifice (to the gods); opulent Agni, protect us in battle, whereby we may pass safe over all evils; may we pass over those of a prior existence; may we pass over them by your protection.”
