## English translation:

“The priests churn you, **Agni**, as was done by **atharvan**, and bring him from the glooms of night wandering deviously, but not bewildered.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Wandering deviously, but not bewildered: aṅkuyantam amuram: the reference is to a legent of Agni's attempting at first to run away from the gods, devebhyaḥ pālayamānam
