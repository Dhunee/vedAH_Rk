## English translation:

“(Propitiate him) who shines upon the earth with purifying and enlightening lustre, as the dawns with ligt; him, who like (a warrior) discomfiting (his foes) quickly blazed forth in the contest in defence of **etaśa**; him, who is satiated (with food), exempt from decay.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In defence of etaśa;

Etaśa = a horse?
