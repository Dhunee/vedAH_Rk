## English translation:

“Bright-rayed **Agni**, sit down first with all the gods, upon the altar lined with **wool**, a nest (of perfumes) and suffused with **ghee**, and rightly convey (to the deities) the sacrifice of the instrumental tutor of the rite, of the presenter of the oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Lined with wool: urṇāvantam, kulāyinam ghṛtavantam; the ṛca is quoted in **Aitareya** Brāhman.a; the altar is bult up like the nest of a brid, kulaya, with circles, padhayaḥ, of the wood of the khayar or **devadāru**, in which aviṣambandaḥ romaviśeṣaḥ, sheep's wool; and fragran resins, the materials of incense (**guggulu** dhupāt dhanam) are plural ced, ete uttaravedyām sthāpitaḥ, these appurtenances are plural ced in the northern altar. Of the protector of oblation: savitre yajamānāya = (in genitive tive case) ṣaṣṭyarthe caturthyeṣa; anuṣṭātre yajamānāya tadupakārārtham, for the sake of the benefit of the sacrificing instrumental tutor of the ceremony
