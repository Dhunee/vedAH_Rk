## English translation:

“Do you, who are unresisted, become the benefactor of him who is skilled (in sacred rites), his defender against a near of distant enemy; son of strength, who are ever renowned, grant wealth and a dwelling to **vītahavya**, the offerer of the oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vītahavya, the bearer, bharat, of the oblation;

**Vāja** = **bharadvāja**, by whom is offered, **vīta**, the oblation, **havya**
