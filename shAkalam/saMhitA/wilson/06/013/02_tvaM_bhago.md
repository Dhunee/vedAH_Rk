## English translation:

“Do you, who are adorable, bestow upon us precious wealth; beautiful with radiance, you pass (around) like the circumambient (wind); you, divine **Agni**, are like **mitra**, the giver of abundant water and ample wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who are adorable: tvam bhago na = you like **bhaga**; bhago, as an adjective, bhajanīya, to be worshipped or propitiated;

Na = naḥ, us
