## English translation:

“That man, the protector of the virtuous, destroys, **Agni**, his enemy by his strength, and baffles, intelligent, the might of (the **asura**) **paṇi**, whom you, the wise, the parent of the sacrifice, consentient with the grandson of the waters, encourage (in the hope of) riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Consentient with the grandson of the waters: sajoṣā naptrāpām, the grandson of the waters = the lightning, vidyutagninā **saṅgatās** tvam, you associated with the lightning-fire
