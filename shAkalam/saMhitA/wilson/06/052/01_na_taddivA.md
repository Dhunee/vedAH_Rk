## English translation:

“I do not regard it as worthy (of the gods) of heaven, or (those) of earth, as (fit to be compared) with the sacrifice (I offer) or with these (our) sacred rites; let, then, the mighty mountains overhelm him; let the employer of Atiyāja be ever degraded.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
