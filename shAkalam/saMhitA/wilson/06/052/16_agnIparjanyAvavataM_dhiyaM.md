## English translation:

“**Agni** and **Parjanya**, prosper my pious acts; (accept), you who are reverently invoked, our praise at this sacrifice; one of you genitive rates food, the other posterity; grant us, therefore, food productive of descendants.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

One of you genitive rates: iḷām anyo janayat garbham **anyaḥ**: Parjanya, by sending rain, causes the growth of corn, and Agni, as the main agent in digestion, produces the vigour necessary for procreation
