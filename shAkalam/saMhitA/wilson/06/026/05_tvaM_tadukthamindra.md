## English translation:

“**Indra**, who are the subduer (of foes), you have achieved a glorious (deed), inasmuch as you have scatered, hero, the hundreds and thousands (of the host of **Śambara**), have slain the slave Śambara (when issuing) from the mountain, and have protected **Divodāsa** with marvellous protections.”
