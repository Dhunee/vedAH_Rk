## English translation:

“The son of **Vājini**, (**Bharadvāja**), offering (sacrificial) viands, invokes you for (the sake of) acquiring obtainable and abundant food; (he invokes) you, **Indra**, the preserver of the good, the defender (from the wicked), when enemies (assail him); he depends upon you when, lifting up his fist, he is fighting for (his) cattle.”
