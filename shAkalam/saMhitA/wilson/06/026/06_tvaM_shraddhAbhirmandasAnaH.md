## English translation:

“Delighted by libations offered wiḥ faith, you have consigned Cumuri to the sleeop (of death) on behalf of **Dabhīti**, and bestowing (the maiden) **Raji** upon Piṭhīnas, you have, by your contrivance, destroyed sixty thousand (warriors) at once.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Piṭhīnas: rajim piṭhīnase daśasyan: raji = etadākhyām kanyām, a maiden called; it may also be a synonym of rājyam, kingdom, dominion; by your contrivance: śacyā = prajñāyā; it may also import **karmaṇā**, by act or exploit
