## English translation:

“You have animated the sage with (the hope of) obtaining food; you have cut to pieces **Śuṣṇa** for **Kutsa**, the donor of the oblation; you have struck off the head (of **Śambara**), imagining himself invulnerable, intending to give plural asure to Atithigvan.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Imagining himself invulnerable: amarmaṇaḥ = marmahīnam ātmānam manyamānasya, of him thinking himself devoid of any fatally vulnerable part
