## English translation:

“Protectors of many, the daughter of **Sūrya** ascended your chariot the defence of hundreds, for refuge sagacious leaders and guides, you have excelled by your devices (all others) at this appearance of the adorable (deities).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Leaders and guides: **narā** nṛtyu = guides and dancers; you have excelled: a reference is to the legend of the **Aśvins** carrying off in their car the daughter of Sūrya from the other gods, as narrated in **Aitareya** Brāhman.a iv.7
