## English translation:

“Protectors of many, vast (wealth) is to be distributed by you; give us then nutritious and invariable food. Givers of delight, there are to you, adorers, and fit praise, and libations, which are prepared to acknowledge your liberality.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nutritious and invariable food: dhenum na iṣam pinvatam askrām = give us a cow, food, that does not stray;

**Dhenu** = prīṇayitrī, gratifying; iṣam may be the adjective for eṣaṇīyam, give us a desirable cow
