## English translation:

“Endowed with natural force possessed of (swift) horses, **Indra**, the overcomer of the adversaries, (sets free) the waters at the southern (declination); thus liberated the waters expand daily to the insatiable goal whence there is no returning.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Southern declination: āpo dakṣiṇataḥ, the waters from or at the south; **dakṣiṇāyana** may be intended, the sun's course south from the northern limit of the tropics; this heralds the commencement of the rainy season
