## English translation:

“He verily knows the threads of the warp and or the woof, he speaks in due season what is to be said, who comprehends all this (universe); who is the protector of ambrosial water, sojourning both above and below, and contemplating (the world) under a different (manifestation).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Contemplatingthe worlds: or, as the sun, while upon earth **Agni** or **vaiśvānara** is manifest as fire
