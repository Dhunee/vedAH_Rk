## English translation:

“A steady light, swifter than thought, stationed among moving beings to show (the way) to happiness all the gods being of one mind, and of like wisdom, proceed respectfully to the presence of the one (chief) agent (**vaiśvānara**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A steady light: According to the vedāntins, the light is **brahma**, seated spontaneously in the heart as the means of true knowledge, to which all the senses, together with the mind and consciousness, refer, as to the one cause of creation, or **paramātmā**, **supreme spirit**
