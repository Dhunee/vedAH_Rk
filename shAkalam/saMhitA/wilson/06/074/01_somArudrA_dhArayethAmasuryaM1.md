## English translation:

“**Soma** and **Rudra**, confirm (in us the strength) of **asuras** may sacrifices in every dwelling adequately reach you; do you, possessors of the seven precious things, besow happiness upon us; happiness upon our bipeds and quadrupeds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Possessors of seven precious things: sapta **ratnā** dadhāna; perhaps a reference to seven **dhātus** or seven elements
