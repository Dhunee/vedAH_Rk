## English translation:

“When, **Indra**, will you bring together leaders with leaders, heroes with heroes, and give us victory in battles? When will you conquer from the enemy the threefold-food-supplying cattle? (When will you grant) us, Indra, diffusive wealth?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Threefold-food-supplying: tridhātu gāḥ, cows having three elements of nutriment, as milk, curds and butter
