## English translation:

“Direct him who is actually our adversary into a different (course); mighty **Indra**, who are a hero, the destroyer (of enemies), therefore are you glorified; never may I desist from the praise of the giver of pure (gifts); satisfy, sage Indra, the **aṅgirasas** with food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Into a different course: i.e. consign him to death, a course different from that of living beings; never may I desist: mā niraram śukradughasya dhenoḥ = may I not cease from the cow the yielder of pure milk;

Dhenoḥ = **vacas**, stotrat, from praise; or, may I never depart from the milch cows given, Indra, by you
