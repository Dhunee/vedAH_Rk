## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Agni**, verily you have combated for (the recovery of) the cows, the waters, the sun, the dawns that had been carried away (by the **asuras**); you reunite, Indra (with the world), the quarters of the horizon, the sun, the wonderful waters, the dawns, the cattle and so do you, Agni, who have the **Niyut** steeds.”
