## English translation:

“Counteract all oppressions (committed) by the pious; counteract all oppressions (committed) by the impious; protectors of the virtuous, destroy all those who hate us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hato vṛtrāṇi **āryā** hasto dāsāni: vṛtrāṇi and dāsāni are neuter and may not signify **āryas** and **dāsas** themselves; so, the interpretation is: āryaiḥ and dāsaiḥ kṛtāni, things done by them severally, that is, upadravajātāni, things genitive rated by violence or oppression and the like. This is a remarkable equivalence between āryas and dāsas
