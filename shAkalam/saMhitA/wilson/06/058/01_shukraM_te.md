## English translation:

“One of your forms, (**Pūṣan**), is luminous, one is venerable; so that the day is variously complexioned; for you are like the sun; verily, bestower of food, you protect all intelligence; may your auspicious liberality be manifested on this occasion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Cf. **Nirukta**, 12.17; you are like the sun: Pūṣan is identified with both day and night, or is considered as their regulator
