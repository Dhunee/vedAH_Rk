## English translation:

“**Pūṣan** is the kind kinsman of heaven and earth, the lord of food, the possessor of opulence, of goodly form; whom the gods gave to **Sūrya**, vigorous, well-moving, propitiated by (that which is) willingly offered.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Propitiated: kāmena **kṛtaḥ**: paśvādiṣayena stotṛbhir vaśīkṛtaḥ, you are subjected or propitiated by worshippers by means of the **paśu** and other offerings
