## English translation:

“**Agni**, the invoker of the gods, the lord of sacrifice, abides in the dwelling of the instrumental tutor of the rite, to offer sacrifice to heaven and earth; he, the son of strength, the observer of truth, has overspread (the world) from afar, like the sun, with light.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of the instrumental tutor: todasya, from tud, to torment or distress; he who is distressed by ascetic devotion, tapasā pīḍyate, i.e. the **yajamāna**
