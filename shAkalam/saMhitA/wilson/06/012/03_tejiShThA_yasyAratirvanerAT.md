## English translation:

“He, whose pure and spreading flame blazes in the forest, shines with increasing intensity, like the sun on his (celestial) path; rushing like the innoxious (wind) among the plural nts, immortal, unimpeded, he lights up (all things) by his own (lustre).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the sun: todo **adhvan**: todo = the sun, sarvasya **preraka**, the urger, impeller, or animator of all. Like the innoxious winds: adroha na = as of one not liable to be oppressed or harmed, adrogdhavya; or, it may mean the vital air, the non-injurer, the sustainer of all, prānarūpeṇa sarveṣām adrogdha, i.e. the wind, **vāyuḥ**.
