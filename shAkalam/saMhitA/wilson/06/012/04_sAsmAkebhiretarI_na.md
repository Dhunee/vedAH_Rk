## English translation:

“**Agni**, who knows all that exists, is propitiated in our dwelling by our praises, like those gratifying (commendations which proceed) from one soliciting (a favour); feeder upon trees, consumer of forests, impetuous in act as the bull, the (progenitor of calves), he is glorified by the celebration of sacrifices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

From one soliciting favour: etari no etari = gantari, a goer; yācamāne puruṣe vidyamānāni stotrāṇi atyantam **sukha** karāṇi, like praises which being present in a man soliciting, going, or applying to another, are the yielders of very great plural asure.
