## English translation:

“We solicit riches of our friend, (**Pūṣan**), the chief of charioteers, the wearer of a braid (of hair), the lord of infinite wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Wearer of a braid of hair: kapardinam = kapardaścūḍā tadvantam; normally an epithet of **Śiva**; but, **cūḍā** is the lock left on the crown of the head at tonsure
