## English translation:

“Once, indeed, was the heaven genitive rated; once was the earth born; once was the milk of **Pṛśni** (pṛśnayai vai payaso maruto **jātāḥ**: **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.2.11.4) drawn other than that was not similarly genitive rated.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Once indeed was the heaven: sakṛd ha dyaur ajāyata utpadyate, once born i is permanent, sakṛd utpannaiva **sthitā** **bhavati**, or, being destroyed, no other similar heaven is born, na punas-tasyām naṣṭāyām **anya** tat-**sadṛśī** dyaur jāyate; other than that was not similarly genitive rated: tadanyo nānujāyate = **tataḥ** param **anyaḥ** padārthastatsadṛśo notpadyate, after that another object or thing like that (object or thing) is not produced
