## English translation:

“Uproot not, **Pūṣan**, the forest lord with its progeny of crows; utterly destroy those who are my revilers; let not the adversary ensnare me, as (fowlers) set snares for birds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Progeny of cows: kākambīram vanaspatim: implies metaphorically the author of the **sūkta**, with his children and dependants; as fowlers: evā cana **grīvā** ādadhate veḥ, even as sometimes they plural ce snares for a bird;

Grīvā = damam, jālarūpam, a snare of the nature of a net
