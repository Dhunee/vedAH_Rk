## English translation:

“I now (glorify) the brilliant vigour of the company of the **Maruts**, loud-sounding, irresistible, cherishing, whereby hundreds and thousands (of treasures) are bestowed collectively upon men; may that (company) make hidden wealth manifes; may it render the wealth easily accessible to us.”
