## English translation:

“Divine **Indra** and **Agni**, augmenters of sacrifice by whom the acclamation (of praise) is received, you partake not of the (**Soma**) of him who, when the libation is effused, praises you (improperly), uttering unacceptable eulogies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Praises you improperly: yo vam stavat, he who may praise you badly, kutsitam stūyat; uttering unacceptable eulogies: joṣavākam vadataḥ: prītihetutvena kartavyam svay aprītikaram vacam, speech to be uttered with the design of gaining affection, but of itself producing disaffection or dislike; so, in **Nirukta** 5.22: ya indragnī suteṣu vām someṣu stauti teṣu na tasya aśnīthaḥ, of him who praises you two, Agni and Indra, when the Soma juices are effused you do not eat (the offering); the Nirukta has: you eat, omitting the negative;

Joṣavākam: avijñatanāmadheyam joṣayitavyam **bhavati**, that being of unknown name is to be propitiated; yo **ayam** joṣavākam vadati viañjapaḥ na tasya aśnīthaḥ, this person n who utters, joṣavākam, repeating incessantly, or silently, propitiatory prayer of various objects, of that man, you two do not eat the offering
