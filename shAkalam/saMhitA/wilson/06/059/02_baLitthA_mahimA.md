## English translation:

“Your greatness, **Indra** and **Agni**, is after this fashion, and is most deserving of praise; the same is your progenitor; twin brethren are you, having a mother everywhere present.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ihehamātarau, of whom the mother is here and there; **Aditi** is their mother, in common with all the gods, and she is here identified with he wide extended earth, **vistīrṇa** **bhūmiḥ**
