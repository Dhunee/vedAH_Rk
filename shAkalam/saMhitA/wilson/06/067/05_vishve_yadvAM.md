## English translation:

“Inasmuch as all the gods equally plural ased and rejoicing in your greatness conferred strength upon you, and since you are pre-eminen over the wide heaven and earth, your courses are unobstructed, unimpeded.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your courses: spaśo adabdhāso amūrā: spaśaḥ = raśmayas **cāra** vā, rays, or perhaps, reins, or goings, which are ahisita, uninjured, amūḍha, not bewildered
