## English translation:

“Upon your approach, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, protectors of the dwelling, your (bounty) is unlimited; when (your) praises are uttered, and the sacrificers add in the ceremony the **Soma** that inspires straightforwardness and resoluion, and is the showerer (of benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your bounty: yuvor askṛdhoyu: yuvābhyām deyam gṛhādikam avicchinnam **bhavati**, that which is to be given by you, as houses and the like, is unchecked;

Askṛdhoyu = long-lived, akṛdhvāyuḥ kṛdhu meaning short, or nikṛttam, cut off; there is also association with **ajara** as in: yo askṛdhoyur **ajaraḥ** svarvān, who is long-lived, free from decay, an occupant of heaven (askṛdhoyurakṛdhvāyuḥ kṛdhviti hasvanāma nikṛttam bhavati: **Nirukta** 6.3)
