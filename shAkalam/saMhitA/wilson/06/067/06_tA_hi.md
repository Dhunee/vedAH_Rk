## English translation:

“You manifest vigour daily, you strengthen the summit of the sky as if with a pillar; the solid firmamen and the universal deity (the sun) replenish earth and heaven with the food of man.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As if with a pillar: upamād iva: upamāt = **sthūṇa**, a **post** or pillar-- the post to which a calf is tied
