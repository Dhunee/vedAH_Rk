## English translation:

“This my praise is addressed to you both, and proceeds to you beloved (deities) together with the oblation; the sacred grass is spread before you; grant us, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa** an unassailable dwelling, that through your favour, munificent divinities, may be a (secure) shelter.”
