## English translation:

“(Exterminate also), **Mitra** and **Varuṇa** those who emulously contending, disturb the rites that are agreeable and beneficial to you both; those divinities, those mortals, who are not diligent in adoration, those who performing works perform not sacrifices, those who do not propitiate you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Exterminate also: na ye devāsa ohasā na martā ayajñasāco apyo na putrāḥ: ohasā = vahanasādhanena, by the means of conveying-- perhaps wishes, i.e. stotreṇa, by praise;

**Apyaḥ** = karmavantaḥ, doing acts, from **apas**, but not sacrificin o sacrificing in vain, **vṛthā** karmāṇi kurvantaḥ; na putrāH = not sons, apṛṇantaḥ, not plural asing, or satisfying
