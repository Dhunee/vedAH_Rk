## English translation:

“When the intelligent (priests) offer praise, then some of them, glorifying (**Agni** and other deities), recite the Nivid hymns; such being the case, we address to you sincere adoration, for in consequence of your greatness you do not associate with (other) divinities.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Na kir devebhir yatathaḥ, you do not go, gacchathaḥ, with other gods, anyair devaiḥ **saha**, you are not associated with them at sacrifice
