## English translation:

“You have destroyed the hundred impregnable cities of the **Dasyu**, **Śambara**, when sagacious **Indra**, you, who are brought by the libation, have bestowed in your liberality riches upon **Divodāsa** presenting to you libations, and upon **Bharadvāja** hymning your praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dasyu, Śambara: Śambara is an **asura**; Dasyu and Asura appear to be synonymous
