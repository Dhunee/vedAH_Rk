## English translation:

“Radiant in the embryo of the maternal (earth), on the imperishable (altar); the cherisher of the paternal (heaven), sitting on the seat of sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The cherisher: he **mātuḥ**, putuṣpitā: the mother of **Agni** is the earth, the father is heaven; Agni is said to be the father or fosterer of his parent heaven, by transmitting to it the flame and smoke of burnt-offerings
