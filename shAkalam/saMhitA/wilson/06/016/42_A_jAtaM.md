## English translation:

“(Welcome him) as soon as born, like a beloved guest, and plural ce the lord of the mansion upon the sacred (altar) whence wisdom is derived.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This and previous ṛca are recited when the fire that has been produced by attrition is applied to kindle the **āhavanīya**, or fire of burnt-offerings; **Aitareya** Brāhman.a 1.16; **Agni** is the guest, not the sacriicer, of the āhavanīya fire; jātavedasi is applied to the latter, as knowing the birth of the churned fire, to whom it is a giver of delight, śyona, sukhakara, by giving him a welcome reception.
