## English translation:

“The sage, **Atharvan**, extracted you from upon the lotus-leaf, the head, the support of the universe.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tvam puṣkarād **adhi** atharvo nirmanthata, murdhno viṣvasya vāghataḥ: puṣkarādadhi = puṣkaraparṇe, lotus-leaf; **puṣkara** parṇe prajāpatir bhūmim aparthayat = upon the lotus-leaf **prajāpati** made manifest the earth, a probable acount of the creation in **Manu**; since it supported the earth, it may be termed the head, **mūrdhan**, or the bearer, vāghata for **vāhaka**, of all things; atharvan means **prāṇa**, vital air extracted fire or animal heat from the water, prāṇa udakasakāśād Agnim niśeṣaṇa mathitavān;

Vāghata = **ṛtvij**, the ministrant priest; so the sentence is explained: all the priests churned you out of the head or top of the wood of attrition
