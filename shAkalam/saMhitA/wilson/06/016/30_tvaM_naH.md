## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Enunciator: brahmaṇaskave = mantrasya śabdayitā, sounder or articulator of prayer; for **Agni**, it is said, genitive rated articulate sound, and the **Smṛti** is cited as authority; **manaḥ** kāyāgnim ahanti, sa prerayati manutam, **marutas**-tu urasi caran mandiam janayati svaram, mind excites the fire of the body, that excites the collective vital airs, and they, passing into the breast, engender agreeable, articulate sound.
