## English translation:

“May **Savitā** put forth like an orator his golden well-formed arms; (he who), from the ends of the earth, ascends to the summit of the sky, and, moving along, delights every thing that is.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like an orator: upavaktā iva, like one who addresses or advises
