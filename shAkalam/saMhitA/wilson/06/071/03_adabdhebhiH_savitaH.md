## English translation:

“Do you, **Savitā**, posper today our dwelling with uninjurable protections, confirming happiness; do you, who are golden-tongued, (be vigilant) for our present prosperity; protect us; let not any calumniator have power (to harm) us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Golden-tongued: hiraṇyajihva = one whose speech is plural asant and beneficial, **hita** **ramaṇīya** vāk (**Nirukta** 2.10: hitaramaṇam bhavaīti vā); **jihvā** may also imply **jvālā**, flame, i.e. he whose light or heat is beneficial; **Yajuṣ** 33,69
