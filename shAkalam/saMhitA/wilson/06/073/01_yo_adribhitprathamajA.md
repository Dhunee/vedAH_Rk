## English translation:

“**Bṛhaspati**, who is the breaker of the mountain, the first-born (of **Prajāpati**), the observer of truth, the descendant of **Aṅgirasa**, the partaker of the oblation, the traverser of two worlds, abiding in the region of light, is to us a father; he, the showerer, hunders and in heaven and earth.”
