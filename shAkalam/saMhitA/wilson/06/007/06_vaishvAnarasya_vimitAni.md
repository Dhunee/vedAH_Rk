## English translation:

“The summits of the firmament are measured by the light of **vaiśvānara**, the manifester of ambrosial (rain); all the regions are overspread (by the vapour) on his brow, and the seven gliding (streams) spring from thence like branches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

All the regions: i.e., the smoke that rises from sacrificial fires become clouds in the atmosphere, whence the rain falls and rivers are filled
