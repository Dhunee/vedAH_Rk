“(The worshippers) glorify together, (**Agni**), the bond of sacrifices, the abode of riches, the great receptacle of burnt-offerings; the gods genitive rate vaśvānara, the conveyer of oblations, the emblem of sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The bond of sacrifices: nābhim yañānām: **nābhi** = vahanam, bandhakam, the connecting link or binding of differing rites
