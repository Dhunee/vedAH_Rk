## English translation:

“Resplendent **Agni**, your bright rays, horses let loose (from the rein), shear the earth; your (band of flame), mounting above the high-lands of the many-tinted (earth), blazes fiercely.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shear the earth: kṣām **vapanti**, muṇḍayanti = shave the earth, the plural nts of which constitute the hair; mounting above the highlands: yātayamāno **adhi** **sānu** pṛśneḥ, bhumer-upari parvatāgrādikam **prati** svakīyam agram vyāpārayan, displaying its own point of flame upon the summit, and the like, of the mountains upon the earh; volcanic eruptions are, perhaps, alluded to
