## English translation:

“That exploit is celebrated in the present day (which you have) achieved for **Kutsa**, for Āyu, for Atithigvave; to him you have given many thousands (of riches), and you have quickly elevated Turvayāṇa over the earth by your power.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Turvay_ṇa: same as **Divodāsa**, to whom **Indra** gave the spoils of **Śambara**
