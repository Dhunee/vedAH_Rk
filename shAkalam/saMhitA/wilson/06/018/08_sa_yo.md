## English translation:

“He who is never perplexed, who is no engenderer of that which is in vain, whose name is renowned, who promptly (exerts himself) for the overturning of the cities (of the **asuras**), and for the destruction (of his foes); you, (**Indra**), have indeed slain Cumuri, **Dhuni**, Pipru, **Śambara**, and **Śuṣṇa**.”
