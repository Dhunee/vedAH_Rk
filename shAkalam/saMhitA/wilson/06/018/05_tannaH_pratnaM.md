## English translation:

“May that our ancient friendship with you ever endure; as when, along with the **Aṅgirasas**, celebrating your praises, you, beautiful **Indra**, caster down of the immoveable (roks), did verily slay **Bala**, hurling (his darts against you), and force open his cities, and all his gates.”
