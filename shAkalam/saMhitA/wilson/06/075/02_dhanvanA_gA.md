## English translation:

“May we conquer the cattle (of the enemies) with the bow; with the bow may we be victorious in battle may we overcome our fierce-exulting (enemies) with the bow; may the bow disappoint the hope of the foe; may we subdue with the bow all (hostile) countries.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Exulting: **samadaḥ**: sa, with; **amda**, exhilaration; or, sam, entirely; ad, who devours (**Nirukta** 9.17, 9.18)
