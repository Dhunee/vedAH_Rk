## English translation:

“I cover your vital parts with armour; may the royal **Soma** invest you with ambrosia; may **Varuṇa** amplify your ample felicity; may the gods rejoice (at beholding you) triumphant.”

May Varuṇa amplify: uror varīyo **varuṇas** te kṛṇotu, may Varuṇa make the increase of the large; that is, sukham, happiness
