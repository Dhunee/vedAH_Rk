## English translation:

“The quiver, the parent of many, of whom many are the sons, clangs as it enters into the battle; slung at the back (of the warrior), prolific (of its shafts), it overcomes all shouting hosts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shouting hosts: **saṅkāḥ** **pṛtanāḥ**: **saṅkā** = sounding together, sam kāyanti; **Yāska**, **Nirukta** 9.14: saṅkā: from sac, to be assembled or sam, with; kṛ, to be renowned, armies in which there are assembled, or celebrated warriors
