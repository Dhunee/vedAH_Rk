## English translation:

“May the **brāhmaṇas**, the progenitors presenters of the **Soma**, the observers of truth, protect us; may the faultless heaven and earth be propitious to us; may **Pūṣan** preserve us from misfortune, let no calumniator prevail over us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The observers of truth: ṛtāvṛdhaḥ **rakṣā**: of deities, **deva**, rakṣatasmān, protect us;

**Rakṣa** = rakṣata
