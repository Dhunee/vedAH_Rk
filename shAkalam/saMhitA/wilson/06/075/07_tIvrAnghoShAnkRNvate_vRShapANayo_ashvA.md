## English translation:

“The horses raising the dust with their hoofs, rushing on with the chariots, utter loud neighings, retreating not (from the charge), but trampling with their fore feet upon the enemies, they destroy them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The horses raising: vṛṣapāṇayo **aśvaḥ** = pāṃsunām varṣakakhura, with hoofs the showerers of dust;

**Aśvavāra** = riders: vṛṣab **aśvāḥ** haste yeṣām te **aśvavāraḥ**; this is the nominative native of kṛṇvate ghoṣān, calling out, **jaya**, jaya; āśeva, the horses make a noise; heṣādi śabdān, neighing, and the like
