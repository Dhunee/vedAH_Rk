## English translation:

“The arrow puts on a (feathery) wing; the (horn of the) deer is its point; it is bound with the sinews of the cow; it alights where directed; whenever men assemble or disperse, there may the shafts fall for an advantage.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Deer is its poit: mṛgo asyā **danta**: the deer is its tooth; i.e. the horn of the deer; or, **mṛga**, an adjective, that which seeks or reaches the enemy (**Nirukta** 9.19); with the sinews of the cow: **gobhiḥ** sannaddha = govikāraiḥ snāyubhiḥ, with tendons derived from the cow
