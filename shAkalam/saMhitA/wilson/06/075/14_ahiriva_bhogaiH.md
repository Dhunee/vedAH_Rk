## English translation:

“The ward of the fore-arm protecting it from the abrasion of the bow-string, surrounds the arm like a snake with its convulutions; may the brave man, experienced in the arts of war, defend a combatant on every side.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hastaghna = a shield, as well as the guard of the fore-arm; with its convolutions: ahiriva bhogaiḥ = śarīrena, with the body
