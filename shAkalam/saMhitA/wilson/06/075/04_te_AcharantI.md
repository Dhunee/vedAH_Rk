## English translation:

“May the two extremities of the bow, acting in concert, like a wife sympathizing (with her husband), uphold (the warrior), as a mother nurses her child upon her lap; and may they, moving concurrently, and harassing the foe, scatter his enemies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a wife: bibhṛtām = rājānam dhārayetām; or, dhārayatām **samam**, support the arrow; samaneva **yoṣā** (a singular used for the dual), the two extremities drawing close to the archer, like two women to their lover, stiyau yathā kāntam āgacchataḥ
