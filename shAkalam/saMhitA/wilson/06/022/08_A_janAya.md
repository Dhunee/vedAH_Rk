## English translation:

“Make hot the regions of earth, of heaven, of mid air, for the oppressive race (of the **rākṣasas**); showerer (of benefits), consume them everywhere with your radiance, make the heaven and the firmament (too) hot for the impious.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Brahmadviṣe = **brāhmaṇa** dveṣṭre, the hater of **brāhmaṇas**; perhaps, a reference to the enemy or hater of the **veda** or of prayer
