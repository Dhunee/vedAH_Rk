## English translation:

“Self-invigorated **Indra**, you have crushed by your knotted (thunderbolt), quick as thought, that **Vṛtra**, growing in strength by this cunning; very radiant and mighty (Indra), you have demolished by (your) irresistible (shaft) the unyielding, compact, and strong (cities of the **asuras**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Growing in strength: ayā māyayā vāvṛdhānam, by this guile or deception
