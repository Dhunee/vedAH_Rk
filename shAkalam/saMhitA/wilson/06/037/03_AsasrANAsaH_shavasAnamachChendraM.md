## English translation:

“May the everwhere-going, straight-proceeding, chariot-bearing seeds, bring the mighty **Indra** uin his strong-wheeled car to our rite; let not the ambrosial **Soma** waste in the wind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soma, it is said, if allowed to remain some time in the vessel containing it, may be dried up the air; Indra is therefore urged to drink it before it dries up
