## English translation:

“Whom, therefore, we all, who are the profferers and bestowers of praise ever commend, as the pious Bṛbu, the donor of thousands (of cattle), the receiver of thousands (of laudations).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛbu is called Takṣā the carpenter or artificer of the **Paṇis**; the legend is preserved by **Manu** (10.107) and **Nīti** **Mañjarī**: the illustrious **Bharadvāja**, with his son, distressed by hunger in a lonely forest, accepted many cows from the carpenter Bṛbu; the ṛca is attributed to **Sayu**, the son of Bharadvāja; jātito hino api dātṛtvāt **sarvatra** śreṣṭho **bhavati**, a person n inferior by caste becomes everywhere distinguished by genitive rosity
