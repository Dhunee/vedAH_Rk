## English translation:

“Drink, **Indra**, (the **Soma**) that is effused for your exhilaration; stop your friendly steeds; let them loose; sitting in our society, respond to our hymns; give food to him who lauds and worships you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sitting in our society: uta pra **gāya** gaṇe ā niṣadya: pragāya = asmābhiḥ kṛtam stotram upaślokaya, return verses to the praise made by us
