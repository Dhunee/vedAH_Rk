## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, who are all-pervading, be a friend, and a protector with irreproachable protections for our prosperity; when warring in number-thinning conflicts, we invoke you for the acquisition of wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When warring: yudyanto nemadhitā pṛtsu: **nema** = **ardha**, a half; or, some, katipayāḥ **puruṣā** dhīyanta eṣu, in those battles, pṛtsu, in which some men are engaged or killed;

Nemadhitā = nemadhitayā; for the acquisition of wealth: svaraṣātā = suṣṭhu araṇīyam dhanam tasya sambhaanārtham, very precious wealth for the sake of enjoying it, that is, by the spoils of the enemy
