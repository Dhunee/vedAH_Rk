## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, now and at (all) other times be verily ours; be the bestower of happiness according to our condition; and in this maner, worshipping at dawn, and glorifying you, may we abide in the brilliant and unbounded felicity of you who are mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Worshipping at dawn: goṣatamā = **vartamānā** bhavema, may we be present;

Ṣyama = may we be, may we abide;

**Goṣa** = the dawn
