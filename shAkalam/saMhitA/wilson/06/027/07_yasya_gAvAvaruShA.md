## English translation:

“He whose bright prancing horses, delighted with choice fodder, proceed between (heaven and earth), gave up **Turvaśa** to **Sṛñjaya**, subjecting the Vṛcīvats to the descendant of Devavāta (Abhyāvartin).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sṛñjaya: there are several princes with this name in the **purāṇas**; one of them, the son of **Haryaśva**, was one of the five **Pāñcāla** princes; the name is also that of a people, probably in the same direction, the northwest of **India**, or towards the **Punjab** (**Viṣṇu** Purān.a)
