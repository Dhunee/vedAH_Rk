## English translation:

“**Indra**, the invoked of many, thirty hundred mailed warriors (were collected) together on the Yavyāvatī, to acquire glory, but the Vṛcīvats advancing in a hostile manner, and breaking the sacrificial vessels, went to (their own) annihilation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thirty hundred: triṃśac chatam varmiṇaḥ = triṃśada dhikaśatam, one hundred and thirty; kavacabhṛtas, wearers of breasplates or armour;

Yavyāvatī = same as hariyūpīya
