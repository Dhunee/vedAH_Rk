## English translation:

“Drink it, **Indra**, you who enjoy the flavourless **Soma**; you who are the preserver, the handsome-chinned, the showerer (of benefits) on those who praise you; who are the breaker of mountains, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the curber of steeds, do you bestow upon us various food.”
