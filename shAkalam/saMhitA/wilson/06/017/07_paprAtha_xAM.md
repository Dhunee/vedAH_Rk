## English translation:

“You have filled the wide earth, **Indra**. With (the power of) your deeds; you, the mighty one, have propped up the vast heaven; you have sustained the heaven and earth, whose children are the gods, (and who are) the old and mighty parents of sacrifice.”

The old and mighty: pratne mātarā yahvir ṛtasya = the ancient parents, the offspring or **Brahmā**; ṛtasya, **brahmaṇa** yahvi purtyau yahu = **Āpatya** (Nighaṇṭ.u 2.2)
