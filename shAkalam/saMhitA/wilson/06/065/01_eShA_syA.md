## English translation:

“This heaven-born daughter (of the sky), driving away the darkness for us, makes visible human beings; she who with bright lustre is perceived dissipating the glooms, and (extinguishing) the plural nets (shining) in the nights.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Makes visible: udgirati **mānuṣīḥ** **prajāḥ** = vomits them, i.e., brings them up out of darkness into light; in the nights: rāmyāsu = yāmyāsu, rātriṣu
