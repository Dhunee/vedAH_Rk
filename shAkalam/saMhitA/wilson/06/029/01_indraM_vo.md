## English translation:

“Your priests, (oḥ worshippers), proppitiate **Indra** for his friendship, offering great (praise), and desirous of his favour; for the wielder of the thunderbolt is the giver of vast (wealth); worship him, therefore, who is mighty and benevolent, (to obtain) his protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Offering great praise: maho yantaḥ sumataye cakānāḥ = **mahat** **karma** anutiṣṭhantaḥ, performing great worship; stutim śabdāyantaḥ, uttering praise
