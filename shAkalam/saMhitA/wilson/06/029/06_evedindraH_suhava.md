## English translation:

“Thus may the mighty **Indra** be successfully invoked; he, the azure-chinned, the giver of wealth, whether by coming or not coming (to the sacrifice); and may he who is of unequalled strength destroy, as soon as manifested, many opposing (evil spirits) and (hostile) **Dasyus**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The azure-chinned: hiriśipra = **haritavarṇaḥ** śipro yasya, he whose chin or nose is of a green colour, an allusion perhaps to the sky, considered as a feature of Indra; whether by coming or not coming: ūti anūti = āgamanena anāgamanena, by coming or not coming; svayam āgato anāgato api stotṛbhyo dhanam prayacchati, whether he may have come himself or not, he gives wealth to the praisers
