## English translation:

“They offer adoration at your feet to acquire prosperity, for you are the overthrower of enemies by (your) strength, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the bestower of donations; leader (of rites), you are like the rolling sun, wearing in the sight (of all) a graceful and ever moving form.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vasāno atkam surabhim = satatagamanaśīlam praśastam rūpam sarveṣām darśanārtham ācchādayan, putting on, for the sake of the seeing of all, an excellent form endowed with perpetual movement
