## English translation:

“No limit of your strength has been assigned; heaven and earth are intimidated by its greatness; the pious worshipper, hastening (to sacrifice), and earnestly performing worship, gratifies you with the offering, as (the cow-keeper satisfies) the herds with water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ūti = ūtya, i.e. tarpakena haviṣā, with the satisfying oblation
