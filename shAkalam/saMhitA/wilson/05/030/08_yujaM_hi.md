## English translation:

“Verily you have made me, **Indra**, your associate when grinding the head of the slave **Namuci** like a sounding and rolling cloud; and the heaven and earth (have been caused) by the **Maruts** (to revolve like a wheel).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a sounding and rolling cloud: aśmānam cit svaryam vartamānam: the first two are rendered megham iva, like a cloud
