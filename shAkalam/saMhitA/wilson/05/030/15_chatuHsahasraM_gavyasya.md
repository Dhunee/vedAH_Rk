## English translation:

“We have accepted, **Agni**, the four thousand cattle from the **Ruśamās**; and the glowing, the golden ewer prepared for the solemnity, we who are wise have accepted it.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The golden ewer: **gharmas**' cit **taptaḥ** pravṛje ya āsid ayasmayaḥ: ayasmayaḥ = made of metal, here, made of gold, hiraṇyamaya **kalaśa**, a ewer;

Gharmaścit = **mahāvīra** iva, that is, like the ewer or vessel so termed, containing a mixture of **Soma**, melted butter, and milk, perhaps put upon the fire: yad ghara ityatapat tad gharmasya gharmatvam it **śruti**
