## English translation:

“When the libation is offered, **Indra**, we celebrate your exploits; those (exploits) which you have been praised (to achieve) for us; let him who is ignorant acquire knowledge (of them); let him who is acquainted (with them) make them known; this **Maghavan** (is) the lord of hosts.”
