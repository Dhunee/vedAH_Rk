## English translation:

“The slave (**Namuci**) made women his weapons what will his feminine le hosts do unto me? The two his best beloved, (**Indra**) confined in the inner apartments, and then went forth to combat against the **Dasyus**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

What will his feminine le hosts do unto me? Indra is supposed to say this; the two his best beloved: decapitation of Namuci by Indra is related in the **gadā** section of the **Śalya parva** of the **Mahābhārata**; Namuci through fear of Indra, took refuge in the solar rays; Indra promised that he would not harm him if he came forth, but broke his promise, and, on Namuci's issuing forth, cut off his head; by this he incurred the guilt of brahmanicide, for, Namuci was a **brahman**, but Indra was taught expiation of his sin by **Brahmā**
