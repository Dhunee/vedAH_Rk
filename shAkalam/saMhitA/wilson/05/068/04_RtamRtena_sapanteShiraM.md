They favour the zealous worshipper: ṛtam ṛtena sapanta iṣiram dakṣam āśāte = **udakena** nimittena yajñam spriśantau eṣanavantam pravṛddham yajamānam havir vā vyāpnutaḥ, they two, for the sake of water touching or affecting the sacrifice, they pervade the inquiring, powerful instrumental tutor of the rite, they reward him; or, it may be, they pervade or accept the efficacious, adequate oblation.
