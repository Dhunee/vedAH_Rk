## English translation:

“Offer praise to the company of the **Maruts**, the self-irradiating, the precipitators of mountains; present liberal oblations to the assuagers of heat, to those who come from the sky, to whom solemn rites are familiar, to the givers of abundant food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To whom solemn rites are familiar: pṛṣṭhayajvane: by whom the sacrifices called **pṛṣṭha** are made, these are said to be six, of which two are specified: **rathantara** and **bṛhat**, śatpṛṣṭhaiḥ rathantara bṛhadādibhir ijānāya
