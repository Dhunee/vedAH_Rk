## English translation:

“This wide-extended earth is for the **Maruts**; the spacious heaven is for the spreading winds; the paths of the firmament are provided (for their course); for them the expanding clouds quickly bestow (their gifts).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This wide-extended earth: pravatvatī **pṛthivī**: pra-vat, having extent, extension;

Vat = again, having or possessing;

Pravatvat = extensive; or, may imply having pre-eminence; or, tat-para, being subject to it, as the earth is subject to the Maruts, or they pervade the whole earth, kṛtsnam bhūmim vyāpnuvant; so the heaven is pravatvatī, spacious or subject to the pravats, pravatbhyaḥ the pre-eminent of spreading Maruts
