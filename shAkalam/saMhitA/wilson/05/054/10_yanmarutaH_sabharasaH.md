## English translation:

“**Maruts** of combined strength, leaders of the universe, guides of heaven, when the sun has risen you rejoice (in the **Soma** beverage), then your rapid steeds know no relaxation, but quickly you reach the limits of this road (to the sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Leaders of the universe: svarṇaraḥ = sarvasya netāraḥ, leaders of all; divo **naraḥ** = leaders of heaven
