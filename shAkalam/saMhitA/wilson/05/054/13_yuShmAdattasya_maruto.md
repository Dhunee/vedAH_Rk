## English translation:

“May we, who are possessed of chariots, intelligent **Maruts**, become (proprietors) of wealth, comprising food bestowed by you; of wealth that vanishes not, as **Tiṣya** (declines not) from the sky; therefore, Maruts, gratify us with infinite (riches).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tiṣya: = **Āditya**; it is the eighth lunar mansion
