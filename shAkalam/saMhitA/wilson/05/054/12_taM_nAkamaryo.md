## English translation:

“**Maruts**, when moving, you agitate the heaven of unchecked radiance, and (stir) the bright water; when you combine your energies and are shining brilliantly, and when purposing to send down rain, you utter a loud shout.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

And stir the bright water: the text changes the person n of the verb, yat svaranti ghoṣam, when they sound a noise; i.e. when the Maruts make a fearful noise, or when the worshippers utter loud praises
