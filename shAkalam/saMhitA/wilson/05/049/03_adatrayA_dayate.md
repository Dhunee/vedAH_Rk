## English translation:

“**Pūṣan**, **Bhaga**, **Aditi** bestow (severally) excellent viands; the fierce (sun) robes (himself with radiance); the good-looking (deities), **Indra**, **Viṣṇu**, **Varuṇa**, **Mitra**, **Agni**, give birth to happy days.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bestow excellent viands: adatrayā dayate vāryāṇi: adatrayā = adanīyāni, eatables; Agni consumes excellent consumable timbers, varaṇīyāni kāṣṭhāni dahate; the other terms are epithets: nourishing, the desirable, the uninjurable Agni
