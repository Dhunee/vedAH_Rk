## English translation:

“May ample wealth devolve upon those who have presented victims to the **Vasus**, and upon those who have repeated praises to **Mitra** and **Varuṇa** confer upon them, (gods), felicity, and may we rejoice in the protection of heaven and earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Presented victims to the Vasus: pra ye vasubhya īvadā **namaḥ**: īvadā namaḥ = gamanavad annana, food having motion, that is paśvātmakam, the same with animals
