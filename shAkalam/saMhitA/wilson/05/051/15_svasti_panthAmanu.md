## English translation:

“May we ever follow prosperously our path, like the sun and the moon; may we be associated with a requiting, grateful and recognisant (kinsman).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Punardadatā aghnatā jānatā = with one who gives again, one who does not kill or harm, i.e., one who not make an evil return to kindness, one who is grateful (one who does not inflict injury by long-suspended anger);

Jānatā = by one knowing, one who does not cut an old acquaintance, madhiyas' cirakālam **gataḥ** ko **ayam** iti sandeham akurvatu, by one who does not feel any doubt, saying, whos is this of mine that has been long since gone away; all these apply to bandhujana, a kinsman: bandhujanena saṅgamemahi
