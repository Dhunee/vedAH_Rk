## English translation:

“He whose fire is kindled, whose sacred grass is strewn, offers worship; he whose stone is uplifted, whose **Soma** juice is effused, offers praise; the priests, of whom the stones utter the sounds of bruising, descends with the oblation (for previous ablution) to the stream.”
