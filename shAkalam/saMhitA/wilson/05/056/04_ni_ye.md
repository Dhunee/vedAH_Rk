## English translation:

“They who with ease destroy (their foes) by their prowess, like horses difficult to be restrained, they send down by their movements the vast and sounding water-laden cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like horses: the text has **gāvaḥ**; the translation is **aśvaḥ**, horses
