## English translation:

“At whose worship (the priests) pour the dripping (butter) upon the flames, and (the drops) mount upon the fire as if they were its own numerous offspring, as (boys ride) upon the back (of a father).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Bhūmā** pṛṣṭheva = liṭ, likemany or much on the back; **bahu** bhavatiti bhūmā apatyam; **pṛṣṭha** implies the back of the father, pituḥ pṛṣṭo deśān iva, as boys mount upon the fathers' side, so do the flames, **putra** yathā pituraṅkam ārohanti tad vat
