## English translation:

“Bright as an axe is he to whom the (worshipper), like **Atri**, proceeds (to offer worship); he whom his prolific mother has brought forth, bestowing (a benefactor on the world), when (**Agni**) obtains (sacrificial) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bright as an axe: **śuci** sma yasmā atrivat pra svadhītīva rīyate: the comparison may apply to the worshipper, eager to offer an oblation as an axe to cut; may also apply to Agni;

Atri = an eater, or devourer, or an animal eating grass; atrivat may apply to the **yajamāna**
