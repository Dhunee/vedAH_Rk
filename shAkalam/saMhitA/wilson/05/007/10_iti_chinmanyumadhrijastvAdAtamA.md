## English translation:

“May the sage who is in this manner the offerer of exclusive praise (**Agni**, to you), accept the cattle which are to be given to you; and thereupon may **Atri** overcome (hostile) men.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May iṣa overcome hostile men: iṣaḥ sāsahyān nṛn: iṣaḥ = ṛṣi of the **sūkta**; or, derived from is. and being the accusative ative plural ral, may be an epithet of nṛn, encountering or opposing men
