## English translation:

“The many-necked, the showerer (of benefits), ever increasing, collects together the wealth of the enemy without opposition; the immortals have enjoined **Agni** that he will bestow happiness on the man who offers sacrifice; that he will bestow happiness on the man who offers oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That he will bestow happiness: barhiṣmate manave **śarma** yaṃsat is repeated with a slight variation of the first word, haviṣmate
