## English translation:

“I have seen him passing secretly from plural ce (to plural ce) like a herd (of cattle), shining brightly of his own accord; they apprehended not those (flames of his), but he has (again) been born, and they who had become grey-haired are (once more) young.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Passing like a herd of cattle: going from pasture to pasture; grey-haired are young: paliknīr id yuvatayobhavanti: the flames which had so often produced may be considered as aged;or liṭ, grey-headed; or, an allusion is intended to the suspension of the functions of fire, as in the legend
