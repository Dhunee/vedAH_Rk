“Or may the goddesses, the wives of the gods, accept (the offering); **Indrāṇī**, **Agnāyī**, the radiant **Aśvinī** **Rodasi**, **Varuṇāni**, may each hear (our prayer); may the goddesses partake (of the oblation); may the (person nified) season of the wives of the gods, accept it.”

Rodasi: wife of **Rudra**; earlier, she had been referred to as the bride of the **Maruts**; may the goddesses partake: vyantu **devīḥ**, may the goddesses eat (**Nirukta** 12.46); the seacon of the wives of the gods: ya ṛtur janīnām that which is the time of the wives of the gods, that is, the goddesses presiding over it: yo devajayanam kālastadabhimāna devyaḥ
