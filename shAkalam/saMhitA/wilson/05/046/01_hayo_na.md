## English translation:

“The sage, (**Pratikṣatra**), has, of his own accord, attached himself to the burden (of sacrifice), like a horse (to a chariot); I support that transcendent and preservative load; I do not desire release from it, nor yet its reiterated imposition; the sage, going first, conducts (men) by the right path.”
