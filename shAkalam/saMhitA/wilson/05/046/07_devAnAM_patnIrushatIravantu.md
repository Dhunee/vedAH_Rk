## English translation:

“May the wives of the gods, desiring (our homage), defend us; may they so protect us that (we may obtain) vigorous (offspring) and abundant food; whether terrestrial, or those in charge of the waters (in the firmament), do you, goddesses, earnestly invoked, bestow upon us felicity.”
