## English translation:

“If, **Varuṇa**, we have ever committed an offence against a benefactor, a friend, a companion, a brother, a near neighbour, or, Varuṇa, a dumb man, remove it from us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Benefactor a friend: aryamyam mitryam vā = **aryaman** and **mitra**, the final ya being plural onastic; the first is **dātrī** a giver; **guru**, a spiritual preceptor; a dumb man: varuṇāraṇam vā; the **pada** separates the word into varuṇa and araṇam;

Araṇam = aśabdam, not having sound or speech, or adātāram, not giving, niggardly
