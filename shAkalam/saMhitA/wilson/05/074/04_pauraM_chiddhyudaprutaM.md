## English translation:

“**Pauras**, send to **Paura** the rain-shedding cloud drive it to him who is engaged in sacrifice, as (hunters chase) a lion in a forest.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Paura: pauram cid udaprutam paura paurāya jinvathaḥ: the name of the ṛṣi is applied to the **Aśvins**,because they are in relation with Paura as the author of the **sūkta**;

Paura = Aśvins;

Pauram = a cloud, being solicited by the ṛṣi for the fall of rain;

Paurāya = to me the ṛṣi so called; aṣ..a lion in a forest: siṃham iva druhaspade: druhaspade = a plural ce of difficult access, a thicket; yathā balād cyāvayanti śurāḥ, as heroes hurl down a lion by their strength
