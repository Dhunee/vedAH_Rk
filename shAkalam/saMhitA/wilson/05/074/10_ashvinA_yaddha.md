## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, wherever you may be, hear this invocation; the excellent sacrificial offerings, longing for your proximity, reach you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The excellent sacrificial offerings: vasvīr ū ṣu vām **bhujaḥ** pṛñcanti su vām pṛca : vasvīr bhujaḥ = praśasyāni dhanāni havirlakṣaṇāni, excellent offerings;

Pṛñcanti = prāpnuvanti, obtain or reach being pṛcaḥ; yuvam prāptum kāmayamānāḥ, desiring to reach you;

Alternative: the worshippers, su pṛcaḥ, who enjoy vasvīr bhujaḥ, wealth of sacrificial offerings, bring them into due contact with you, vām suṣṭhu saṃparcayanti
