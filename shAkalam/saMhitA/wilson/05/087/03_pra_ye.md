## English translation:

“Evayāmarut, glorifies with praise those who, (coming) brilliant and happy from the vast heaven, hear (his invocation); in whose dwelling there is no one able to disturb them, and who, like self-radiant fires, are the impellers of the rivers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In whose dwelling thereis: na yeṣām iri sadhasthe iṣṭe = **marutam** svakīye nivāse tiṣṭhatām **preritā** na iṣṭe na iṣṭate cālayitum, there is no impeller who has power to cause the movement of the **Maruts** when abiding in their own abode; impellers of the rivers: i.e., lightning as associated with rain, may be considered as giving impulse to the rivers
