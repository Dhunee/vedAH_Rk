## English translation:

“Evayāmarut glorifies those who are manifested with the great (**Indra**), who appear spontaneously and speedily with the knowledge (that the sacrifice is prepared); your strength in action, **Maruts**, is not to be resisted, (though qualified) by (your) infinite liberality; you are immoveable as mountains.”
