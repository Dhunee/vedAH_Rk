## English translation:

“Let not the sound (of your approach, **Maruts**), which is mighty, the announcer of rain,t he shedder of light, diffusive, loud, alarm Evayāmarut; that sound wherewith, overcoming (your foes), you who are self-irradiating, lasting-rayed, ornamented with golden oranaments, self-weaponed, bestowing food, accomplish your functions.”
