## English translation:

“**Maruts**, devoid of enmity, come to our proffered praise, hear the invocation of your adorer, Evayāmarut; do you, who are associated in the worship of **Viṣṇu** drive away, as warriors (scatter their enemies), our secret foes.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viṣṇu = **Indra**
