## English translation:

“May the voice-born praises of Evayāmarut reach you, **Viṣṇu**, attended by the **Maruts**; (may they reach) the strong, the adorable, the brilliantly-adorned, the vigorous, praise-loving, cloud-scattering, quick-moving company of the Maruts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viṣṇu attended by the Maruts: viṣṇave marutvate: viṣṇave is an adjective to the pervading, vyātāya, i.e. **Indra**, of whom Marutvat is a designation;

Alternative: viṣṇave vā, or to Viṣṇu\] \[This **sūkta** is attributed to ṛṣi evayāmarut; this is perhaps an epiithet of the Maruts
