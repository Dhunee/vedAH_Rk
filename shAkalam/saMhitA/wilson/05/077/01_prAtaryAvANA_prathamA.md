## English translation:

“Worship the two who come first (of the gods) at dawn; let them drink before the greedy withholders (of the offering); for the **Aśvins** verily claim the morning sacrifice; the ardent sages praised them (at dawn).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ancient sages: kavayaḥ pūrvabhājaḥ: **kavi** = one learned in the **Vedas**: ye ve anucānas te kavayaḥ, those are anucānas are **kavis** (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**);

Anucāna = ṣadaṅgasahita vedadhyāyinaḥ, students of the Vedas with the six supplements
