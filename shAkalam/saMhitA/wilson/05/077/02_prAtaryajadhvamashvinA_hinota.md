## English translation:

“WOrship the **Aśvins** at early dawn; offer their oblations; the evening is not for the gods; it is unacceptable to them; and whether it be any other than ourselves who worship them or propitiates them, the worshipper who is foremost (in his devotion) is the most approved of.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The evening is not for the gods: Purvāhṇo vai devānām, the forenoon verily is for the gods
