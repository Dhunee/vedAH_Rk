## English translation:

“Wonderful **Indra**, wielder of the thunderbolt, since precious treasure is to be distributed by you, bestow it, possessor of riches, with both **hands**, upon us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Since precious treasure is to be distributed by you: mehanāsti tvā dātam **rādhas** = maṃhanīyam dhanam tvayā dātavyam, praiseable wealth is to be given by you; another interpretation: mehanāsti = me iha **nāsti**, what is not in this world, or, on this occasion, mine (**Nirukta** 4.4)
