## English translation:

“Celebrate the divine **Agni** for his protection; may he who presides over dwellings grant (our desires); may the son of the ṛṣis, the observers of truth, save us from those who hate us.”

The son of the ṛṣis: Agni is termed the son of the ṛṣis, as genitive rated by their rubbing the sticks together which produce fire
