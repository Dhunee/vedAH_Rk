## English translation:

“Glorious, **Indra**, is your strength, exulting, immortal, and clothing (the world with light); do you give us riches, and brilliant wealth, and I will greatly praise the munificence of the opulent lord.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Exulting: nṛtamāna = liṭ, dancing, nṛtyam; brilliant wealth: enīm

Rayim = liṭ, white riches, perhaps a reference to silver
