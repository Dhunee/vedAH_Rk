## English translation:

“Inasmuch, **Indra**, as many praises are yours, therefore, combating for the sake of (shedding) water on fertile (lands), you have effected (the discomfiture of its obstructors); you, who are the showerer (of benefits), have on behalf of the sun, destroyed in his own dwelling the very name of (the **asura**), **Dāsa**, in battle.”
