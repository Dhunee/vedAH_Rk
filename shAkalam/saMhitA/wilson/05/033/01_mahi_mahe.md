## English translation:

“Feeble as I am, I offer praise to the great and vigorous **Indra**, for this purpose, (that he may grant) strength to (our) people; he who, associated with the **Maruts**, shows favour to this person n when praised for the sake of sustenance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Associated with the Maruts: samarya is an epithet of Indra; three explanations are offered for samarya: martyaiḥ, stotṛbhiḥ, sahitaḥ, together with mortals, that is, with worshippers, yuddhamānairmarudādibhiḥ, with the Maruts and other combatants, or **samara** **arhaḥ**, fir or suited to war
