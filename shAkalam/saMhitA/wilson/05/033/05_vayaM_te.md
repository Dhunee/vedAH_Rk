## English translation:

“We, **Indra**, are yours, and yours are they who are the leaders (of rites), promoters of (your) strength, and willing applicants (to you); all-powerful Indra, may adherents worthy of commendation and faithful, come to us, like **Bhaga**, in battles.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

All-powerful Indra: ahiśuṣma is an epithet of Indra, sarvato vyāptabala, of all-pervading strength; like Bhaga in battles: satvā bhago na **havyaḥ** prabhṛtheṣu **cāruḥ**: prabhṛta = war or sacrifice; hence, may a faithful folloer or ally, **sarva** bhṛtyādiḥ, come, like Bhaga, as an associate, **cāru** saṅgantā, tobe commanded, **havya**, in sacrifices, or defied, pratibhaṭairāhvātavya, in battles; as the divine Bhaga comes as our ally, so may followers and others come
