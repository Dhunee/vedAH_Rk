## English translation:

“Since, mighty **Indra**, those who, differing from us, and not united with you through their lack of devotion, are not yours; therefore, divine holder of of the thunderbolt, who are possessed of excellent horses, ascend the car, whose reins you guide, (to come to our sacrifice).”
