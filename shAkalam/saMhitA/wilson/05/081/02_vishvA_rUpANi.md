## English translation:

“The wise **Savitā** comprehends all forms (in himself); he has engendered what is good for biped and quadruped; the adorable Savitā has illumed the heaven, and shines in sequence to the passage of the Dawn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 13.3; savitā comprehends all forms in himself: **viśva** rūpāṇi pratimuñcate, he liberates, severally, all forms = ātmani badhnāti or dhārayati he binds or holds in himself; or,he makes all forms manifest in their own substance, by removing darkness; has illumed the heaven: nākam vyākhyat = svargam prakāśayati, he makes manifest **svarga** as the reward of the **yajamāna**
