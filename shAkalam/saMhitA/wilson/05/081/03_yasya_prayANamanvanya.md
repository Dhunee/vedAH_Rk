## English translation:

“After the passage of which divine (being) the other deities proceed to (obtain) majesty with power; he who by his greatness has measured out the terrestrial regions the divine **Savitā**, (is) resplendent.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 11.6; sa **etaśaḥ** savitā: etaśaḥ = etavarṇaḥ **śubhraḥ**, śobhamāna, white-coloured, bright, shining; or, etad, this world, and śete, who reposes in, who pervades; or, **etaśa** = a horse, hence, designating the sun
