## English translation:

“Augmenting the well-known and ample form (of man), in like manner as the sacred grass is preserved by prayer, do you, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, who are invigorated by (sacrificial) viands, and abound in food, ascend your car in the midst of the plural ce of sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Augmenting the well-known and ample form: śrutam amatim anuvardhād urvīm = viśrutam śarīradīptim anuvarddhayantau = augmenting the renowned bodily lustre; tad urvīm pālayantau; ascend your car: garte mitra āsāthe: **garta** = **ratha**, a car
