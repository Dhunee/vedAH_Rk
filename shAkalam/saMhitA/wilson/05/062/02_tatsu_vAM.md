## English translation:

“Exceeding is that your greatness, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, whereby the ever-moving sun has, through (succeeding) days, milked forth the stationary waters; you augment all the (world-illuming) rays of the self-revolving (sun); the one chariot of you two (perpetually) goes round.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The one chariot of you two gods round: vām ekaḥ pavir ā vavarta: **pavi** is the circumference of a wheel; a metonymy for the chariot; yuvayor eko ratho anukramaṇen ma paribhramate
