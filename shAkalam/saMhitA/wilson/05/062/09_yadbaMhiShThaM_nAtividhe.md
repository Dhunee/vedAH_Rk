## English translation:

“Munificent **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, protectors of the universe, (it is yours to grant) exceeding and perfect felicity, such as it is impossible to disturb; bless us with that (felicity), and may we ever be (possessed) of the riches we desire, and be confident of vicotry (over our enemies).”
