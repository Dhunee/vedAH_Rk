## English translation:

“I have beheld the permanent orb of the sun, your (dwelling plural ce), concealed by water, where (the hymns of the pious) liberate (his) steeds; where a thousand rays abide together; the one most excellent of the (embodied) forms of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His steeds: which are said to be attempted to be detained by a class of **asuras** termed **mandehas**; most excellent of the embodied forms of the gods: devānām śreṣṭham vapuṣam = the best of the embodied or light-possessing deities, i.e., of **Agni** and others, devānām vapuṣmatām tejovatām agnyādinām praśasyam; or, it may apply to the sun only, the **maṇḍala**, the orb, the visible form, as it were, of the sun, maṇḍalam hi sūryasya vapusthāniyam
