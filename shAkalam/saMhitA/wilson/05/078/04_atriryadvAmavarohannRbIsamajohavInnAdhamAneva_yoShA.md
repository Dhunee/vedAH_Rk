## English translation:

“Inasmuch as **Atri**, escaping by your aid from the fire of chaff, conciliates you, like a wife soliciting the affection of a husband, therefore come with (your) propitious cars; with the new-born rapidity of the falcon.”

Fire of chaff: the fire here is called ṛbīsam tuṣāgnim, a fire of chaff
