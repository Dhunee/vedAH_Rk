## English translation:

“The fierce **Indra** seized upon him, that vast moving (**Vṛtra**), when slumbering, (after) having drunk the **Soma**, subduing (his foes), and enveloping (the world), and then slew him with his great weapons in battle, footless, measureless, speechless.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Apādam amatram mṛdhravācam: amatram = aparimāṇam, without measure, or perhaps bulk
