## English translation:

“The wielder of the thunderbolt, the render of the rain-cloud, has destroyed with his bolt the mighty **Śuṣṇa**, the wrath-born (son) of the **Dānava**, the walker in darkness, the protector of there showering cloud, exhilarating himself with the food of these (living creatures).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The protector of the showerin gcloud: miho napātam = meghasya rakṣitāram **napāt**, here meaning pātā, a protector, a preserver, as in the **Brāhmaṇa** text cited: prāṇo vai **tanūnapāt** sa hi **tanvaḥ** **pāti**, vital air is called the body-preserver, for it preserves the limbs
