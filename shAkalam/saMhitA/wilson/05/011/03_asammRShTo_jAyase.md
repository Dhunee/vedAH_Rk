## English translation:

“You are born unobstructed of two mothers; pure, adorable, wise, you have sprung up from (the devotion of) the householder; they have augmented you with butter; **Agni**, to whom burnt-offerings are made, the smoke is your banner spread abroad in the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Born of two two mothers: the two sticks of attrition; you have sprung from the devotion of the householder: udatiṣṭho **vivasvataḥ**: the latter designates the **yajamāna**, from his especially, vi, abiding, vasata, in the chamber where the **agnihotra**, and other rites with fire are celebrated
