## English translation:

“Celebrate, (priests), the most prophetic of the prophets; imbue him with the sweet libation, and may the divine **Savitā** bestow upon us ample, beneficial and delightful riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The most prophetic of the prophets: kavitamam kavīnām: **kavi** = **krānta** dar'ī, a seer or shower of the past, whence may be inferred the application of his knowledge to the future
