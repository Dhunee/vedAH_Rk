## English translation:

“May the dexterous-handed, humble-minded artist (of the gods, the **Ṛbhus**); may the wives of the showerer (**Indra**); may the rivers carved out by **Vibhu**; may **Sarasvatī** and the brilliant **Rākā**, the illustrious granters of desires, be willing to grant us riches.”
