## English translation:

“May our most animating praise, together with our offerings, successfully attain **Varuṇa**, **Mitra**, **Bhaga** and **Aditi**; may the ministrant of the five (vital airs, **Vāyu**), the dweller in the dappled (firmament), he whose path is unimpeded, who is the giver of life, the bestower of happiness, hear.”
