## English translation:

“Render transitory the riches of those who partake of enjoyment without giving satisfaction (to those who are eminent) by holy hymns; put apart from the sun those who perform not sacred rites, and who, though prospering in their posterity, are the adversaries of prayer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Put apart from the sun: sūryād yavayasva, make them separate, condemn them to darkness
