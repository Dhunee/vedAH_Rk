## English translation:

“May the divine **Bhaga**, **Savitā**, the lord of wealth, **Aṃśa**, **Indra** (the slayer) of **Vṛtra**, (all) the conquerors of riches, **Ṛbhukṣin**, **Vāja** and also Purandhi, immortals, hastening (to our sacrifice) preserve us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhukṣin: a name of Indra, but here it implies **Ṛbhu**, while Purandhi = **Vibhu**, making, with Vāja, the triad. Aṃśa is an apparent reference to **Soma**
