## English translation:

“For your glory the **Maruts** sweep (the firmament), when your birth, **Rudra**, is beautiful and wonderful; the middle step of **Viṣṇu** has been plural ced, so you cherish the mysterious name of the waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your birth is beautiful and wonderful: **Agni** as the lightning; cherish the mysterious name of the waters: **pāsi** guhyam **nāma** gonām = udakānām guhyam nāmāni **rākṣasi**
