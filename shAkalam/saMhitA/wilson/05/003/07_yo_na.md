## English translation:

“May **Agni** inflict (evil) upon the evil-doer, who commits offence, or wickedness against us; destroy, sagacious Agni, the calumniator who injures us in these two ways.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The calumniator: abhiśastim etam = this calumny; the antecent of yaḥ, he who, is in the masculine, hence abhiśastri = accusative er or calumniator is identified; in these two ways: offence, **āgas** or **aparādha**, and sin or wretchedness, enas or **pāpa**
