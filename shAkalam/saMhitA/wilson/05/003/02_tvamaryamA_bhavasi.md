## English translation:

“You are **Aryaman** in relation to maidens; you bear, enjoy of sacrificial food, a mysterious name; they anoint you, like a welcome friend, with milk and butter, when you make husband and wife of one mind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You are Aryaman in relation to maidens: tvam **aryamā** yat kanīnām: as regulator of the ceremony the nuptial fire may be regarded as Aryaman; a mysterious name: that of **Vaiśvānara**, the friend of all, **viśva**, men, **nara**; with milk and butter: añjanti mitram sudhitam na **gobhiḥ**: gobbhiḥ: liṭ, with cows, used by metonymy for the products of the cow
