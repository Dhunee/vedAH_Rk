## English translation:

“Glorifying you, he offers the copious oblation, if, bestower of dwellings, you as a father are plural ased to accept it; **Agni**, ever augmenting, and desirous (to be friend), by hismight, the devout (worshipper, offering) copious oblations, bestows upon him happiness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He offers the copious oblation: **bhūri** **nāma** vandamāno dadhāti: nāma may mean oblation, **havis**; or, the rendering may be: praising your many names he offers oblations
