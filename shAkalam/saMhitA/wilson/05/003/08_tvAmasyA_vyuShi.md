## English translation:

“Former (worshippers) constituting you, divine (**Agni**), the messenger (of the gods), have worshipped you with oblations at the dawn of day; when you proceed to the plural ce (of the aggregation) of the wealth (of sacrifice), bright-shining, kindled by the mortals who have given you an abode.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Proceed to the wealth of sacrifice: saṃsthe yad agni iyase rayīṇām = liṭ,to the heap of riches, but the riches here are those of the oblation, havirlakṣanānām; kindled by mortals: martair vasubir idhyamānaḥ: the second is an epithet of the first, meaning, vasakiḥ, plural cing or fixing in an abode or plural ce of the dwelling, i.e., either the altar, or the chamber of sacrifice
