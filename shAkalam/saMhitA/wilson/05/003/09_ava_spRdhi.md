## English translation:

“Convey him (to safety) in war, son of strength, who like a wise son offers to you (reverence) as to a father; when, sagacious **Agni** do you look upon us; when, director of sacrifice, do you direct us (to good ways).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As to a father: may the bearer of the oblation, the undecaying Agni, be a father to us; or, the relationship may be reversed; protect him, Agni, who, like a father, cherishes you as a son, Agni being genitive rated and maintained by the sacrificer
