## English translation:

“May the seven times seven all-potent (**Maruts**, aggregated as) a single troop, bestow upon me hundreds (of cattle) may I possess wealth of cows, renowned upon the (banks of) the **Yamunā**; may I possess wealth of horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Upon the banks of Yamunā: yamunāyām **adhi** śrutam rādho gavyam: an extraordinary allusion anticipating **Gokula** of **Kṛṣṇa**
