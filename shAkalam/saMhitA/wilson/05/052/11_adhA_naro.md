## English translation:

“Now, leaders (of the rains), they support (the world); now, blending together, they bear (the oblation) now, situated remote, (they uphold distant objects); so may their manifold forms be manifest.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They uphold the distant objects: the text has only adhā parāvatā: the latter is formed from paravat, dūradeśaḥ, a distant plural ce or country, tat sambandhinaḥ being in relation to it; i.e., the winds being in the firmament give support to the distant stars and plural nets
