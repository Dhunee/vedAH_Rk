## English translation:

“I glorify that **Agni** who is the giver of dwellings; to whom, as to their home, the kine, the light-faced steeds, the constant offers of oblations, repair; do you, (Agni), bring food to your adorers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 15.41; to whom: yam astam yanti dhenavaḥ: astam = sarveṣām gṛhavad āśrayabhūtam, he who is become to house-like asylum of all;

Astam = gṛham
