## English translation:

“These your flames **Agni**, fed with abundant food, increase, as, by their descent, they seek the pastures of the hoofed cattle; bring, Agni, food to your adorers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They seek the pastures: ye patvabhiḥ śaphānām vrajā bhuranta gonām: ye raśmayaḥ, those rays which patanaiḥ by fallings, icchanti yūthāni śaphānām gonām, wish for or proceed to the herds of hoofed cattle; the spreading flames long for the burnt-offerings, **ayata** **jvālā** homāya kāṅkṣanti ityarthaḥ
