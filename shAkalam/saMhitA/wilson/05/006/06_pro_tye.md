## English translation:

“These fires cherish all that is precious in the fires (of sacrifice); they give delight; they spread abroad; they crave perpetually (sacrificial) food; bring, **Agni**, food to your adorers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

These fires cherish: pro tye agnayo agniṣu viśvam puṣyanti vāryam: prapuṣyanti **dhiṣṇyā** gārhapatyādiṣu, they nourish exceedingly, by their intensity, wealth dhanam (implied), in the household and other fires; i.e., the primary flames of Agni, when manifested in the household fires, are the source of riches
