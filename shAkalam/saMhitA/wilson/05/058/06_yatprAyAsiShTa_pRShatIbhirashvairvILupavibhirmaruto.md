## English translation:

“When, **Maruts**, you come with stout-axled cars drawn by spotted steeds, then the waters descend, the forests are damaged,a nd the bright showerer (of the rain), influenced by the solar rays, may emit a downward sound.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May emit a downward sound: avosriyo **vṛṣabhaḥ** krandatu **dyauḥ**: dyaur--vṛṣabhaḥ = the shining showerer, i.e., **Parjanya**, or **Indra**, in that capacity; usriyaḥ, in connection with the usra or rays of the sun, avakrandatu, avāṅgmukham śabdayatu, may sound with his face turned downwards, vṛṣyartham, for the sake of rain
