## English translation:

“Adore, priest, the resplendent and powerful company, whose arms (are decorated) with bracelets, whose function is the agitation (of the trees), who are wise, and by whom wealth is conferred; they who are bestowers of felicity, whose greatness is unbounded; glorify the opulent leaders (of rites).”
