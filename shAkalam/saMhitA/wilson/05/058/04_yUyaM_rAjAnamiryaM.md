## English translation:

“Adorable **Maruts**, you cause (a son) to be born to the man (who worships you), a ruler, an over-comer of foes, and modelled by Vibhvan; from you, Maruts, comes a valiant descendant, strong-fisted, mighty armed; from you (he acquires) an excellent steed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Modelled by Vibhvan: vibhvataṣṭam: vibhvān is the second of the **Ṛbhus**, a skilful artist; fabricated by him, implies very perfect or handsome, tena nirmitam atyantarūpavantam
