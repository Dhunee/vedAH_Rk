## English translation:

“Inasmuch as I who am a mortal earnestly invoke you who are an immortal, praising you with a devoted heart; therefore, **Jātavedas**, grant us food, and may I obtain immortality through my posterity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Immortality: an unbroken succession of descendants, amṛtatvam santatyaviccheda lakṣaṇam (amṛtatvam = tadu te partyāmṛtam : **Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.5.5.6); another text may be cited: prajām anu prajāyate tad u te martyamṛtam, when progeny is born after progeny, that verily is the immortality of your mortality
