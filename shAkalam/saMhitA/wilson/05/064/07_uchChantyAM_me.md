## English translation:

“Deities who are to be worshipped at the sacrifice to the gods, at the (first) shining ray (of light) at dawn; behold my **Soma** libation poured out; hasten, with rapid steeds, leaders (of rites), propitious to **Arcanānas**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With rapid steeds: hastibhiḥ padbhiḥ = liṭ, with **hands**, with feet, that is, wiḥ those having four feet, i.e. with horses
