“You hae arrested one luminous wheel of (your) car for illumining the form (of the sun), while with the other you traverse the spheres (to regulate) by your power the ages of mankind.”

You have arrested one luminous wheel: īrmā anyad vapuṣe vapuścakram rathasya yemathuḥ: īrma = rūpam, form;

Vapuṣe = ādityasya śobhāyai, for the beauty or lustre of the sun;

**Vapus** = **vapuṣmat**, having light or lustre, luminous as an epithet of cakram; the fixing of one wheel of the car of the **Aśvins** has been alluded to; the ages of mankind: nahuṣā **yugā** : **nahuṣa**, **manuṣya**, man;

**Yuga** = yugāni, metonymy for the divisions of time in genitive ral, as morning, noon, night, or the sacrifices offered at stated periods
