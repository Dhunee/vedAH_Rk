## English translation:

“Let not the **Rasa**, the Anitabhā, the **Kubhā**, or the wide-roving ocean delay you; let not the watery **Sarayu** oppose you; may the happiness of your (approach) be ours.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rasa, Anitabhā, Kubhā: names of rivers; the wide-roving ocean: **kramuḥ** **sindhuḥ** = **sarvatra** **kramaṇaḥ** **samudra**, the every-where going ocean
