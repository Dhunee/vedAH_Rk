## English translation:

“(The praise of them) who are all self-irradiating splendid in ornaments, in arms, in garlands, in breast-plural tes, in bracelets, in chariots, in bows.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In bracelets: khādiṣu; in an earlier text **khādi** = hasta tranaka, a guard for the **hand** or arm (RV. 1.23.43); here, it is explained as: hastapādasthita kaṭahāḥ = rings for the **hands** or feet,bracelets or anklets
