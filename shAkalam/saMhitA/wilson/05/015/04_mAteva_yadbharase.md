## English translation:

“When, everywhere predominating, you cherish all men like a mother, and (are implored by all) to behold and to support them; and when, being detained, you mature every kind of food, then, multiform (**Agni**), you comprise (all beings) in yourself.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You mature every kind of food: vāyo vayo jarase yad dadhānaḥ = yad dhāryamāno bhavasi **tadā** sarvam **annam** jarayasi, when you are being detained, then you cause all food to decay, i.e., to digest
