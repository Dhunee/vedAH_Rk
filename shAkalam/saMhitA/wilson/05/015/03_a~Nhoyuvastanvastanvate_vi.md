## English translation:

“They who (present) to the chief (of the gods) the great food (of sacrifice), unattainable (by the **rākṣasas**), enjoy forms exempt from defect; may that new-born **Agni** scatter assembled (hosts); let them stand from around me as (deer avoid) an angry lion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Enjoy forms exempt from defect: aṃhoyuvastanvas tanvate = svastanur aṃhasa viyojika vistārayanti, they effect the extension of their own person n, disjoined by or separated from sin
