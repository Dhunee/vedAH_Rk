## English translation:

“Divine, **Agni**, may the (sacrificial) food, the vast yielder (of benefits to men), the sustainer of riches, support the utmost of your vigour; and do you considering (the means of acquiring) great riches, like a thief keeping concealed the article (he has stolen), be propitious to **Atri**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a thief: the implication may be that wealth bestowed upon the ṛṣi is deposited in a secure receptacle, like the hidden booty of a thief, padam na tayur guham dadhānaḥ
