## English translation:

“These, your assembled (worshippers), who stand before you to distribute wealth, entertain towards us kindly intentions, offering unlimited riches; bright-born goddess, (who are) sincerely praised for (the gift of) horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

These your assembled worshippers: yaccid hi te **gaṇā** ime chadayanti maghattaye paricid vaṣṭayo dadhur dadato rādho ahrayam: maghattaye = dhanadānāya or dhanavattvāya, for giving or for possessing wealth; **pari** cid vaśtayo dadhuḥ = asmān eva kāmayamānaḥ parito dhārayanti, desirous of or being kind to us, they support us every way; dadato rādho ahrayam = giving wealth that is not to be wasted or taken away, or of which there is no need to be ashed; i.e. all they who, offering oblations, worship the dawn receive the reward for the benefit of us, or of me, that is, of the author of the hymn, ye tvam havir dadataḥ stuvanti te sarve apy asmadartham phalam dhārayanti
