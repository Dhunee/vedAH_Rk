## English translation:

“Radiant Uṣas, wake up today for (the acquisition of) ample riches, in like manner as you have awakened us (of old); bright-born, and praised sincerely for (the gift of) horses, show favour to **satyaśravas**, the son of **Vayya**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The concluding phrase is the refrain of the following verses: sujāte aśvasūnṛte: **sujātā**, well-born = śobhanaprādur **bhūta**, becoming manifest with splendour or light; aśvasunṛta, she whose praise for the sake of horses is affectionate and true, **svartha** priyasatyātmika stutivāk yasyāḥ sa
