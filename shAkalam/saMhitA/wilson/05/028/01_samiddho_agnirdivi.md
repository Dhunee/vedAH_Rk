## English translation:

“**Agni**, when kindled, spreads lustre through the firmament, and shines widely in the presence of the dawn; Viśvavārā, facing the east, glorifying the gods with praises, and bearing the ladle with the oblation, proceeds (to the sacred fire).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bearing the ladle with the oblation: haviṣā **ghṛtācī** = purodāśādilakṣaṇena yuktayā ghṛtācyā srucā sahitā, with the ladle of ghī connected with the cakes and other articles of the oblation;

Viśvavārā = feminine nine; the repeller of all enemies of the nature of sin, sarvam api pāparūpam śatrum varayitrī
