## English translation:

“May the accepter of the spiritless libation, the wilder of the thunderbolt, the showerer (of benefits), the overcomer of quick- (flying foes), the mighty, the monarch, the slayer of **Vṛtra**, the drinker of the **Soma**, having harnessed his horses, come down (to us); may **Indra** be exhilarated at the mid-day sacrifice.”
