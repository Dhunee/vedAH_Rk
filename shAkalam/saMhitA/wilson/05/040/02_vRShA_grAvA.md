## English translation:

“The stone is the showerer, the inebriation is the showerer, this effused **Soma** is the showerer; showerer (of benefits), **Indra**, utter destroyer of **Vṛtra**, come with the showering (**Maruts**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The showerer: either of the Soma juice, or the benefits derivable from offering it; here there is a plural y on the word **vṛṣā**
