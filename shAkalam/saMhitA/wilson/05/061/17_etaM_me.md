## English translation:

“Bear to Dārbhya, oḥ night, turning away (from me to him), this my eulogy (of the **Maruts**); convey my praises, goddess, as a charioteer (conveys the contents of his vehicle to their destination).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Oh night: upon concluding the praises of the Maruts and thus having attained the rank of a ṛṣi, **Śyāvāśva** summons the night, here called, Urmya, to convey the intelligence to **Rathavīti**, who gives him his daughter, with many valuable presents, but at the end of the ceremony the ṛṣi departd for the woods to resume his austerities
