## English translation:

“**Agni**, **Vaiśvānara**, who are deservedly praised and exaulted (by us), bestow happiness upon Tryaruṇa, who gives me hundreds (of **Suvarṇas**), twenty cattle and a pair of burden-bearing horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hundres of suvarṇas: the text has only śatāni, the hundreds; suvaṇānām is implied, of suvarṇas
