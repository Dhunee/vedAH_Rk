## English translation:

“**Agni** is awakened by the fuel (supplied) by the priests at the dawn, approaching like a cow (to pasture); his flames rise up to the sky like stately (trees) throwing aloft their branches.”

**Yajus**. 15.24; alternative explanations: **prati** **dhenu** āyatim uṣāsam = as the cow awakenedin the morning by the calf, and men by day-break; yahva iva pra vayam ujjihānaḥ = as large (birds) springing from the branches of the trees, or as the largest birds from their nests
