## English translation:

“Entitled to worship, he is worshipped in his own (abode); humble-minded, eminent among sages, our auspicious guest, the thousand-rayed, the showerer (of benefits), of well-known might, you, **Agni**, surpass all others in strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of well-known might: tad ojaḥ = liṭ, having that strength; tad, that, implying that which is notorious, yat prasiddham balam
