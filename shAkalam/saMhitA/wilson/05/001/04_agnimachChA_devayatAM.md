## English translation:

“The minds of the devout turn to **Agni**, as the eyes (of men) look towards the sun; when the multiform (heaven and earth) bring him forth along with the dawn, he is born as a white courser in the beginning of the days.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The multiform (heaven and earth): the text has virūpe, various-formed; it is applied to dyāvāpṛthivyau (implied)
