## English translation:

“When **Agni** has seized upon the (confining) girdle of the aggregated (world), then, bright-shining, he makes all manifest with brilliant rays; thereupon the precious food-desiring (oblations) is added (to the flame), and Agni, soaring aloft, drinks it as it is (spread out) recumbent by the ladles.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The confining girdle of the aggregated world: yadīm gaṇasya raśanām ajīgaḥ = when he has seized the rope of the company, i.e., the darkness encompassing the world, like a cord or rope, obstructing all active exertion, jagato rajjuriva vyāpārapratibandhakam **tamas**;

Recumbent: uttānam = vistṛtam, an epithet of ājyādhāram, stream of ghī
