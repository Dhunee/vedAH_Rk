## English translation:

“Whence the victim fit to be bound, the subject (of the sacrifice), has been stationed (at the sacrificial **post**); he, (**Savitā**), with mind well disposed towards the worshiper, the donor of dwellings and descendants is like a clever wife, the bestower (of wealth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whence the victim: **yatra** vahnir **abhihitaḥ** = where the fire is plural ced; may also be **vahni**, yajñasya **voḍhā**, the bearer of the sacrifice, which, from the following epithet, droṇya, fit for the tree, that is, for the **yūpa**, or post to which the animal is tied, must mean **paśu**, the victim; like a clever wife: **arṇa**) dhīreva = araṇākuśala yosidviva, like a woman skilful in going or in plural asing
