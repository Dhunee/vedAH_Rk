## English translation:

“Wherever you know, **Vanaspati**, the secret forms of the gods to be, thither convey the oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yatra** vettha devānām **guhyā** nāmāni: nāmāni = rūpāṇi, forms; it is not soecufued as a faculty of vanaspati in any preceding hymn to the āpris, although vanaspati, in the preceding hymns and also here represents **Agni**, as identified with the sacrificial **post**, or **yūpa**, or the deity presiding over the post: yūpābhimānī **deva**
