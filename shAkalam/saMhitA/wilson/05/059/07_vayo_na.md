## English translation:

“Like birds (that fly) in rows they pass along in their strength above the vast summit (of the sky) to the ends of the firmament; their horses have caused the waters of the cloud to descend, as both (gods and mortals) know.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Both gods and mortals: the text has only ubhaye yathā viduḥ, as both know; men of course know by perception the setting in of the rains; the gods know it by the **agrayāna** and other sacrifices which are offered at that season
