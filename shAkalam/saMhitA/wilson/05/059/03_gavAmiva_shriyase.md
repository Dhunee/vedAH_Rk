## English translation:

“You bear, for your decoration, an excellent (diadem) like the horn of cattle; as the sun, the eye (of day, dispenses light), so (are you diligent) in the distribution of the rains; graceful are you, and rapid as horses, and like (pious) mortals, you, leaders (of rites), consider (holy ceremonies) for their glory.”
