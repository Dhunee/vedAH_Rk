## English translation:

“The priest glorifies you, **Maruts**, for the good of the donor of the oblation; offer worship to the shining (heaven); I bring offerings to the earth; they, the Maruts, scatter the rapid (rain); they traverse the firmament; they combine their own radiance with (that of) the clouds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The priest: spas', nominative spat, for spraśta, one who touches the oblations, or the fire, an unusual term for the **Hotā**
