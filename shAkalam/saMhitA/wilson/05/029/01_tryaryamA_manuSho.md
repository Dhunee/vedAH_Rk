## English translation:

“In the adoration of the gods by **Manu** there are three effulgences, and they, (the **Maruts**), uphold three luminaries in heaven; the Maruts of pure energy worship you, for you, **Indra**, are their intelligent ṛṣi”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three luminaries: the sun, the wind, and fire; the same trio may be intended by the earlier phrase tryaryamā trīṇi aryamāṇi tejāṃsi
