## English translation:

“You have formerly detached one wheel (of the car) of **Sūrya**; another you have given to **Kutsa** wherewith to acquire wealth; with the thunderbolt you have confounded the voiceless **Dasyus**, you have destroyed in battle the speech-bereft (foes).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Confounded with voiceless dasyus: anāso dasyūn amṛṇaḥ: **anāsa** = asyarahitān, devoid or deprived of words, **asya**, face or mouth, being put by metonymy for **śabda**, the sound that comes from the mouth, articulate speech; Dasyus are also called amṛdhravācas = hiṃsita vāgindriyan = having defective organs of speech
