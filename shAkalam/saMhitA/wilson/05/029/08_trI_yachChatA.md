## English translation:

“When you had eaten the flesh of the three hundred buffaloes, when you who are **Maghavan** had drunk the three vessels of **Soma**, when he had slain Ahi, then all the gods summoned **Indra**, full of food, as if he had been a servant, to the battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When he had slain Ahi: or perhaps yad ahim jaghāna, that he should kill Ahi
