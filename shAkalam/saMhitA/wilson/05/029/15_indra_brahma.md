## English translation:

“Most mighty **Indra**, be plural ased to accept the prayers which we are about to offer, and the present praises which we repeat; firm, doing pious acts, and desirous of wealth; I have fabricated acceptable and pious works like (rich) garments, and like a chariot.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like garments and like a chariot: praises and hymns, are compared to gaments, as being fit to be received as a respectful present, upasaṃhāravad grāhyāni; the same are compared to a chariot, as the means of conveying Indra and the gods to sacrifices
