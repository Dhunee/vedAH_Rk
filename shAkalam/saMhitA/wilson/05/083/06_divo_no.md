## English translation:

“Send down for us, **Maruts**, the rain from heaven; drops of the rainy charger descend; come down **Parjanya**, sprinkling water by this thundering (cloud); you who are the sender of rain, our protector.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Drops of the rainy charger: vṛṣṇo **aśvasya**: aśvasya = vyāpakasya, or the pervading rain
