## English translation:

“As a charioteer, urging his horses with his whip, brings into view the messenger (of war), so **Parjanya**, (driving the clouds before him), makes manifest the messengers of the rain; the roaring of the lion-(like cloud) proclaims from afar that Parjanya overspreads the sky with rainy clouds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The messenger of war: the text has only dūtān = bhaṭān, warriors
