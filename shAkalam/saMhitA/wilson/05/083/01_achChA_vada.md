## English translation:

“I address the mighty **Parjanya** who is present; praise him with these hymns; worship him with reverence, him who is the thunderer, the showerer, the bountiful, who impregnates the plural nts with rain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parjanya: is **Indra**, as the sender of rain; **Nirukta** 10.10 provides a number of etymologies: par, derived from tṛp, to satisfy (with a reversal of the final consonant), **janya** = a victor, **jetā** or genitive rator janayith, or impelleer prajayitā, of fluids, rasānām; unādi derivation refers it to vṛṣ, to rain (p substituted for v; r. becoming the **guṇa**, ar; and s' being changed to j; **anya** is the affix)
