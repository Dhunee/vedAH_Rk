## English translation:

“The **Maruts** harness their easy-going chariot, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, for (the emission of) water, as a hero (harnesses his war-car); their forms traverse the different spheres to distribute the rain; do you, therefore, supreme rulers, shed upon us water from heaven.”
