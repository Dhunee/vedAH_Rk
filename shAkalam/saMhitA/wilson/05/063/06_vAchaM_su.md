## English translation:

“The cloud, (through your will), **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, utters a wonderful sound, indicative of radiance, and announcing (abundant) food; the **Maruts** thoroughly invest the clouds with (their) devices, and, (along with them), you two cause the purple and faultless sky to send down rain.”
