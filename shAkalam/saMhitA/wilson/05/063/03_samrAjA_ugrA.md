## English translation:

“Imperial and mighty showerers, lords of heaven and earth, beholders of the universe, you approach, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, with variegated clouds to hear the sound (of your praises), and cause the sky to (send down) rain by the power of the emitter of showers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the power of the emiter of showers: asurasya māyayā = **udaka** nirasituḥ parjanyasya sāmarthyena, by the power of **Parjanya**, the caster-forth of water, influenced by Mitra and Varuṇa as the deities presiding over day and night
