## English translation:

“These your friends, **Agni**, everywhere dispersed, were formerly unhappy (in abandoning your worship), but are again fortunate (by its renewal); may they who, with (censorious) words, impute fraudulent (practices) to me who pursue a straight path, bring eveil upon themselves.”
