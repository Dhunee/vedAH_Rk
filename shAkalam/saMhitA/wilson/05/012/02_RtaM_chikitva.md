## English translation:

“**Agni**, who know (the purpose of) the sacrifice, assent to this rite; be favourable to the copious showers of water; (endowed) with strength, (I undertake) not (to obstruct) sacred acts, nor adjure the rite with both (truth and untruth), but (repeate the praise) of the resplendent showerer (of benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Showers of water: ṛta = sacrifice, praise, truth, water; ṛtasya **dhārā** = water of the sacrifice; with both truth and untruth: nāham yātum **sahas** na dvayena ṛtam sapāmi aruṣasya vṛṣṇaḥ = liṭ, not I to go by strength, not by the two I swear, the sacrifice of the shining showerer; **yukta** is implied, i.e., joined or endowed **sahasa** with strength;

Yātum = to injure, or injury of pious acts; this word is connected with sapāmi, i.e. spṛśāmi or karomi, I touch or do; I do not proceed to injure sacred offices; by the two, the explanation is: satyānṛtabhyam, the truth and untruth, i.e. avaidikam kṛtyam na sap_mi, na karomi, I perform not any act not enjoined by the **Veda**; ṛtam here means praise, and is attached to sapāmi, i.e. I vow or repeat the praise of Agni.
