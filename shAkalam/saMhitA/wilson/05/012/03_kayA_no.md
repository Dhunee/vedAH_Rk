## English translation:

“**Agni**, bestower of water, by what (act of) truth may you, who are adorable, be cognizant of our adoration; may the divine Agni, the guardian of the seasons, recognize me; (I know) him not (yet) as the lord of the riches of which I am the possessor.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I know him not as the Lord: na aham patim sanituḥ **asya** **rāyaḥ** = bhajamānasya asya māma rāyaḥ svāminām tam agnim aham na jānāmi, I do not know that Agni, the master of the riches of this one, or me, the enjoyer
