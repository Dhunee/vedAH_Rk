## English translation:

“The dawn has come; the **Agni** of the season, blazing with the oblation has been plural ced (upon the altar); showerers of wealth, subduers of foes, your immortal chariot has been harnessed; masters of mystic lore, hear my invocation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Blazing with the oblation: ruśat **paśu** = blazing with the victim; but here, paśu = **raśmī**, a ray; or **haviṣ**, oblation
