## English translation:

“To me, when offering praise, as to an ancient author of sacred songs, the burden of the cloud (descends); the cloud parts (with its burden); the sky performs (its office); he assiduously worshipping **Aṅgirasas** are exhausted by much (adoration).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ancient author of sacred songs: mahīnām januṣe pūrvyāya = stūtinām utpādayitre pratnayā, to an ancient begetter or producer of praises; the cloud = the mountain, **parvata**
