## English translation:

“(**Indra**) recovered (the hidden cattle), hurling his thunderbolt from heaven at the prayers of the **Aṅgirasas**; the rays of the approaching dawn are spread around; the divine sun, scattering the clustered gloom, has risen and set open the doors of (the habitations of) men.”
