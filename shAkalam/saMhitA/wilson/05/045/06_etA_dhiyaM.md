## English translation:

“Come, friends, let us celebrate that solemn rite which was effectual in setting open the (secret) stalls of the (stolen) cattle; by which **Manu** overcame Viśiśipra; by which the merchant, going to the wood (for it), obtained the water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viśisipra: **manur** viśisipram jigāya = Manu conquered the enemy without a chin, or as **śipra** means also a nose, it might mean noseless; **Indra** and **Vṛtra** may be here intended; by which the merchant: **vaṇij** vaṅkur āpā purīṣam: an allusion to the legend of **kakṣīvān**
