## English translation:

“**Sūrya** has ascended above the glistening water, as soon as he has put to his bright-backed steeds; sage (worshippers) have drawn him, like a ship, across the sea; the waters hearing his commands, have come down.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sūrya has ascended: sūryo aruhat śukram **arṇas** = sūrya has mounted the bright water, that is, he has become everywhere visible, but it may be an allusion to the sun's rising apparently out of the sea
