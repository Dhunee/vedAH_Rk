## English translation:

“At this sacrifice the stone (set in motion) by the **hands** (of the priests) makes a noise, whereby the nine-months ministrants celebrated the ten-months worship; when **Saramā**, going to the ceremony, discovered the cattle, and **Aṅgiras** rendered all the rites effective.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ten-months worship: or, when the priests of both the nine and ten months rites offered worship;

Saramā: may signify either flowing, eulogistic, or sacred speech, śaraṇaśīlā stutirūpa vāk, or, as usual, the bitch of **Indra**
