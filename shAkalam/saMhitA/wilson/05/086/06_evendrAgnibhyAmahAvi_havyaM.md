## English translation:

“The invigorating oblation has been offered, like the **Soma**-juice expressed by the sounding stones; do you bestow food uponthe pious; great riches upon those who praise you; bestow food also upon those who praise you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the Soma juice expressed: ghṛtam na pūtam adribhiḥ: mention of the stones restricts the sense of ghṛtam to the Soma effusion
