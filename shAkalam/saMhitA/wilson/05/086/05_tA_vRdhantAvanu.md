## English translation:

“I adore you, irresistible deities for (the sake of obtaining) horses; you who are increasing day by day like mortals, who are worthy of worship, like two **Ādityas**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aṃseva: **aṃsa**' is the name of one of the twelve Ādityas, here putin the dual, **aṃśa** iva for any two; **aṃśu** also connotes **Soma**
