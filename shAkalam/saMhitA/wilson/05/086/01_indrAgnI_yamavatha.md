## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Agni**, the mortal whom you both protect scatters the substantial treasures (of his enemies), as **Trita** (fonfutes) the words (of his opponents).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vāṇīr iva **tritaḥ**: trita ṛṣi prativadavākyāni prabhinatti, as the ṛṣi Trita breaks or refutes controversial arguments or Trita may mean Agni, who, in the three regions, disregards or dissipates reproaches.
