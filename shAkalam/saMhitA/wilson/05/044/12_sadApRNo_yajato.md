## English translation:

“May Sadāpṛṇa, **Yajata**, Bahuvṛkta, Śrutavit, **Tarya**, associated with you, destoy, your foes; the ṛṣi obtains his desires in both (worlds), and shines brightly, whenever he adores with well-mingled (offerings and praises) the host (of heaven).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sadāpṛṇa... names of ṛṣis
