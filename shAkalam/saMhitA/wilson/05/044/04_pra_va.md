## English translation:

“These well-combined rays (of the sun) are descending with intent to proceed on the path (of the sacrifice), amplifiers of the ceremony for this (its instrumental tutor); operating with these swift-moving, all-regulating rays, he, (**Āditya**) steals the waters (that flow) in low plural ces.”
