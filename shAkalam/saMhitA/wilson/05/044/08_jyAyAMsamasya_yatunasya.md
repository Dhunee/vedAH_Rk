## English translation:

“The (pious man) proceeds to you, most excellent (of the gods, who are indicated) by the sign of this moving (revolution); who are hymned by the ṛṣis in whose praises youyr name (is glorified); he obtains that blessing by his devotion, on whatsoever (his desire) has been fixed; and he also, who of his own accord offers (worship) acquires abundant (reward).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the sign of this moving revolution: **asya** yatunasya ketuna is the text which is explained: karmaṇodayādi lakṣaṇena, characterized by functions such as rising and the like; he also...acquires abundant reward: ya u svayam vahate so aram karat = he who, not urged by another, entertains of his own mind the hope of reward, he does, much, or enough; atyartham **karoti** is one explanation; another is, atyartham kuryāt, let him do much, or enough
