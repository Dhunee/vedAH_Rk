## English translation:

“Swift is the excessive and girth-distending inebriation of Viśvavārā, **Yajata** and **Māyin**; (by drinking) of these (juices) they urge one another to drink; they find the copious draught the prompt giver of intoxication.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Swift iṣ..inebriation: **śyena** āsām **aditiḥ** kakṣyo **madaḥ**: śyena = **śīghra**, quick;

**Aditi** = atisamṛddhaḥ;

Āsām = of these, **Soma** juices;

**Mada** = intoxication, is the **devatā** of the verse
