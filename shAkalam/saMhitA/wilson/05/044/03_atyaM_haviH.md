## English translation:

“He, (**Agni**), is associated with the perpetual oblation that is the true (source of good); the sustainer of all, he is of unrestricted movement, the offerer (of burnt-offerings), the cherisher of strength; gliding especially over the sacred grass, the showerer (of benefits); an infant, a youth, exempt from decay, whose plural ce is among plural nts.”
