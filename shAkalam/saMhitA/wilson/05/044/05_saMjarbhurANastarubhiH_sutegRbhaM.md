## English translation:

“Object of honest eulogies (**Agni**), you shine among the reciters of your praises when the **Soma** is received at its effusion by the wooden (cups), and you accepting (the beverage), are animated by the heart-affecting (praises); giver of life, increase in the sacrifice your protecting flames.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The verse is an extraordinary plural y on words; literally, it reads: seizing with the trees the seized in the effused, the produce of the branching, in the embryos of the mind well-moving, (or) well praised, among the speech holders, straight-sung, you shine, augment the protectresses, the life in the sacrifice
