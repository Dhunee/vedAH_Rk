## English translation:

“Sutambhara, is the ministrant priest of the instrumental tutor of the sacrifice, the causer of the upward ascent of all holy rites; the cow offers juicy (milk); the milk is distributed; announcing this in order (Avastāra) studies (the holy texts) without repose.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ministrant priest: sutambharo yajamānasya satpatiḥ: satpatiḥ = **hotā**;

Sutambhara = name of a ṛṣi, etymologically, the bearer or offerer of the oblation; hence, possibly a metaphorical person nation and in the context, merely describes the effusion of the **Soma**
