## English translation:

“In like manneer as the ancient (sages), those our predecessors, as all sages, and those of the present period (have obtained their wishes by his praise), so do you by praise extract (my desires) from him who is the oldest and best (of the gods), who is seated on the sacred grass, who is cognizant of heaven, coming to our presence, vigorous, swift, victorious, for by such praises you exalt him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 7.12; by such praises you exalt him: Or, anu yāsu vardhase may be applied to **Indra**, you prosper, Indra, by such praises
