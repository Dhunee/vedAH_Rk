## English translation:

“The showerer (of rain), the shedder of dew, the radiant and quick-going (car) has entered the region of the paternal east; the many-tinted and pervading (luminary) proceeds to both extremities of the firmament, (and so) preserves (the world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many-tinted and pervading luminary: pṛṣṇir **aśmā** vicakrame rajaspatyantau: **aśma** = **vyāpaka** or **sarvatra** **vyāpta**, pervading; also, it means, a stone, an allusion to a **pāṣāṇa**, or stone, which in some ceremonies is plural ced in the **āhavanīya** fire; aśma may also imply a simile, the term of comparison being dropped, **luptopamā** vā aśmā **sādṛśaḥ**
