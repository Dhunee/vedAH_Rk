## English translation:

“(Behold), men, this indescribable form from which the rivers (spring), and where the waters dwell; when (form, the firmament), the two, (day and night), associated and equally allied, as well as other (seasons), born (of it, as of a parent), here and there sustain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

(Behold): may be rendered also, as men, look at the form which is to be seen; here and there sustain: apparently the firmament is supported or maintained in its plural ce by the various changes of times and seasons which it may be considered to genitive rate
