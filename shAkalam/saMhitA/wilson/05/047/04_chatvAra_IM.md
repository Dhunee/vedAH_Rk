## English translation:

“The four (chief priests) sustain him (with oblation and praises), seeking their own welfare; the ten (regions of space) invigorate him, their embryo, to travel (his daily course); his three elementary rays swiftly traverse the boundaries of the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The four chief priests: the text has only catvāraḥ, four; ṛtvijaḥ are implied; his three elementary rays: tridhātavo **gāvaḥ**, supposed to be the causes of cold, heat and rain. Or, simply three ore elements: copper, silver, gold
