## English translation:

“These dawns diffuse the consciousness that is apprehended by pious men, and (overspread) the whole world with uniform, investing (light); the devout man disregards the dawns which have turned back, and (those which) are to come, and improves (his understanding) by those which have proceeded.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The dawns which have...: āpo apācīr **aparā** apejate: **apaciḥ** = pratinivṛttamukhiḥ;

Aparā = agaminir uṣasaḥ;

Apejate = apācalayati, he causes to go away; he sends away future dawns with averted faces; improves his understanding: pra pūrvābhistirate = pratirate: vardhayati sva maniṣam or svayam vardhate
