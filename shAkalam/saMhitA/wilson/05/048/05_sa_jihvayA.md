## English translation:

“Blazing with his (fiery) tongue in the four quarters (of the horizon) he proceeds (to the sacrifice), wearing beautiful (lustre), the disperser of darkness, extirpating foes; we know him not (as endowed) with manhood, whereby this adorable **Savitā** bestows desirable (wealth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

We know him not as endowed: na tasya vidma puruṣatvata vayam: tasya = tam, we do not know him; joined with or possessed of yuktam, manliness, puruṣatvena, or the property of fulfilling desires, kāmānām pūrakatvena
