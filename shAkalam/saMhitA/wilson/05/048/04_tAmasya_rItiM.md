## English translation:

“(I behold) the practice of that (**Agni**) as of a deputy (or axe); I celebrate the host (of rays) of that (resplendent) form, (designed) for the enjoyment (of mankind); if he be with (the worshipper), he bestows upon the man who invokes him at a sacrifice such opulence as a mansion abounding with food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As of a depty: tām **asya** rītim paraśor iva: the verb is supplied, paśyāmi;

**Paraśu** = **pratinidhi**, a deputy, a substitute; just a depyt fulfils the will of his master, so the functions of Agni make him the deputy or representative of the **yajamāna**; or paraśu may imply an axe, which accomplishes the object of the wood-cutter, as Agni does that of the sacrificer
