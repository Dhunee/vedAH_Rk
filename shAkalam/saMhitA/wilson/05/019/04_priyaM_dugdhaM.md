## English translation:

“May (**Agni**) with his two relatives, (heaven and earth), hear this faultless (praise), acceptable as milk; he who, like the mixed oblation, is filled with food, and unsubsdued, is ever the subduer of his foes.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He who, like the mixed oblations, is filled with food: gharmo na vājajaṭharaḥ, he in whose belly is food like the **gharmaḥ**; the ordinary sense is warm, hot and day; it is further identified with the ceremony called **pravargya**: pravargya iva gharmo yathā havyenājyenapayasā siktā, like the pravargya the **gharma**, sprinkled with the oblation butter and milk;

Gharma = a vessel, a pitcher
