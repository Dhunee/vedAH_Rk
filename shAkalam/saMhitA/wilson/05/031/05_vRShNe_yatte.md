## English translation:

“When the **Maruts**, the showerers (of benefits), glorify you, **Indra**, the showerer (of desires), with praises, and the exulting stones delight (to bruise the **Soma**), then, without horses, without chariots, they, the purifying (Maruts), dispatched by Indra, have overcome the **Dasyus**.”
