## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, (abiding on the further bank), have rendered the fertilizing waters agreeable to **Yadu** and Turvaśu; you two, (Indra and **Kutsa**), have assailed the fierce (**Śuṣṇa**), and (having slain him), you have conveyed Kutsa (to his dwelling), and **Uśanās** and the gods have therefore honoured you both.”
