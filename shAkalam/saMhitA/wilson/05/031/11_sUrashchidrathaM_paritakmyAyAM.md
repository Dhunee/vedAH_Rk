## English translation:

“He, (**Indra**), has formerly arrested in battle the rapid chariot of the sun; **Etaśa** has born away the wheel, and (with it Indra) demolishes (his foes); may he, giving us precedence, be propitiated by our rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Etaśa has borne away the wheel: bharaccakram **etaśaḥ**: etaśaḥ is put for etasaya, he, Indra, has taken the wheel for Etaśa
