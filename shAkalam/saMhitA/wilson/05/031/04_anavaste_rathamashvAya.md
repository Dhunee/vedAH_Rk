## English translation:

“The **Ṛbhus** have fabricated your car, **Indra**, the invoked of many, adapted to its horses; **Tvaṣṭā** (had made) your radiant thunderbolt; the venerable (**Aṅgirasas**), praising Indra with hymns, have given him vigour for the destruction of Ahi.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Ṛbhus: **anavaḥ** is the text, explained **manuṣyaḥ** and applied to **ṛbhavaḥ**; the venerable aṅgirasas: brāhmaṇāḥ, **brāhmaṇas** is the text, explained as **aṅgirasaḥ**
