## English translation:

“May your steeds bring you both, **Indra** and **Kutsa** riding in one chariot, to the worshipper; you have expelled him (**Śuṣṇa**) from the waters, from his proper abode; you have driven the glooms (of ignorance) from the heart of the affluent (adorer).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To the worshipper: karṇe vahanta: **karṇa** = stotā, praiser, stotrāṇi **karoti**, or **yajamāna**, the instrumental tutor or maker of the rite
