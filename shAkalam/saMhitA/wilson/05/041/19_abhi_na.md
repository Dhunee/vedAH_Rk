## English translation:

“May Iḷā, the mother of the herd, and **Urvaśī** with the rivers, be favourable to us; may the bright-shining Urvaśī (come), commanding our devotion, and investing the worshipper with light.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Iḷā and Urvaśī: iḷā = the earth, or the daughter of **Manu**, in the form of a cow, the mother of the herd, yūthasya **mātā**; or, the latter may be applied to the company of the **Maruts**, when Iḷā may be **madhyamikā** vāk, middle, articulate or human speech; or, the latter sense may be applied to Urvaśī; investing the worshipper with light: abhyūrṇarvānā prabhṛthasyā yoḥ: the latter term should be read ayum, in the accusative ative, man or the **yajamāna**;

Prabhṛta = light, **tejas**, or water, udakam (**Nirukta** 2.49) and being in the genitive tive, requires dānena, by the gift of; or, the ellipse may be filled up by yajñam, when the sentence will be: covering or protecting the sacrifice of the man making the offering
