## English translation:

“I glorify with unqualified praise the embryo of the earth-fertilizing rain, the grandson of the waters, **Agni**, who is threefold, who rages (upon me) not, when travelling with (his) withering rays, but, bright-haired consumes the forests.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Earth-fertilizing rain: vṛṣṇo bhūmyasya garbham: bhūmya = suited to the earth or the firmament, bhūmir antarkṣam; in the latter case, the embryo of the firmamental rain will mean Agni as the lightning; with his withering rays: gṛṇīte agni etarī na śūṣaiḥ = mayi gantari na krudhyati sukhakarai **raśmibhiḥ**, who is not angry upon me when going with his agreeable rays; but, **śuṣa** = drying up
