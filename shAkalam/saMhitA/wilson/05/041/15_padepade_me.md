## English translation:

“My praise has been continually proffered as a protectress, powerful with (the means of) preservation; may the maternal and venerable earth accept our (praises), and, (plural ased) with her pious (worshippers) be (to us) straight-handed, and the giver of good.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As a protectress: **varūtrī** = **asmad** upadravavarayitrī, what or who keeps off oppression upon us
