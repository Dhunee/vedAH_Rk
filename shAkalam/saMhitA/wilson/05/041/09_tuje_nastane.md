## English translation:

“May the **Parvatas** be (bountiful) to us in liberal donations; may they be favourable (to us) who are the establishers (of the world) like heroes; may the adored and adorable (deity), who is accessible (to all), who is friendly to man, ever grant us increase, being propitiated by our praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Parvatas: the clouds; in liberal donations: tuje nastane: tane = vistṛte, expanded;

Tuje = dāne, gift; or, tuje = son;

Tane = grandson; accessible to all: āptyo **yajataḥ**: āptyo = āptavyaḥ sarvaiḥ, to be obtained by all;

Yajataḥ = yajanīya, to be worshipped, that is, **Āditya**; propitiated by our praise: naḥ śaṃsam abhiṣṭau = our praise in seeking or approaching
