## English translation:

“**Maruts**, do you bring wealth comprising horses; to acquire and preserve riches the wise man offers you praise; may the ministrant priest, (**Atri**), of the son of Uśij (**Kakṣīvat**), be made happy by those swift-going (horses) which are the swift-going (horses), Maruts, of you who are rapid in motion.”
