## English translation:

“May the lord of vigour, (**Vāyu**), hear our prayers, he who traverses the firmament, the circumambient; may the waters hear, bright as cities, flowing round the towering mountains.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bright as cities: **puro** na **śubhrāḥ** = purāṇi iva **dipta**, shining like cities
