## English translation:

“Mighty **Maruts**, of goodly aspect, quickly hear (the praises) that we who repair to you repeat, offering acceptable (oblations); (the Maruts) coming hither, well disposed, come down to us, (destroying) with their weapons the mortals opposed to them, (overcome) by agitation.”
