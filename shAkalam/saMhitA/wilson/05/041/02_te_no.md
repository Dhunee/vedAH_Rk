## English translation:

“May those divinities, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, **Aryaman**, Āyu, **Indra**, **Ṛbhukṣin**, the **Maruts** who accept pious praise, be plural ased by our adorations, partaking of the gratification afforded to **Rudra**, the showerer (of benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Divinities who accept pious praise: divinities are of two orders, those who share praises, stotrabhājaḥ, and those who share oblations havirbhājaḥ, the first is here alluded to; Rudra the showerer: the last clause may allude to the Maruts as the sons of Rudra
