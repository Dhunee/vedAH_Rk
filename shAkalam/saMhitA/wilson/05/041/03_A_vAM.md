## English translation:

“I invoke you, **Aśvins**, the restrainers (of desire), for the acceleration ofyour chariot with the swiftness of the wind; (priests) offer praise and oblations to the celestial destroyer of life, to the accmplisher of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Celestial destroyer of life: divo asurāya = dyotamānāya prāṇāpahartre, that is, to **Rudra**;

Yajyave = yāgasādhakāya;

**Asura** = prāṇadātā, the giver, of life, when it will imply **Sūrya** or **Vāyu**
