## English translation:

“Hero, lord of horses, may the **Soma**, ascend to your destructive jaw, as if to the summit of a mountain; may we all, royal **Indra**, who are invoked of many, give plural asure to you with our hymns, as to horses with fodder.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ascend to your destructive jaw: **hanu** śipre āruhat: the two nouns have the same sense; hence, one is an epithet of the other;

Hanu = means of destroying, or destructive **hanana** sādhanam
