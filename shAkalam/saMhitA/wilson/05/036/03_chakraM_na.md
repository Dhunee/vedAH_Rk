## English translation:

“Wielder of the thunderbolt, the invoked of many, my mind trembles through dread of poverty like a whirling wheel; **Maghavan**, ever prosperous, may your worshipper, **Puruvasu**, praise you promptly and abundantly, seated in your chariot.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Through dread of poverty: amater id: amati = dāridyam, poverty, or astotā, one who does not praise or worship
