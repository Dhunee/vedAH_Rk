title = "Rig Veda 5.10.2"

## English translation:

“Marvellous **Agni**, (gratified) by our acts, (produce) in us greatness of vigour; in you abides the strength destroying evil spirits; you who are to be worshipped like **Mitra**, are the doer (of great deeds).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The text has only krāṇā for kurvāṇā; the acts alluded to are such as driving away the **rākṣasas** or other disturbers of religious rites
