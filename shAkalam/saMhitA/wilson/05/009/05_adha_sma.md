## English translation:

“Of whom smoke-emitting, the flames intensely collect; then, when diffused in the three regions, **Agni** inflates himself in the firmament, like the blower of a bellows, and sharpens (his flames), as (the fire blazes from the blast) of the blower.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When diffused in the three regions: yadīm aha trito **divi** upadhamāti = triṣu sthāṇesu **vyāptaḥ**, spread in the three regions; or, triāi sthānāni atītya, having gone beyond the three regions; ātmānam upa vardhayati, he blows up or enlarges himself; as the fire blazes from the blast of the blower: the text has śiśīte dhmātari, he sharpens as in a blower; i.e., like the fire, which in the proximity of one blowing with a bellows, blazes up, so Agni sharpens his flames,or of himself adds to their intensity
