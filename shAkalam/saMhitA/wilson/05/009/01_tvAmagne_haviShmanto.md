## English translation:

“Mortals bearing oblations glorify you, **Agni**, the divine; I praise you, **Jātavedas**, for that you convey successively oblations (to the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Jātavedas: the name seems to imply, he whom all know to be identical with all that exists; or, Vedasmean wealth, when it will signify, he from whom all wealth is genitive rated
