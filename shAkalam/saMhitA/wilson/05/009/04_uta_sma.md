## English translation:

“You are laid hold of with difficulty like the young of tortuously-twining (snakes); you who are the consumer of many forests, as an animal is of fodder.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the young of tortuously twining snakes: putro na hvāryāṇām, like the son of the crooked-going, like a young snake, **bāla** **sarpaḥ**; or it may mean the colt of rearing and plural nging horses, of those not broken in a aśiksi.ta bālaśvaḥ
