## English translation:

“I, **Arya**, **Agni**, praise **Śatri**, the son of **Agniveśa**, the bestower of thousands, a type for comparison; may the collected waters yield him abundance; may wealth and strength, and glory be upon him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agni: **Indra** is referred as identical with Agni; Agniveśa is a ṛṣi, a son of **Brahmā**
