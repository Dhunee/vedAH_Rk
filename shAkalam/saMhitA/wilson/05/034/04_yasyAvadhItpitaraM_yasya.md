## English translation:

“**Śakra** does not turn away from him whose father, whose mother, whose brother he has slain, but is willing to accept his offerings; the regulator (of acts), the bestower of riches, does not turn away from iniquity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Does not turn away: na ata īṣate = he does not fear, or does not go up or from hence, na bibheti na gacchati vā; whose brother he has slain: avadhīt has the nominative native śakra; in the second line kilviṣād īṣate, he, **Indra**, does not go from sin, sin is a reference to the sinner, that is, from one who is a patricide or the like, pitrādi **vadha** yuktāt, that is, he does not turn away from who has committed these crimes; the reason is: veti idvasya prayata, for verily he desires his offerings, prayatāni dadāni
