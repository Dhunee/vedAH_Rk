## English translation:

“When **Indra**, the possessor of opulence, discriminates between two men, both wealthy, and exerting themselves (against each other) for the sake of valuable cattle, he takes one of them as his associate, causing (his adversaries) to tremble, and the agitator (of the clouds), together with the **Maruts**, bestows upon him herds of cattle.”
