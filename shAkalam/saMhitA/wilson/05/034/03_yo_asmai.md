## English translation:

“He who pours out the libation to that **Indra**, by day or by night, undoubtely becomes illustrious; **Śakra** disregards tthe man who is proud of his descendants and vain of his person n, and who, though wealthy, is the friend of the base.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Proud of his descendants and vain of his person n: tatanuṣṭim tanūśubhram = he who desires, (vaṣṭi) an extended (**tata**) race (santatim) and he whose person n (**tanu**) is decorated (**śubhra**) with ornaments, and in both implying svapoṣakam ayajvānam, a self-cherisher not offering sacrifice
