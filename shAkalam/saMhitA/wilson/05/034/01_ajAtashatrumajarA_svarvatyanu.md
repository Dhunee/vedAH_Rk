“The undecaying, heaven-conferring, unlimited (sacrificial) food, goes to the tamer (of enemies), whose adversarie are unborn; therefore (priests) pour out (the libation), dress (the cakes and butter), diligently discharge (your offices) to him who is the accepter of prayer, who si glorified by many.”
