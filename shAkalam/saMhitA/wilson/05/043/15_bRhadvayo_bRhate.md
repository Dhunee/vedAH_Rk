## English translation:

“Married pairs, worn by devout rites; jointly offer abundant sacrificial food, **Agni**, to you who are mighty; may each individual divinity be successfully invoked by me; let them not take us into unfavourable thought.”

Jointly offer: jāyāpati agnim adadhīyātām, let husband and wife worship or keep up Agni
