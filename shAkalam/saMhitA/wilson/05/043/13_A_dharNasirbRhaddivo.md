## English translation:

“May the sustainer of all, (**Agni**), the greatly radiant, the delighter, come, with all his protecting (faculties), when invoked; he who is clothed with flames and with plural nts; who is irresistible; who has horns of three colours, the showerer (of benefits), the accepter of oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Horns of three colours: tridhātu **śṛṅgaḥ**, his flames of three colours, red, white and black (or smoke). Or, tridhātu may simply connote protrusions of three elemental ores
