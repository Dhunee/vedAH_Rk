## English translation:

“May this adoring, earnest, and gratifying praise go like a messenger to summon the **Aśvins** hither; come, Aśvins, givers of happiness, riding in one chariot, come down to the deposited (**Soma**), as the bolt (is essential) to the axle of the wagon.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As the cart cannot move if the axle of the wheel is not fastened by the pin or bolt, so the offering of the Soma is without efficacy unless the Aśvins be present
