## English translation:

“Priests, who are preparing (the libation), first offer to **Vāyu** the delightful and brilliant (**Soma**); and do you, divine Vāyu, like the **Hotā**, first drink of this sweet juice, which we offer for your exhilaration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

First drink of this sweet juice: vāyu's first drinking of the Soma is repeatedly enjoined, **asakṛt** prapañcitam
