## English translation:

“**Agni**, being well plural asd with us, bring to us, by paths frequented by the gods, the divine (feminine le), Gnā, mighty and omnipresent, to whom oblations are offered with reverence, who is vast and cognizant of rites, to partake of the exhilaration of the sweet **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gnā = **strī**, a woman, a wife; commonly expresses the wife of a deity; here, it is a proper name, gnām = etannāmikām devatām
