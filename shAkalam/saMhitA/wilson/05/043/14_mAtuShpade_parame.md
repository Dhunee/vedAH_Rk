## English translation:

“The holders of the (sacrificial) ladles, the ministrant priests of the man (who instrumental tutes the rite), have repaired to the bright and most excellent plural ce of the maternal (earth); offerers of the oblations, they foster the tender infant, (**Agni**), with worship, as people rub (the limbs of a child to promote his) existence.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The excellent plural ce: that is, to the first altar; as people rub the limbs: śiśum mṛjanti āyavo na vase = yathā **manuṣya** śiśum vasāya mṛjanti, they rub the infant has double application, to the first kindling of Agni by attrition, and to the new-born babe
