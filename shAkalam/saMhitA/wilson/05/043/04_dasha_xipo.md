## English translation:

“The ten express of the juice, (the fingers), and the two arms of the priests, which are the dexterous immolators of the **Soma**, take hold of the stone; the exulting, skilful-fingered (priest) milks the mountain-born juice of the sweet Soma, and that Soma (yields its) pure juice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The text has only śukram **aṃśuḥ** = sa ca **aṃsu**'h śukram nirmalam rasam dugdhe, and that Soma has milked the pure juice; or **aṃśu** may be an epithet of **adhvaryu**, the extensively present priest, aṃśur vyāpto **adhvaryuḥ**
