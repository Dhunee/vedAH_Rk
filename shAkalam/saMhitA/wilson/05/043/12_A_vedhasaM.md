## English translation:

“(Priests) plural ce the mighty **Bṛhaspati**, the creator whose back is dark blue, in the chamber (of sacrifice); let us worship him who is seated in the interior of the mansion, everywhere shining, golden-hued, resplendent.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whose back is dark blue: that is, who is enveloped in smoke, from this and other attributes specified and his presence in the sacrificial chamber, the inference is that Bṛhaspati is **Agni**, ityādi liṅgair apyagnir eva **Bṛhaspatiḥ**
