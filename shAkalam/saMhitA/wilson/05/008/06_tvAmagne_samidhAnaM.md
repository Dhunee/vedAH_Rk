## English translation:

“**Agni**, young (of the deities), the gods have made you, when kindled, their messenger, the bearer of oblations; you, who are rapid in movement, and of whom butter is the source, they have made, when invoked, the brilliant eye (of the universe), instrumental gated by the understanding.”
