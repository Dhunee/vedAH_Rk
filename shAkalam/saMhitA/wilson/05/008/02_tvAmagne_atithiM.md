## English translation:

“Men have established you, (**Agni**), their ancient guest, as the lord of the house; (you), the blazing-haired, the vast bannered, the multiform, the dispenser of wealth, the bestower of happiness, the kind protector, the destruction of decaying (trees).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Jaradviṣam = liṭ, that which is poison to the old; it is explained as jaratām vṛkṣāṇām vyāpakam, the pervader or consumer of old trees; or, it may mean jirṇodakam, that by which water is dried up
