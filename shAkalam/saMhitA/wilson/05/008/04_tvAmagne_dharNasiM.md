## English translation:

“We approach you, all-sustaining **Agni**, adoring you in many ways with hymns and with prostrations; do you, **Aṅgiras**, when kindled, be propitious to us; may the divine (Agni be plural ased) by the (sacrificial) food (offered by the) worshippers, and by the bright flames (of his sacrifice).”
