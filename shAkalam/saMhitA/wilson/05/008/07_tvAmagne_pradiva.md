## English translation:

“The ancient seekers after happiness hav ekindled you, **Agni**, when invoked, (and fed you) with abundant fuel; and you (thereby) increasing, and supplied with shrubs, are dominat over all terrestrial viands.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abhi jayāṃsi **pārthiva** vi tiṣṭhase: jayāṃsi = annāni, food, eatbles;

Pārthiva = **vṛkṣaḥ**, trees, an epither of jayāṃsi, earthly eatbles, as the cakes and butter presented in sacrifices with fire
