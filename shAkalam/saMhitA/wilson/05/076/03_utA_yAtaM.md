## English translation:

“Whether you come at the (milking time) of the cattle, at the dawn of day, at noon, when the sun is high, or by day or by night, (come) with felicitious protection; the drinking of the **Soma** has not now extended beyond the **Aśvins**. (whether you come: the day is divisible into two, three, five or fifteen parts; here the five-fold distinction is alluded to: uditā sūryasya = the afternoon, atyanta **pravṛddha** **samayaḥ** **aparāhṇa** ityarthaḥ; the drinking of the soma...Aśvins: nedānīm pītir aśvinā tatāna: legend-- the other gods refused to admit the participation of the Aśvins in the Soma libation at these hours, but on the present occasion they are not passed over; idānim api itaradevānām pānam na tanotyaśvinau vihāya, but now the drinking of the other gods does not extend, having omitted the two Aśvins\]”
