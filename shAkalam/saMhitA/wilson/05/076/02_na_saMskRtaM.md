## English translation:

“Harm not, **Aśvins**, the perfected (rite), but coming now most quickly, be glorified on this occasion; be present at the opening of the ay, with proection against destitution, and be prompt to bestow happiness upon the donor (of the offering).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With protection against destitution: **avasa** agamiṣṭhā pratyavartim: **varti** = jīvānām, living or livelihood;

Avarti = the contrary, the want of it
