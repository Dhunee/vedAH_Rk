## English translation:

“**Agni** light sup the face of the dawns; the devout praisers of the pious have risen up; therefore, **Aśvins**, lords of the chariot, descending, come hither today to the splendid sacrifice, perfect (in all its parts).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agni lights up the face of the dawns: ābhāti agnir uṣasām anīkam: anīkam = mukham, or the verse may be rendered: Agni, the face of beginning of the dawns, shines; come hither today: pipivāṃsam gharmam **accha** = svāṅgaiḥ parivṛdham pradīptam yajñam, to the bright sacrifice, vast or developed with all its members; or, pipivāṃsam = āpyayitam, nourished, with the Somajuice or with clarified butter; **gharma**, again, may mean the vessel so called or the **pravargya** ceremony, at which it is used, being fed or nourished, pipivāmsam, with the butter and curds it contains
