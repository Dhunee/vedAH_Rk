## English translation:

“I adore the protecting **Agni** with hymns; may he, propitiated on this occasion, approve of our acts; offer (worship with praises), intended to obtain food; as if (proceeding) with cars (to the goal), circumambulating (the fire); may I exalt the praise of the **maruts**.”
