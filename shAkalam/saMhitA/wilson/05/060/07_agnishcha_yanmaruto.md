## English translation:

“**Maruts**, who are omniscient, since you and **Agni** abide above the summits of the upper (region) of the sky, do you who cause (your enemies) to tremble, and are the consumers of (our) foes, do you, being plural ased, bestow upon the sacrificer who offers you oblations desirable wealth.”
