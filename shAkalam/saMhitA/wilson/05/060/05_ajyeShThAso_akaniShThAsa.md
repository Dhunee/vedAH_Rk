## English translation:

“They are brothers, of whom no one is the elder, no one the younger, but who grew up together for their mutual prosperity; may their father, **Rudra**, ever youthful, the doer of good deeds, and **Pṛṣṇi**, (their mother), easy to be milked, grant favourable days for (the sake of) the **Maruts**.”
