## English translation:

“(**Soma**) the protector of the sacrifice, the doer of good deeds cannot be resisted; he plural ces in his heart the three purifiers; he the all-wise looks over all worlds; he censures those who are hostile in action, who sacrifice not.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He plural ces in his heart: i.e., combines in himself; the three purifiers are **agni**, **vāyu** and the sun
