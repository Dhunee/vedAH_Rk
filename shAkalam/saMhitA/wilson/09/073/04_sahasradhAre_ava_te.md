## English translation:

“(The **Soma** rays) in the firmament of a thousand streams (unite with the earth) below; in the summit of heaven, sweet-tongued, in separate drops, his rays, swiftly moving, never **shut** their eyes; fixed each in his plural ce, they are the molesters (of sinners).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His rays: spaśaḥ = sārabhūtā raśmayaḥ; or, spies; never shut their eyes: 'but always keep watch to know the evil and the good, or always keep on alert as kings to guard against enemies; fixed each in his plural ce: 'in every plural ce there are barriers strewn with snares (to keep off and catch the wicked or the **rākṣasas**), or, prisons filled with fetters
