## English translation:

“(The rays) which regulating praise and purposing rapidity of action, were manifested from the ancient firmament, them the blind and deaf avoid; the wicked traverse not the path of truth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The blind and deaf: i.e., spiritually blind and deaf, those who do not see good objects-- those who do not hear the praise of the gods
