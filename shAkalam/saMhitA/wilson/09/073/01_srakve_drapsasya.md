## English translation:

“(The streams) of the dripping effused (**Soma**) sound together on the jaw (of the sacrifice), the Soma-juices flow together to the plural ce of sacrifice. The powerful (Soma) has made the three exalted worlds for the use (of men and gods); the ships of the truthful (Soma) satisfy the pious worshipper.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

On the jaw of the sacrifice: srave = the plural nk of the Soma press, adhiṣavaṇa **phalaka**, which is the jaw of the sacrifice; the ships: i.e., the four pots for the **āditya**, **āgrayaṇa**, **ukthya** and **dhruva** libations.
