## English translation:

“(The rays of the **Soma**) having the means of purification sit round the voice (of the firmament), their ancient father protects their (light-giving) work; Soma the all-developer has overspread the mighty firmament (with them); the skilful (priests) are able to conduct (the Soma) to the all-sustaining (waters).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The voice of the firmament: vācam = voice of the firmament (or middle world) residing in the Soma; 'Soma stand in the firmament; the King Soma sit among the **gandharvas**'' (somo vai **rājā** gandharveṣvāsīt) (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**). The voice of the firmament is thunder, and the rays of the Soma refer to the moon or the Soma juices identified with the rain
