## English translation:

“The sage (**Soma**) is born with developed mind; having his plural ce in the womb of the water, he is deposited (by the gods) by rule from far off; even when young these two were distinct; the birth (of one half) was plural ced in secret, the (other) half was visible.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This may refer to the fact that rain is caused by the sun, with which Soma is identified; the last part of the verse may refer to the sun, which appears in the daytime, and the moon, which appears at night
