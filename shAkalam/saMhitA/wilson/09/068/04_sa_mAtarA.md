## English translation:

“The wise (**Soma**) wandering through the two worlds, sending forth the waters, flattens his station with food; the Soma-juice collected by the priests is mixed with the barley; it is united by the fingers; it protects the head.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His station: i.e., the **uttara** **vedī**, the northern altar; it protects the head: **śiraḥ** = śīrṇam bhūtajātam (the withered world?)
