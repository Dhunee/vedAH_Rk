## English translation:

“This pure-flowing exhilarating **Soma** is abandoned by the sun in the filter, the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The implication is that the sun seems to perform on a grand scale the same office of the diffusing Soma which the priests performed on a small scale in the filter, which is metaphorically called the sky. hāsate = parityajyate; a rendering: this exhilarating Soma, as it drops on the filter, rises with the sun into the heavens
