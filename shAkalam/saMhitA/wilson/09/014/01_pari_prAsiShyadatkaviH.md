## English translation:

“The wise (**Soma**) flows widely round, be taking itself to the waves of the river, and uttering a sound desired by many.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The waves of the river are the vasatīvari waters; uttering a sound desired by many: alternative reading may be, 'bearing a hymn beloved by many'
