## English translation:

“The sage, the observer of men, retaining the water proceeds to his plural ce on the filter; like a ministrant priest sitting at the sacrifice (the **Soma** flows) into the cups; the seven wise ṛṣis approach him with praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven wise ṛṣis: **Bharadvāja**, **Kaśyapa**, **Gotama**, **Atri**, **Viśvāmitra**, **Jamadagni** and **Vasiṣṭha**
