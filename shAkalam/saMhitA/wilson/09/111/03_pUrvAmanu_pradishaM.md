## English translation:

“The intelligent **Soma** proceeds to the eastern quarter; (your) beautiful chariot, (your) celestial beautiful chariot meets the sun's rays; the manly praises advance to **Indra** and stimulate him to victory; (his) thunderbolt too (advances to him); so that you are invincible, invincible in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You are invincible: you two, i.e., Soma and Indra; or, better, so that you two, you and **Vajra**
