## English translation:

“With this bright green-tinted stream **Soma** being filtered overcomes all enemies with the (juices) yoked to it, as the sun (overcomes the darkness) with the (rays) yoked to it; the stream of the effused (Soma) shines, the filtered green-tinted (Soma) is resplendent, which pervade all constellations, with the ṛkvans, with the seven-mouthed ṛkvans.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With the rays yoked to it: svayugvabhiḥ refers to **suraḥ**; the repetition adds dignity; with the ṛkvans, with the seven-mouthed ṛkvans: rikvabhiḥ = stutimadbhiḥ; second ṛkvans = tejobhiḥ; thus, 'with encomiastic splendours' is the rendering; the seven-mouths are for taking up the Soma juice
