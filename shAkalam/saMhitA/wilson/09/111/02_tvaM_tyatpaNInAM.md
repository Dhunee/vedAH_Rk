## English translation:

“You did discover the wealth of the **Paṇis**, and are washed in your own house at the sacrifice by the mothers, the supporters of the sacrifice; as the hymn (is heard) from afar, so it (is heard by all, the hymn) in which the supporters (of the rite) rejoice; the shining (**Soma**) with its brilliant (waters), the supporters of the three (worlds), gives food, gives food (to the worshippers).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the mothers: the vasatīvarī waters
