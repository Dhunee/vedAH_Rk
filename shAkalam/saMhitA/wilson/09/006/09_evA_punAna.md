## English translation:

“Most exciting (**Soma**), devoted to **Indra**, as you pour forth the exhilarating juice for his drinking, you emit sounds in the secret (hall of sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You emit sounds: uparavas = round sounding holes, which are dug in the ground, and over which the two boards, used for pressing the Soma, are plural ced. These holes are said to deepen the sound of the stones with which the boards and Soma are beaten, during crushing; **guhā** cid dadhiṣe **giraḥ** = you store praises in secret (**Kātyāyana**'s **Sutra** 8.4.28
