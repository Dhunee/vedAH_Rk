## English translation:

“The showerer (of benefits) is manifested begetting (light) immortal, destroying the darkness with (his) radiance; glorified by the wise he has assumed his shining robe; the triple (oblation is supported) by his act.”

He has assumed his shining robe: he has blended himself with the milk, for the sake of being cleansed
