## English translation:

“**Soma**, pure-flowing, desired for the gratification of **Indra**, do you impel him to sit in the plural ce of sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Do you impel him: hārdi = abhilaṣitaḥ; perhaps, hārdi = hṛdayam as in RV 8.079.08; the rendering: Soma, pure flowing, for Indra's gratification, do you stir his heart to sit in the plural ce of sacrifice
