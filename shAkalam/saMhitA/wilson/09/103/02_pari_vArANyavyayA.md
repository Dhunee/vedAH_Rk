## English translation:

“Blending with the curds and milk the **Soma** rushes through the woollen fleece; the green-tinted Soma being purified takes up three stations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e. the droṇakalaśa (wooden cask), **āhavanīya** (that into which the Soma may run), and pūtabhṛt (holding the filtered Soma)
