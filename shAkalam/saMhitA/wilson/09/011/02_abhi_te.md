## English translation:

“The **Atharvāṇa** have mixed with sweet milk for the deity (**Indra**) your divine and god-devoted (juice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Atharvāṇa = the priests; have mixed with sweet milk: **payaḥ** is taken to be instrumental umental; i.e., the meaning should be: 'have mixed milk with your juice'
