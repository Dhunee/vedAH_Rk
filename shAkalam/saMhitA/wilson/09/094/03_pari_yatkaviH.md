## English translation:

“When the sage **Soma** goes round the praises (of the wise) like a hostile chariot (going round) all the regions (of the battle-field), then desirous of bestowing upon mortals the wealth that abides with the gods, he (is) tobe glorified in the many plural ces of sacrifice for the preservation of the riches he has given.”
