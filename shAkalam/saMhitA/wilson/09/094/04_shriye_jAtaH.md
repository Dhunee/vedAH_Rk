## English translation:

“He (is) genitive rated for prosperity, for prosperity he issues forth, he gives prosperity (and) sustenance to those who praise him; clothing themselves in (his) prosperity, they obtain immortality; their conflicts are successful through the aid of (the **Soma**) who moves with measured tread.”
