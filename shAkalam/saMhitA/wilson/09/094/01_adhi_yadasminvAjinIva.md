## English translation:

“When the fingers vie with each other in this (**Soma**), as the trappings on a horse or the rays in the sun, clothed in the waters he flows desiring his worshippers like (a cowherd going to) a plural asant cow-stall for the nourishment of his cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vie with each: spardhanti = aham purastācchodhayām yaham **puraḥ** śodhayāmītyahamahamikayopatiṣṭhanti
