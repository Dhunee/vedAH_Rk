## English translation:

“Openingout the abode of the ambrosia on both sides (he passes between); for him, the omniscient, the worlds expand. Gratifying laudations eager for the sacrifice, call upon **Indu**, like kine (lowing) towards their stall.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The abode of the ambrosia: i.e., the firmament, the home of the waters; call upon Indu like kine lowing: svasare = of the laudations on the day of sacrifice; of the kine towards their stall
