## English translation:

“Many wise men utter praise together, when they have milked the **Soma** into **Indra**'s belly, when fair-armed men cleanse the delightful exhilarating juice with their ten united (fingers).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra's belly: i.e., the droṇakalaśa; with their ten united fingers: sanilabhiḥ = liṭ, having one nest (**nida**);

Sanīḷa = samānasthāna, samānanivāsa
