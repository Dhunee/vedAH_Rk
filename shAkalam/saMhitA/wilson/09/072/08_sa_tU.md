## English translation:

“Performer of good deeds, flow quickly round the terrestrial region, giving (riches) to the worshipper and the shaker (of the libation); do not deprive us of the wealth that enriches our dwellings; may we be invested with abundant wealth of diverse kinds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The shaker of the libation: ādhūnvate = making the ādhāvana (shaking) with the three filaments of the **Soma**, after the adābhya libation
