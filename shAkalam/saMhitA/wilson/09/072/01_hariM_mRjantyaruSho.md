## English translation:

“They cleanse the green-tinted (**Soma**); he is harnessed like a swift horse; the Soma is combined in the pitcher with the products of the kine. He utters a sound, (the worshippers) send forth praise; how many (boons) abundantly delightint the utterer of many praises (does Soma bestow).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abundantly delighting: paripriyaḥ = paritaḥ prīṇayitṛṇi
