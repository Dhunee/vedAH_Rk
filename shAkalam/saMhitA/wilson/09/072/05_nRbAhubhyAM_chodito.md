## English translation:

“Urged by the arms of men, poured forth in a stream the **Soma** flows for you, **Indra**, for strength; you accomplish the rites, you overcome enemies at the sacrifice; the green-tinted Soma rests upon the cups like a bird perching on a tree.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For strength: Or, for the sake of food;

Enemies: **matiḥ** = abhimānān śatrūn
