## English translation:

“The flows towards the pitchers, like a darught horse, lightly moving, the showerer; and knowing both races of gods-- those who come to (the sacrifice) from the other world and those who (come) from this world.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aśnoti is a predicate of yat; **somaḥ** as the subject of aśnoti: 'he acquires what is in the world above and what is in this world; 'he acquires from the next world what is there and from this world what is here'
