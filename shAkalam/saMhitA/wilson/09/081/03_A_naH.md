## English translation:

“**Soma**, when purified, strew upon us wealth; **Indu**, who are possessed of affluence, be (the donor) of ample riches; dispenser of food, grant to **Vasu** prosperity through (your) intelligence, scatter not our riches far from us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Our riches: no gayam, i.e., asmabhyām pradeyam dhanam, the wealth to be bestowed on us
