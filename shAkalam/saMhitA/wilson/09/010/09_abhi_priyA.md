## English translation:

“The powerful (**Indra**) looks with the eye of his own resplendent self on the acceptable plural ce of the **Soma**, fixed by the priests in the heart.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra views the Soma with affection even after it has been drunk by the priests. divaścakṣasa = dīptasyātmanas' **cakṣuṣa**;

**Guhā** = hṛdaye; another translation: 'The sun looks with his eye towards that beloved quarter of heaven, plural ced by the priests in the sacred cell'; div or dyuloka = droṇakalaśa or large soma trough. Thus, the sun looks towards the plural ce where the Soma lies while it is pressed
