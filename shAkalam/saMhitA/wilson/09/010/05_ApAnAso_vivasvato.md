## English translation:

“The beverages of **Vivasvat** and producing the glory of the dawn, the issuing juices spread their sound.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vivasvat = **Indra**; āpānasaḥ = āpānabhūtaḥ; spread their sound: aṇvam vitanvate = śabdam kurvanti; elsewhere, aṇva is explained as the small holes of the filter
