## English translation:

“Since your splendour abounds, you purified sage, **Soma**, are everywhere (associated) with the seasons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e. Soma whose attributes are the seasons such as spring, exists wherever day and night spread; because day and night are dependent on the Soma (i.e., the moon)
