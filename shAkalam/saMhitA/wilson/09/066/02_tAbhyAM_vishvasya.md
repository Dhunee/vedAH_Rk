## English translation:

“You, purified **Soma**, rule the universe by those two halves (of the **lunar month**) which stand facing you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Those two halves: **dhāmanī** = pūrvādipakṣau, the first and second fortnights of the lunar month, the sides or halves of the month resembling in their increase and decrease the sides of a creeper, whose leaves alternate; or, nāmāni aṃśusomātmake, the two names (**aṃśu** and Soma); 'on earth under the name aṃśu by granting the desires of all mankind (Soma rules) this world; in heaven by giving the gods your lunar digits you are the winner of their affections. The gods drink the digits of the (moon) Soma by means of their growth and diminution one by one (i.e., as the moon waxes and wanes); dhāmanī probably means the two abodes (or stations) of the Soma
