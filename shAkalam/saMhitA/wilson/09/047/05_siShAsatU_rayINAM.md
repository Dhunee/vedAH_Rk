## English translation:

“You desire to give wealth to those who conquer in combat as (men offer fodder) to horses in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You desire to give wealth: siṣāsatuḥ; another interpretation treats this term as 3rd dual, 'they two desire wealth'; bhareṣu jigyuṣāmasi = you are on the side of the successful in battle
