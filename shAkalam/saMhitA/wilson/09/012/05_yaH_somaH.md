## English translation:

“**Indu** has embraced that **Soma** which is collected in the sewers and has been passed through the filter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indu has embraced: Indu embraces the Soma which is a portion of himself-- the deity seems to be thus opposed to the mere Soma in its early forms
