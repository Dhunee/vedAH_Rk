## English translation:

“I invoke the two divine priests, the two deities who behold men-- the pure-flowing (**Soma**) is radiant and the showerer (of benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The pure-flowing Soma is radiant: perhaps, an identification of Soma with **Indra**, just as in the next verse, **Indu** (i.e. Soma) is identified with Indra.
