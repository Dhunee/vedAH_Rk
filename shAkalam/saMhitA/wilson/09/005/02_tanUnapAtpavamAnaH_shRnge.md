## English translation:

“The pure-flowing **Tanūnapāt**, rushes sharpening its splendour on the height and hastens through the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tanūnapāt = a name of **Soma**, abhyo amśavo jāyante **tataḥ** somo jāyate, from the waters are born beams, from these is born Soma; hastens through the sky: that is, to the droṇakalaśa, according to the text, 'he takes **āgrayaṇa** libation with two streams'
