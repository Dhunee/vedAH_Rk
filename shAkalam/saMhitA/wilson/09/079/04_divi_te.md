## English translation:

“Your best juice (dwells) in the navel of heaven, that which receives (the oblation); your (members) grow up thrown upon the summit of the earth; the stones devour you upon the cowhide; the wise (priests) milk you into the water with their **hands**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The stones devour you upon the cowhide: **Soma** was poured out upon a black antelope's skin; but,t he Soma was measured on a cowhide for the purpose of selling
