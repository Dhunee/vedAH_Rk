## English translation:

“The nymphs of the firmament seated in the midst flow towards the sagacious **Soma**; they cherish him the sprinkler of the hall of sacrifice; (the worshippers) solicit **Pavamāna** (the undecaying) for a boon.”

In the midst: in the middle of the sacrifice, i.e., in the cups
