## English translation:

“You are effused by the priests, **Soma**, for **Indra**; you the observer of men, stimulated, intelligent, are immersed in the water; many are the paths for you to follow, infinite are the spreading green-tinted streams alighting on the cups.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many are the paths for you to follow: or, 'there are ancient paths for you to go to Indra, and a thousand bay horses standing in the cups'\].
