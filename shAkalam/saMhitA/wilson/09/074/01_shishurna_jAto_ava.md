## English translation:

“Born in the water (the **Soma**) cries out like a child, when powerful and brilliant he wishes to enjoy heaven; he comes from the sky tomix with the water that nourish the kine; we ask him by our praises for an opulent dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Brilliant: or, swift as a horse; that nourish the kine: payovṛdhā, that feeds the milk of kine and the sap of herbs
