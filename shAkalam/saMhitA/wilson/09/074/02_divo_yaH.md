## English translation:

“The supporter of heaven, the prop (of the earth), the **Soma**-juice who, widely spreading, filling (the vessels), flows in all directions-- may he unite the two great worlds by his own strength; he has upheld them combined; (may he) the sage (bestow) food upon (his worshippers).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The prop of the earth: cf. RV. 9.089.06; may he unite: yakṣat = saṃyojayatu;

Āvṛta = by its own unaided strength
