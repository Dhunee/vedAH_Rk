## English translation:

“May those (juices) which are in the third world, the world of many streams, unconnected, bestowing progeny, descend; the four digits (of the **Soma**) sent down from heaven bearing water bring the oblation and the nectar.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The four digits: **nābhaḥ** = rays, dīptayaḥ; or, digits (**kalaḥ**) of the Soma; derived from **nābhas**, heaven and the root naḥ, to bind (nābhaḥ = nabhaso bādhikaḥ, obstructing heaven)
