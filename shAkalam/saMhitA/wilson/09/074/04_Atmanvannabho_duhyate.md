## English translation:

“Full of sap the butter and milk is milked from heaven, the bond of the sacrifice, the water is genitive rated; the assembled liberal givers delight him; (the **Soma**-juices) the leaders, the protectors shower down the accusative ulated (water).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The bond: **nābhiḥ** = binding; from naḥ, to bind
