## English translation:

“Thus the **Soma** successfully reaches the white water besprinkled pitcher like a horse (reaching) the goal; the devout (priests) stimulate him with their praise; (he bestows) cattle upon **Kakṣīvat** who has seen a hundred winters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Successfully reaches: sasavān = saṃbhajan, enjoying, possessing; who has seen a hundred winters: śatahimāya = bahugamanāya, i.e. one who attains many things; elsewhere, śatahimāya = aparimita-**kālā**, lasting for an endless time
