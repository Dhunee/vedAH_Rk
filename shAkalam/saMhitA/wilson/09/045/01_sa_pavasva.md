## English translation:

“**Indu**, do you the beholder of men flow plural asantly for the banquet of the gods, for **Indra**'s drinking and exhilaration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Plural asantly: kam = sukham yathā **bhavati** tathā; sometimes, kam is explained just a particle meaning nothing, inserted only to balance the metre of the verse
