## English translation:

“The (**Soma**) flows to **Indra**'s belly for (his) food, giving extreme exhilaration, clothed with vigour, giving good fortune he spreads forth towards all beings; sporting (on the altar), green-tinted, swift-moving, the showerer of benefits, he flows forth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For his food: or, for the sake of getting food for the sacriricer
