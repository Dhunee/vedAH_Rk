## English translation:

“Giver of food, whom the kine praise, you mount, bright-shining, your station fashioned by golden-**hands**; you, **Soma**, the health of the worshippers, increasing (their) abundant food flow for **Indra**, the showerer (of benefits), the giver of exhilaration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whom the kine praise: aghnyaḥ = āhananīha **gāvaḥ**, the kine which are brought to the sacrifice and milked for the curds with which the Soma is mixed, are lowing
