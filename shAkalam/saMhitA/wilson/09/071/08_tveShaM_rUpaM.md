## English translation:

“His ray creates a shining form; at whatever battle it is present, it beats down the adversaries; the giver of water goes with the oblation to the divine people, (it meets) with good praise; (**Soma**) is joined by (a hymn) demanding kine as the chief boon.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His ray: **varṇa** = from vṛ, keeping off, beating back; 'his ray repelling his foes'
