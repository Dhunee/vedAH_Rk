## English translation:

“Radiant, wise, flowing in separate streams, (the **Soma** descends) from the firmament; the shower offered at the three libations responds to the praises (of the worshippers); led in a thousand directions, coming and going, he shines at many a sunrise like one who sings praises (to the gods).”
