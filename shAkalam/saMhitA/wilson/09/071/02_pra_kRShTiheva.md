## English translation:

“The powerful (**Soma**) advances with a roar like a slayer of men; he puts forth that **asura**-slaying tint of his; he abandons bodily infirmity; the food goes to the prepared (altar); he assumes a form advancing to the outstretched (filter).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Asura-slaying tint: i.e., green;or varṇam means 'protecting strength'; the food: i.e., the Soma;

Pituḥ = juice or food;

**Tanā** = in the filter outstretched by the sheep-skin
