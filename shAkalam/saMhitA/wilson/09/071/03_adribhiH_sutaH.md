## English translation:

“Expressed with the stones by the **hands** (the **Soma**) flows; he moves like a bull; (worshipped) with praise he wanders through the firmament; he rejoices, he is embraced; (praised) with a hymn he fulfills (the desire of the worshippers), he is cleansed in the waters, he is honoured at the (god) protected (sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Or, at the sacrifice which nourishes the gods by bestowing oblations on them
