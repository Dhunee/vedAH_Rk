## English translation:

“Like a bull approaching the herbs (**Soma**) roars (as he approaches the praises); he appropriates the lustre of the sun; celestial, flying gracefully he looks down upon the earth; by his wisdom Soma contemplates mankind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Flying gracefully: **suparṇaḥ** = a hawk; supatanaḥ, going gracefully, because it is carried off by **gāyatrī** in the shape of a hawk
