## English translation:

“The **Soma** juice the showerer (of benefits) roaring to the showerer (**Indra**) goes when being purified to (mix with) the glistening milk of the cow; greeted with laudation, cognizant of sacred praise, the hero passes through the filter by a thousand imperishable paths.”
