## English translation:

“(**Soma**) on whom the minds of the gods are fixed, chief (of the gods), recipient of praise, is let loose with a shout by ceremony as (a horse is let loose by the finger) in a battle of chariots; the ten sister (fingers) drive the bearer (of the oblation) on the elevated plural ce to the halls (of sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

On whom the minds of the gods are fixed: tasmin hi teṣām manāṃsyotāni (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.10)
