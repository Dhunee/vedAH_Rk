## English translation:

“Adorable (**Soma**), do you as of old grant the ancient paths to your new worshipper; doer of many acts, utterer of many sounds, may we obtain those (portions) of you which are difficult to defeat, inflicting injury (on foes) and mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Adorable: viśvavāra, who is worthy to be chosen by all
