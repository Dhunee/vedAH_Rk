## English translation:

“Cleaning his person n like a richly-decorated man, flowing to acquire riches like a rapid (horse), rushing to the receptacle like a bull to the herd, (**Soma**) crying repeatedly enters the plural nks.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a richy decorated man: maryo na **śubhraḥ**; the plural nks: the ladles; the soma has already been effused and filtered
