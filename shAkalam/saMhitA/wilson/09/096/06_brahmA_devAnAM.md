## English translation:

“The **Brahmā** of the gods, the guide of the sages, the ṛṣi of the pious, the buffalo of wild animals, the falcon of the vultures, the hatchet of deadly weapons, the **Soma** passes through the filter with a roar.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Brahmā of the gods: i.e., the king of the gods; or, it may mean the **brāhmaṇa** of the priests; the ṛṣi: yaḥ **parokṣam** paśyati sa ṛṣiḥ, ṛsirdarśanāt (**Nirukta** 2.11)
