## English translation:

“The lustres, **Soma**, of you when being purified, approach with abundant milk with copious streams like a woman (giving milk to her child); the green-tinted Soma, the desired of many, has been brought to the waters and cries repeatedly in the pitcher of the god-loving (worshippers).”
