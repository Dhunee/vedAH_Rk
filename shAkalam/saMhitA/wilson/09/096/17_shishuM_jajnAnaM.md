## English translation:

“They cleanse the charming infant (**Soma**) at his birth; the **Maruts** decorate the bearer (of boons) with their troop; bring wise with songs, wise with wisdom, Soma passes clamorous through the filter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Wise with wisdom: there is a plural y on the word, **kavi**; separating gībhiḥ from **kaviḥ**, the explanation is: he passes through the filter with praise
