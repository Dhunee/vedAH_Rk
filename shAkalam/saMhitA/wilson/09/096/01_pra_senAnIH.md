## English translation:

“The leader of the host, a hero, advances in front of the chariots intent on seizing the cattle (of the enemy); his army exults; making their oblations to **Indra** prosperous for the friendly (worshippers), **Soma** assumes the hastily made robes (of curds and milk).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hastily made: rabhasāni = indrasya vegenāgame nimittāni,?caused by Indra's hasty arrival
