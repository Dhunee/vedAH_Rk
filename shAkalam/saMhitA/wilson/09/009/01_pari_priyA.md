## English translation:

“The seer (**Soma**) having wise designs, when plural ced between the two boards and effused, proceeds to the stones which are most dear to heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Sāmaveda** has svanaiḥ for suvānaḥ; between the two boards: liṭ, between the two grand-daughters, naptyoḥ. Terms of relationship are used in the **Veda** often to imply material objects; e.g. 'sisters' are 'fingers. Here, the two boards are a reference to the two boards used in pressing the Soma; another interpretation is that they imply two **hands**; proceeds to the stones: vayāṃsi; alternative rendering: the seer is plural ced between the hands as a most dear banquet to heaven; the knower of the past (or the wise in sacrifice) goes forth effused
