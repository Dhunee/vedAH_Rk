## English translation:

“May the battle-axe of the foe destroy the foe; alone flow tous, bright **Soma**; (slay) the villain only, bright Soma.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The battle-axe: **paraśuḥ** = chedakaḥ **pavamānaḥ**, as if Soma were metaphorically called a battle-axe and implored to turn his edge against foes only (tam eva śatrum nāśayatu)
