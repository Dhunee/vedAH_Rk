## English translation:

“He who reads the hymns to **Pavamāna**, the essence (of the **Veda**) collected by the ṛṣis, enjoys all (his food) purified, sweetened by **Mātariśvan**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mātariśvan = Va+yu, because it breathes in the atmosphere, antarikṣe śvasiti; the food is sweetened and purified by the purifying wind and the man eats it
