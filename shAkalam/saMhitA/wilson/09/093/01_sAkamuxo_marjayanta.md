## English translation:

“The sister (fingers) sprinkling together cleanse (the **Soma**), the ten fingers (are) the efffuse of the sagacious (Soma); the green-tinted one flows round the wives of the sun, he hastens like a swift horse to the pitcher.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The wives of the sun: jaḥ = **jayaḥ**; the quarters of the horizon are called the sun's wives because they are made manifest by the light of the sun
