## English translation:

“And he nourishes the cow's udder; the intelligent **Indu** is associated with his stream; the cows clothe the elevated **Soma** in the ladles with their milk as with newly washed robes.”

Nourish the cow's udder: the Soma entering the herbs, etc., nourishes the cow who eats them
