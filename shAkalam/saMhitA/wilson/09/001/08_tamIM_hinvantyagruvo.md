## English translation:

“The fingers press the **Soma**, they squeeze it glittering like a water-skin; its juice becomes threefold, enemy-averting.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Its juice becomes threefold = tridhātu = liṭ, in three plural ces; or, as filling the three vessels, the droṇakalaśa, the **āhavanīya** and the pūtabhṛt
