## English translation:

“This is the **Soma**, the conqueror of thousands, who flows stimulating the rapid voice (of the priests), awakened at dawn; **Indu** sends forth his ocean and sinks into the pitchers into **Indra**'s heart.”

I.e., aindrasya hārdi, in such a way that Indra's heart is friendly
