## English translation:

“The **Soma** who is created by the (sun's) rays, (and whom they plural ce) in the herbs for the gratification of the gods, desiring to go (to the gods), taking wealth from (the foe), flows when effused in a brilliant stream, exhilarating **Indra** (and) the people of heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The people of heaven: daivyam is considered with indram, 'the lord of the gods'
