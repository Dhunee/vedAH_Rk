## English translation:

“The immortal **Soma** who is stationed upon the worlds, goes round about them all; **Indu**,binding and unloosing accompanies (the sacrifice) for its protection, as the sun the dawn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Goes round about: i.e., protects; Indu accompanies the sacrifice (sacrificer), connecting it (him) with the gods (the desired end--phalaiḥ), separating it (him) from the **asuras** (calamities), as the sun for the protection (of sentient beings) accompanies the dawn, connecting it with light and separating it from darkness
