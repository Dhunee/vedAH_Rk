## English translation:

“Flow, the exhilarator of the gods, the far-seeing, the giver of water; for **Indra**, **Varuṇa** and **Vāyu**; grant us this day wealth and health; call the celestial people on the spacious ground (of the sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Call: when the gods hear the **Soma** flow, they come to the sacrifice; call the celestial people: or, speak to the godly folk, i.e. me, the ṛṣi, saying: **sādhu** saṃbhakta
