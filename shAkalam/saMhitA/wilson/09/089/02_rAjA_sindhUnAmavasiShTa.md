## English translation:

“The sovereign **Soma** has put on the vestment of the waters, he has ascended the most straight-going ship of sacrifice; the dripping juice brought by the falcon has increased in the water; the father milks him-- milks him the son of the father.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The father milks him: **pitā** (pālako lokāḥ) = **Adhvaryu**, who extracts the juice of the Soma which is born from the heaven as from a father; or, the first milk may be the **yajamāna** and the second the adhvaryu; or duhe may be repeated as a mark of respect
