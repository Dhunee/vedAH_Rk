## English translation:

“I (delight) in your presence, tawny-coloured **Soma**, both day and night, for the sake of your friendship may we soar like birds far beyond the sun blazing with your light.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Sāmaveda** has tavāham for utāham; duhanaḥ for sakhyāya; far beyond the sun: **paraḥ** is an adjective for sūryam;

Sūryam = soma, may we fly to you, the distant sun
