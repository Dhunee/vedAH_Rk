## English translation:

“**Soma** combined with the produce of the kine flows with the kine into the pitcher, he flows with the milked kine; his enjoyable juices go (to the pitcher as waters) to the ocean, the exhilarating (Soma) is expressed for the exhilaration (of the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Into the pitcher: anupe = on the bank; or, in a watery low-lying plural ce, nimne deśe
