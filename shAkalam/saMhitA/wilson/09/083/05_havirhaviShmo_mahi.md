## English translation:

“Possessed of water, you go clothed in the liquid water, to the great celestial abode to (take) the sacrifice; as king you ascend to the battle, mounted to your filter-chariot; armed with a thousand weapons you win (us) abundant food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the liquid water: **haviḥ** in contrast to **nabhaḥ**; to the battle: i.e., the sacrifice
