## English translation:

“The **gandharva** verily protects this station; the marvellous (**Soma**) preserves the races of the gods; the lord of cattle seizes (our enemy) with a snare, the doers of good attain the drinking of the sweet-juiced (Soma).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The lord of cattle: nidhāpatiḥ (the lord of snares) = nidhipatiḥ (the lord of treasure)
