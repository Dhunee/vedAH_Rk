## English translation:

“Shining, he cries aloud (descending) into the vessels, pressed by the priests into the golden receptacle; the milk of the sacrifice glorify him; the supporter of the three sacrifices shines (most) on the days of sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The milk of the sacrifice: 'the priests milk the stones as calves (milk the cows)' (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 6.2.11.4).
