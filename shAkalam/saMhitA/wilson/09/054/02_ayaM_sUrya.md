## English translation:

“He like the sun is the supervisor (of all acts); he hastens to the lakes, he unites with the seven down-descending rivers from heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To the lakes: i.e. the thirty **uktha** **pātras** (vessels or libations offering the recitation of the uktha), or thirty days and nights (Niruktam 5.11)
