## English translation:

“Descending rivers follow this excellent (**Soma**) as it spreads out the sacrifice; this rits is glorified thereby.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As it spreads out the sacrifice: tantum = yajñam; or, alternatively, straining-cloth; 'descending river fills out the outspread threads'
