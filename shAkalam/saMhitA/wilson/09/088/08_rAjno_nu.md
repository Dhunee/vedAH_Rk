## English translation:

“Your acts are (like) those of the royal **Varuṇa**, vast and profound, **Soma**, is your abode; you are pure as the beloved **Mitra**, munificent are you, Soma, as **Aryaman**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Varuṇa: 'I quickly perform the sacrifices of you the cover';

Varuṇa = **varāka**
