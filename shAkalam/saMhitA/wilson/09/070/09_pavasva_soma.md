## English translation:

“Flow **Soma**, the showerer, for the banquet for the gods; enter the Soma-vessel dear to **Indra**; bring us safe past the hostile (**rākṣasas**) before the oppress us; for he who knows the country tells the direction to him who asks (the way).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He who knows the country: 'as by telling him he protects (helps) him, so do you who know the roads of the sacrifice protect us by telling us the sacrificial paths'
