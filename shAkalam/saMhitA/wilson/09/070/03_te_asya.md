## English translation:

“May those his immortal, inviolable rays protect both classes of beings, wherewith he stimulates human (strength) and divine (food); thereupon praises reach the royal (**Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Both classes of beings: the movable and stationary or animate and inanimate creation; or, men and gods; 'the Soma fertilizes the plural nts at the sacrifice, and streams of men flow forth', the plural nts being part of the stationary (**sthāvara**) creation, and men belonging to the movable (**jaṅgama**)
