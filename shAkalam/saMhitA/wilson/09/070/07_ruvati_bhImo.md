## English translation:

“The formidable showerer, the contemplator of all through desire for strength roars, sharpening his green-tinted horns; the **Soma** settles on his well-prepared station; the cowhide is his cleanser and the sheep-skin (too).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His green-tinted horns: i.e., the streams of the Soma juice
