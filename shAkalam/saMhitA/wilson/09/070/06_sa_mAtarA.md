## English translation:

“He repeatedly beholding his parents (heaven and earth) proceeds with a loud noise, like cows (looking at their calves and lowing), and with a roar (like the troop) of **Maruts**; knowing that water to be the best which is good for all men, the intelligent (**pavamāna**) chose man to be the offerer of his praise.”
