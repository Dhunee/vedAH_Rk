## English translation:

“Being filtered for **Indra**'s world-supporting strength, stationed in the midst of both worlds he goes (everywhere); the showerer destroys the evil-minded by his vigour, challenging the **asuras** like an archer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Asuras: śurudhaḥ = **śucā** rundhanti parān, they avert painfrom others;

Śaryāha = haananasādhanair iṣubirhantā **vīraḥ**; in RV. 67.16.39, **śarya** = an enemy;

Śarya = an arrow, paṇaiḥ śatrūṇām **hantā**
