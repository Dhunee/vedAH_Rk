## English translation:

“Cleansed by the ten well-working (fingers), the companion (of the waters) stands among the midmost mothers to measure (the worlds); the beholder of men protecting sacred rites (for the sake) of auspicious ambrosia looks after both races.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Among the midmost mothers: mātṛṣu;

Madhyamāsu = plural ced in the atmosphere; look after both races: gods and men, i.e., 'men by granting them their desires, gods by bestowing oblations upon them'
