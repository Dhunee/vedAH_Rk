## English translation:

“As a wife to her husband, so you (afford) delight to your worshipper; (**Soma**), offspring of Pajra, listen (to the praises) I address to you; in the midst of our adorations advance to grant us life; Soma, who are irreproachable, be vigilant against (our) foe.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pajra: i.e., the earth; Soma is its offspring, because it is produced in the ground
