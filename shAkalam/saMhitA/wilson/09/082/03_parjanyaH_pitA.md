## English translation:

“The mighty winged (**Soma**) whose father is **Parjanya** has plural ced his dwelling on the navel of the earth among the mountains; the sisters, the waters flow to (the produce of) the kine; he meets with the stones at the beloved sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parjanya: i.e., the rain; **somaḥ** is implied in mahiṣasya parṇinaḥ and is the subject of dadhe. The mountains are the grinding-stones; the navel of the earth is the oblation. **svasaraḥ** = fingers
