## English translation:

“Sending us rain from heaven, quick-falling, food-giving, giving health to our home, promptly munificent; flow, **Indu**, seeking these lower winds your kinsmen as (one seeking his) beloved infants.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Giving health to our home: śaṃgayīm = sakhasya nivāsabhūtam, inhabiting happiness; the kinsmen: because **Indra** and the winds are in the relation of praised and praiser; **imān** vāyūn = us approaching you, asmān tvām abhigacchataḥ
