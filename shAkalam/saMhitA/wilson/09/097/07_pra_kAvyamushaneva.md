## English translation:

“Reciting sacred praise like Uṣanas the praiser (Vṛṣagaṇa) proclaims the births of the gods; assiduous in pious observances, of brilliant radiance, purifying (from sin), he approaches the filter making a noise (as) a wild boar (makes a noise) with its foot.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The praiser: **devaḥ** = **Soma**; as a wild boar makes a noise with its foot: **varāhaḥ** = effused on a good (**vara**) day (**ahan**)-- epithet of Soma;

**Pada** = padāni, abodes, i.e., the filters
