## English translation:

“The purified (**Soma**) approaches (**Indra**) as the year (approaches) the sun, he fills both heaven and earth (with his radiance), he opens (the darkness with his light); may he, the beloved (Soma), whose beloved (streams) are for (our) preservation, bestow upon us wealth like (wages given) to a labourer.”
