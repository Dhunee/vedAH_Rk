## English translation:

“May the **Soma** juices which are gratifying to the gods when poured around (into the vessels) bring us a dwelling and **male** offspring-- (the juice) endeavouring to gain the favour (of the gods), desired by all offering (to the gods) in heaven like the ministrant priests, most exhilarating.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Endeavouring to gain the favour of the gods: āyajyavaḥ sumatim viśvavārāḥ
