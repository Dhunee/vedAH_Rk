## English translation:

“He moves rapidly (following) the path of (him) the much-praised, (other) goers cannot overtake him (though he is) moving easily; sharp-horned he displays manifold (radiance); the **Soma** appears green-tinted by day, and clearly visible at night.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Soma appears green-tinted by day: Soma is not visible in the daylight;

Ṛjra = straight going, ṛju-gāmī, i.e., clearly visible, **vispaṣṭaḥ** = red or brown
