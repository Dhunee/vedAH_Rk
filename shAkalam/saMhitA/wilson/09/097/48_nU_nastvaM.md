## English translation:

“Divine **Soma**, who are car-borne, being filtered (at) our (sacrifice), flow quickly into the cups; most sweet-flavoured in the waters, full of delight, offered at the sacrifice, stimulator of all, who like a god are the object of true praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Flow quickly into the cups: camvoḥ = adhiśavṇa phalakayoḥ; apsu is related with **parisrava**
