## English translation:

“When the praise of the zealous worshipper sanctiies him as that of a noisy (crowd) in front (praises) a distinguished (prince) for the support (he affords); then the cows come to the excellent exhilarating **Indu**, the lord (of all, abiding) in the pitcher, eager to gratify him (with their milk).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For the support he affords: dharmaṇi = the reason (**nimitta**) of the praise; i.e. the duty of acquisition and preservation (or the duty of securing property), **yogakṣema** viṣayam **karma**
