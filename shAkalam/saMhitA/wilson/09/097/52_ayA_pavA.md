## English translation:

“With this filtered stream pour on us those treasures; do you, **Indu**, advance to the brown water; at this rite may the sun, rapid as the wind, may (**Indra**) the object of many sacrifices grant a son to me approaching (the **Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Advance to the brown water: māṃścatva = manyamānānām cātake, 'scaring away (?) those who are respectful';

Badhraḥ = the illuminator of all or the root of all--the sun
