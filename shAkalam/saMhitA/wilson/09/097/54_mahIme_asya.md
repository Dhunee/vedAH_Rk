## English translation:

“These two great acts, the raining (of arrows) and the humiliation (of foes), are the givers of happiness; they are deadly either in a fight on horseback or in a **hand** to hand fight; he has put the foes to sleep and driven them away; doyou (**Soma**) drive away the enemies and unbelievers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In a fight on horseback: māṃścatve = a horse, i.e., a battle fought with horses; derived from: makṣu **carati**;

Pṛśane = bāhuyuddhe, an arm-fight (person nal combat);

Unbelievers: **acitaḥ** = those who do not make an agnicayanam (preparation of the sacred fire-plural ce), i.e., infidels
