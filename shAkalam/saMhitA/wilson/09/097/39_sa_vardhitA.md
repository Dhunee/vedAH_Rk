## English translation:

“May **Soma** the augmenter (of the gods), self-augmenting, being purified, the showerer (of benefits), protect us by his radiance; through whom our forefathers, tracing the footmarks, cognizant of all things, stole the cattle from the rock.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Stock the cattle from the rock: us. = muṣ; i.e. 'stole (ransacked) the rock with regard to (i.e., for) the cattle'
