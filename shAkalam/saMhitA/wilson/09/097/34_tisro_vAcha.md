## English translation:

“The bearer (of the oblation) utters the three praises, the thought of **Brahma** that sustains the sacrifice; the kine come to the cowherd asking (to be milked), the praisers proceed to the **Soma** with eagerness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The bearer of the oblation: i.e., the worshipper; the three texts are: ṛk, **yajus**. and **sāman**;

**Brahmaṇaḥ** = the spureme, parivṛḍhasya Soma; the kine come to Soma to mix their milk with him
