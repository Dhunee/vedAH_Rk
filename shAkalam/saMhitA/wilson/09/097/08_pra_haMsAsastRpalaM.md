## English translation:

“The Vṛṣagaṇas (walking like) swans, (alarmed) at the strength (of the foe), having repaired to the house of sacrifice, to the swift-shooting foe-despising (**Soma**), the friends sound the flut to the praiseworthy irresistble **Pavamāna**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Walking like swans: haṃsāsaḥ = wounded by the enemy;

Amāt = śatrūṇām balāt trāsitāḥ **santaḥ**; another interpretation: the vṛṣagaṇas have gone from hence to their home
