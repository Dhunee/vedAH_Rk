## English translation:

“We clothe with praise that **Soma** who is the inspirer of praise, the purified, the shepherd of men.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

'**Mādhava**, however, takes vācam as a separate word and as a verb, and divides the line into two sentences'. He would explain it, 'I address him with praises; we cover (with milk, etc.) Soma who is the purified inspirer, the cow-keeper of men'. The shepherd of men: liṭ, the herdsman of men, janasya gopatim
