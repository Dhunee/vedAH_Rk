## English translation:

“When effused the **Soma** juice flows to the woollen (filter) as (a warrior) in a chariot is covered in mail; fitted into the wooden (cask), hurrying forth, it flows in streams.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To the woollen filter: druṇā = hiyānaḥ (tena pūryamāṇaḥ);

**Hitaḥ** = sent forth on all sides; or, praised by the worshippers
