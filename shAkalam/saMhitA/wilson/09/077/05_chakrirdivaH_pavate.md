## English translation:

“The maker of all, clever in work, the juice, mighty unassailable **Varuṇa** flows from heaven for the sake of him who go hither and thither; the friend of the adorable (**Soma**) is effused in affliction uttering a sound like an ardent horse amidst a herd (of mares). \[”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The maker of all, clever in work, the juice, mighty unassailable Varuṇa flows from heaven for the sake of him who go hither and thither; the friend of the adorable (Soma) is effused in affliction uttering a sound like an ardent horse amidst a herd (of mares). \[
