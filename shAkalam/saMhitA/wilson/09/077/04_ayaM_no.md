## English translation:

“May this **Indu**, praised of many, knowing those who desire to slay us, slay them with united mind; who being in the dwelling of the lord (**Agni**) deposits a germ (in the herds) and hastens to (our) milk-giving herd of cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Milk-giving: urubja = from uru+ap+jan, producing abundant water (milk)
