## English translation:

“The ancient (**Soma**) flows, which the hawk, despatched (for the purpose), brought down from heaven passing through the (third) world; he detaches the sweet-flavoured (Soma) flying downwards, with mind full of fear of the archer **Kṛśānu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He detaches: saḥ = Soma; a reference to the hawk, who is afraid of Kṛśānu, the protector of Soma. The legend is in **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 3.26
