## English translation:

“The sweet-flavoured beverage sounds in the pitcher, the thunderbolt of **Indra**, more beautiful than the beautiful; (the stream) of this veracious (**Soma**) approach yielding much milk, dropping water, lowing like kine (laden) with milk.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

More beautiful: vapuṣo vapuṣṭaraḥ = sowing seed more than any other sower of seed
