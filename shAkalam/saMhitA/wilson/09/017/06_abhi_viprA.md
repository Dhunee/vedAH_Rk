## English translation:

“The sage performers (of pious rites) glorify (the **Soma**) at the head of the sacrifice, entertaining affection for him the all-beholding.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the head of the sacrifice: **mūrdhan** yajñasya = on the last day of expressing the Soma; all-beholding: cakṣasi = draṣṭari some; this is usually applied to the sun as the eye of the world
