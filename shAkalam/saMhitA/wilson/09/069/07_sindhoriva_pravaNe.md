## English translation:

“The exhilarating (**Soma**-juices) poured forth by the sprinklers effect their way to **Indra** as in a waterfall of a river the percvading (waters find their way) to dry ground; bless on our return our two-footed and four-footed things; may food and offspring ever abide with us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the sprinklers: Or, praised by the priests who give the Soma; On our return: niveśe = svagṛham **prati** praveśane nirgamane vā, on our entering our home or leavin git; dvipade, catuṣpade are datives from -pad
