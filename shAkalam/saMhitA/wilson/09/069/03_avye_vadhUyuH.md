## English translation:

“(**Soma**) seeking his spouse is filtered in the sheep-skin; he separates his grand-daughter on the earth for the sacrificer; green-tinted, adorable, collected (in the ladles), exhilarating, he overcomes (his foes); sharpening his vigour he shines like one of might.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His spouse: i.e., the herbs, naptiḥ = naptṛh, i.e. the fourth genitive ration. **Prajāpati** begets the gods; the gods beget the rain; the rain begets the herbs; Or, it means the offspring of Soma; Soma nourishes the herbs with his rays. Soma 'separates' the herbs at the lip to make them fruitful (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.1.3); ṛtam yāte = yajñam gacchate, i.e., yajamānāya
