## English translation:

“The praise is united (to **Indra**); the excellent (**Soma**) is sprinkled; (the Soma stream) emitting plural asant juice is driven into (Indra's) mouth; the filtered diffused exhilarating swift-flowing (Soma) hastens to the fleece like the arrow of the combatants.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Diffuseṣ..arrow: santaniḥ: as an adjective with **somaḥ**, i.e. diffused in the ladles; as a noun, the arrow discharged (by the foe)
