## English translation:

“The bull lows, the cows flow around him; the divine (praises) gather round the station of the radiant (**Soma**); Soma passes through the white sheep-skin; he clothes himself with it as it were a burnished armouṛ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The first part of the verse praises Soma; Soma at the time of entering the wooden vessels makes a noise; the cows, the propitiating hymns of praise, gather round him; the hymns of praise approach the god's station.
