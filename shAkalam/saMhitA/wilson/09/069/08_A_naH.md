## English translation:

“Pour upon us (wealth) comprising treasure, gold, horses, cattle, barley, and excellent **male** offspring; you, **Soma** are my progenitors, the chiefs of heaven, plural ced (for sacrificial), the offerers of oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You, Soma are...: Soma is treated as a plural ral by attraction; or, as the plural rality of the **pitṛs** is applied to Soma
