## English translation:

“(Our) praise is attached (to **Indra**) as an arrow to the bow; (the **Soma**-juice) is let loose to (Indra) the fosterer as a calf to the udder to its mother; (Indra sheds blessings) as a cow having a copious stream of milk yields it when coming into the presence (of the calf); in Indra's sacrifices the Soma is stimulated.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The fosterer: ūdhani = Indra, because he is the nourisher of everything
