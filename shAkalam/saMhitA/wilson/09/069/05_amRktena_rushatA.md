## English translation:

“The immortal green-tinted **Soma** when purified is arranged in an uncleaned shining vestment; he ahs created (**Āditya**) who stands on the back of the sky for the destruction (of sin) and purification, (and has created) Āditya's brilliance, the cover of the two worlds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shining vestment: i.e., the milk; Āditya's brilliance: nabhasmayam = ādityamayam ādityasya svabhūtam **tejas**
