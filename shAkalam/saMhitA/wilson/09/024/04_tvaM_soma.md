## English translation:

“You, **Soma**, who are the exhilarator of men, flow to (**Indra**), the conqueror of enemies, you who are pure and to be worshipped.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The conqueror of enemies: **Sāmaveda** replaces carṣaṇīdhṛtiḥ for carṣaṇīsahe, i.e. an epithet of Soma, 'laid hold of by men', or 'the protection of men'
