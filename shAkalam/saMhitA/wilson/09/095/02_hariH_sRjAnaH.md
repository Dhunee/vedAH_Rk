“The green-tinted **Soma** being let loose propels the voice that indicates the path of truth as the boatman (propels his) boat; the bright Soma reveals to his worshipper on the sacred grass the secret names of the god. \[”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The green-tinted Soma being let loose propels the voice that indicates the path of truth as the boatman (propels his) boat; the bright Soma reveals to his worshipper on the sacred grass the secret names of the god. \[
