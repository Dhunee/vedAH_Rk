## English translation:

“(The priests) milk forth the **Soma** cleansed (dwelling) on a high plural ce like a buffalo, the sprinkler, plural ces between the grinding-stones; praises attend upon the longing Soma; (**Indra**) who dwells in three abodes supports him, the defeater of enemies, in the firmament.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The priests milk forth: grāvaṇo **vatsā** ṛtvijo duhanti (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā**: 6.2.11.4); who dwells in three abodes: or, **tritaḥ** may be an epithet of **somaḥ**; varuṇam may be an epithet of indram
