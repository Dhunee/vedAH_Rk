## English translation:

“**Indu**, being purified, stimulating the praise (of the worshippers) like the answer of the **hotā** set free the understanding; when (you) and **Indra** are present together (at the sacrifice) may we be prosperous, may we become the possessors of excellent **male** progeny.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Set free the understanding: i.e., make his (?Indra's) mind favourably disposed to grant wealth
