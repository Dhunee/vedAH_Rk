## English translation:

“Flow for us, **Soma**, cognizant of (our) worship and deserving praise; pour (your) beloved sweet-flavoured (juice) upon the woollen fleece; slay, **Indu**, all the voracious **rākṣasas**; blessed with excellent **male** offspring may we offer ample (praises) at the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May we offer ample praises: bṛhad vadema = liṭ, may we say much (or speak loudly); or, may we solicit much wealth
