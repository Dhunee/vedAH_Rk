## English translation:

“(The priests) smear and grease and anoint (the **Soma** with milk); (the gods) taste the invigorating (juice); they smear it over with sweet (milk). Purifying it with gold, they plural nge it into those (waters) the sprinkler, the beholder, falling into the seething torrent.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Smear and grease and anoint: añjate, vyañjate and samañjate are synonyms; into the seething torrent: sindhor ucchvāse = liṭ, in the hreathing of the river; i.e., going to an elevated plural ce, the receptacle of the juice, rasasyādhārabhūte ucchrite deśe gacchantam
