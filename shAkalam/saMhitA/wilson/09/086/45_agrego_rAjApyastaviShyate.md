## English translation:

“(**Soma**) going foremost, radiant, sanctified by water, plural ced in the firmament as the measure of days is glorified; green-tinted, shedding water, of goodly aspect, the source of moisture, borne in a chariot of light he flows giving wealth, friendly to the house.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The measure of days: beacause, the rule as to the length of day depends on the increase and decrease of the moon's digits, Soma being here regarded as the moon
