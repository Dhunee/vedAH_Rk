## English translation:

“The light of the sacrifice, he distils sweet (juice) delightful (to the gods), the parent of the gods, the genitive rator (of all), possessed of ample wealth; he supports the hidden wealth of heaven and earth, the most exhilarating, the exciting (**Soma**), the nourisher of (**Indra**), the juice.”
