## English translation:

“(**Soma**), who first reached **Indra**'s glorious body, gives great happiness to the entrance of Indra (that Soma), whose station is in the highest heaven, and through whom (Indra) triumphs in all contests.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Through whom: ataḥ = yasmāt somāt (**tṛpta** **indraḥ**); 'since his (Soma's) station is in the highest heaven, therefore he (Soma) triumphs'
