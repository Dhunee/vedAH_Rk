## English translation:

“Like a horse urged on to battle, do you who are all-knowing rush from heaven to the receptacle whose mother is the cloud; **Soma** the showerer (of benefits) is being purified at the top upon the woollen filter for **Indra**'s strength which supports (the world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For Indra's strength: dhāyase = dhārakāya; or, 'to Indra's supporting', i.e. to support Indra
