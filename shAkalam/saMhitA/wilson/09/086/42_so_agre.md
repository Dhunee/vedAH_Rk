## English translation:

“At the beginning of the day the green-tinted delightful exhilarating (**Soma**) is recognized by the intelligence (of the praisers) and by their praises; approaching the two men he passes in the midst (of heaven and earth, bestowing) upon the upholder (of the rite) both human and divine (riches).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The two men: i.e., the praiser and the worshipper; or, secular and sacred people (laukikavaidikau)
