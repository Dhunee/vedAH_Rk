## English translation:

“The supporter of heaven the prepared exhilarating (**Soma**) is let loose, the triple (beverage) rushes to the waters; the worshippers taste the sounding Soma juice, when the reciters of holy texts approach the embodied (beverage) with praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Triple beverage: tridhātu = three vessle, the droṇakalaśa, **āhavanīya** and putabhṛt; or, just, three metallic ores: gold, silver, lead/coopper
