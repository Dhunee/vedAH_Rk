## English translation:

“Urged (by the priests) the genitive rator of heaven and earth advances like a chariot, wishing to distribute food; going to **Indra**, sharpening his weapons, holding all treasures in his **hands**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Advances: prayacchati, bestows; **Soma** is the genitive rator of earth by giving rain, and of heaven by obtaining the oblation
