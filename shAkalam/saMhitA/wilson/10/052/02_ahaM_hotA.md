## English translation:

“Best entitled to the sacrifice, I have sat down as the **Hotā**; all the divine **Maruts** urge me( to bear theoblation); the office of the **Adhvaryu** is to be discharged daily, **Aśvins**, by you; let the moon be the **brahman**, andlet it be also your oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The moon: samidh = fuel; or, the moon, identical with **Soma**, which is the oblation;three chief priests are present: **agni** is the hotā, aśvins the adhvaryu, and soma the **brahmā**
