“The gods have made me the bearer of oblations returning after departure, and passing many difficultplaces; (saying) this **Agni** is wise; he will accomplish the sacrifice for us, whether it be that of the five ways, thethree kinds, or the seven threads.”

Five ways: a reference to the pāṅkta **yajña**; of three kinds: the three dailySoma libations; seven threads: seven metres of the **mantras**; or, having seven performers
