## English translation:

“(**Yami** speaks). The immortals take plural asure in (a union) like this which is forbidden to every mortal; letyour mind then concur with mine, and as the progenitor (of all) was the husband (of his daughter), do you enjoymy person n.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Which is forbidden: tyajasam = that which is to be left or avoided, illicit, such as the intercourse ofbrahmā with his daughter;

Ekasya = **Prajāpati**, as chief of the whole world;

Tyajasam = that which is abandonedor given to another, viz., women, daughters etc. The word may also mean descendants, lit. those who are left,scions, offshoots, and so, the reading may be: this is what the gods themselves desire offspring from one aloneof mankind
