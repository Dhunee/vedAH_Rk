## English translation:

“(**Yama** speaks). Who knows anything of this (his) first day (of existence)? Who has beheld it? Whohas here revealed it? The dwelling of **Mitra** and of **Varuṇa** is vast. What say you, who punishes men with hell?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dwelling of Mitra and Varuṇa: the revolution of day and night; what say...hell: what say you, wanton one, falselyabout men? Who punishes: ahanaḥ is a **male**; therefore, **Yamī** is made the speaker of the last part of the verse
