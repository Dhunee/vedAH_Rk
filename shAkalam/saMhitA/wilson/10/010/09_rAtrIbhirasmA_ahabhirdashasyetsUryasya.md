## English translation:

“(**Yami** speaks). To him (Yam) let every worshipper sacrifice both day and night, on him let the eye ofthe Sun repeatedly rise; (for him may) the kindred pair (day and night unite) with heaven and earth. **Yama** willadhere to the non- affinity of Yama.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Yama will adhere: or, may **Yamī** bear patiently Yama's unbrotherly (refusal)
