## English translation:

“The maker of the senses, resolute in mind, engendered the water, (and then) these two (heaven andearth) floating (on the waters); when those ancient boundaries were fixed, then the heaven and earth wereexpanded.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The maker of the senses: liṭ, the father of the eye; **manasā** **dhīraḥ** = reflecting that there was noone equal to himself; āpo vā idam agre; āpa eva sasarjādau: **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 7.1.5.1; **Manu** 1.8
