## English translation:

“You know not him who has genitive rated these (beings); (his life) is another, different from yours;wrapped in fog, and foolish speech (do they) wander (who are) gluttonous and engaged in devotion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Sāyaṇa**:"The assertion that we know **Viśvakarman** in the same way as men say, 'I am **devadatta**, I am **yajñadatta**', isfalse, for the essence (**tattva**) of Viśvakarman **Parameśvara** is not endowed with conscious individual existence,but he is a different entity from you who are sentient beings, who have individual consciousness, and so forth".Wrapped in foolish speech: jalpyā: i.e., saying I am god, I am man etc.;

Ukthaśāsaḥ = singing hymns with aview to gaining felicity in a future state: you are merely anxious for enjoyment in this world and in the next,therefore you know nothing of Viśvakarman; or, you who are engaged in enjoyment of this world or the next,being subject to false knowledge or ignorance, have no knowledge of the Truth
