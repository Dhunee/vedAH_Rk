## English translation:

“**Indra**, lord of abundant wealth, we, desiring wealth, seize hold of your right **hand**; we know you, hero,lord of abundant cattle, give us various fertilizing riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Vaikuṇṭha**: the legend: **Vikuṇṭha** was a feminine le **asura**,who, desiring to have a son like Indra, performed penance (the **kṛcchra** and cādrāyaṇa etc.) for the purpose.Indra, wishing that there should not be another like himself, took upon him the state of the embryo of Vikuṇṭha,and was born as her son; give uṣ..riches: this refrain occurs in each ṛca: citram is variously explained as :desirable, honourable; vṛṣaṇam as fertilizing or a son
