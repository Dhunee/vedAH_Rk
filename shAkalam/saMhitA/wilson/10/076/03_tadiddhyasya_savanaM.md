## English translation:

“May this (sacrificial) work of this grinding-stone the effusion of the **Soma**, spread as it went formerlyalong the path to **Manu**; when the son of **Tvaṣṭā**, hidden by the (stolen) cows, and assuming the form of ahorse, (was to be slain), the worshippers had recourse at the sacrifices to the inviolable (upper grinding-stones).”
