## English translation:

“The swiftly-moving grinding-stones effuse the **Soma**, desiring praise, they milk forth Soma; they milkforth for the spinkling (of **Agni**); the leaders (of rites) purify the oblations with their mouths.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With their mouths: bydevouring the refuse; or, metaphorically, by the praise of their mouths
