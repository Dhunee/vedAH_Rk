## English translation:

“Eat abundant fodder in the pasture, O cows, who are anointed in the hall of sacrifice in the cow-stall;may (your) body be the remedy for (our) body. We long for the universal **Aditi**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e., may the body of the cowoffered in sacrifice be the expiation for the body of the sacrificer, enabling him to attain **svarga**; or, may the milkbe the corrective of the **Soma**; or, may the body itself be the body's cure
