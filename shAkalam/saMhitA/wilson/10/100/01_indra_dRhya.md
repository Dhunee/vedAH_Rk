## English translation:

“Consume, afluent **Indra**, (the foe that is) like you (in might); praised on this occasion, do you who arethe drinker of the libation be favourable to our advancement. May **Savitā**, with the gods, defend our sacrifice;we long for the universal **Aditi**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aditi: sarvatāti = all; or, all-pervading, from tai, to extend
