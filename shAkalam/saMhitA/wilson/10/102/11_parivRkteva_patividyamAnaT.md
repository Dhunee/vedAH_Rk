## English translation:

“As a wife who has been abandoned rejoices to find her husband, as a cloud expanding when pouringforth rain with the aid of the earth's disc; with her eager (to recover the cattle) for our charioteer, may we win (theprize), may good fortune, together with food, be given to us.”
