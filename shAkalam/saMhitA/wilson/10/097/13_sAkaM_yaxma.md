## English translation:

“Fly forth, sickness, with the jay, with the blue jay, with the velocity of the wind, perish along with theiguana.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Iguana: kikidīvinā: an epithet of cāṣeṇa, making these **kiki**; perhaps, an allusion to the severaldiseases arising from vitiated **bile**, phlegm and wind (**Yajuṣ**)
