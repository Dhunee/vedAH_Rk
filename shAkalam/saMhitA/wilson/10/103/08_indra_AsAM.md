## English translation:

“May **Indra** be the leader of these (hosts), may **Bṛhaspati**, **Dakṣiṇā**, **Yajña**, and **Soma** go before, letthe **Maruts** march in the van of the destroying and victorious armies of the gods.”

Dakṣiṇā: not a proper name;may the **yajña- puruṣa** (i.e., **Viṣṇu**) go on the right and Soma go before
