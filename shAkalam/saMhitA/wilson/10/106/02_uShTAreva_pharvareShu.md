## English translation:

“Like two longing oxen (to the pastures), you have recourse to those who fill you (with oblations); youapproach like two horses prepared for the fray; employed to bring treasure; you are like two (royal) messengersrenowned among the people; turn not away (from our oblation) like two buffaloes from the drinking-trough.”
