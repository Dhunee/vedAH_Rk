## English translation:

“Fierce (**Aśvins**), like two powerful (heroes), you enable this moving, perishable mortal (frame) to crossover to the objects (of its destination) as over water; extremely strong, like the **Ṛbhus**, your chariot attained itsdestination swift as the wind, it pervaded (everywhere), it dispensed riches.”
