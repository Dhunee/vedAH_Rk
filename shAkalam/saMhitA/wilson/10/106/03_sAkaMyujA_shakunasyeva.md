## English translation:

“Connected toegether like the two wings of a bird, you came to the sacrifice like two choice animals;radiant as **Agni** (at the offering) of the devout (worshipper), like two perambulating priests you celebrate worshipin many plural ces.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You celebrate worship: the **Aśvins** are the **Adhvaryus** of the gods
