## English translation:

“May we increase our praise, ( **Aśvins**), may we offer you food, come hither in the same chariot to ourworship; and accept the sweet food prepared from within the cows. Bhūtāṃs;a has fulfilled the desires of thelearned.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The **Aśvinī** **sūkta** has been translated, though tough to explain, within a short compass, diṅmātrampradarśitam and deduction is left to the learned to interpret based on etymology, grammar, etc.
