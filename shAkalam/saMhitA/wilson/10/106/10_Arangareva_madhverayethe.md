## English translation:

“Like two loud-sounding (clouds), you send forth the sweet (**Soma**); like two bees (you deposit milk) in(the udder of) the cow which has its opening turned downwards; like two labourers you are dripping withperspiration, like a tired cow eating sweet herbage, you attend.”
