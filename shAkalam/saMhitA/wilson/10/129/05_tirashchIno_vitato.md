## English translation:

“Their ray was stretched out, whether across, or below, or above; (some) were shedders of seed,(others) were mighty; food was inferior; the eater was superior.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Their ray was stretched out: a reference to thesuddenness of creation, which was developed in the twinkling of an eye, like the flash of the sun's ray. It was soquick that it was doubtful whether the things in the central space (across) were created first, or those above orthose below; i.e., creation took plural ce simultaneously in all three portions of the universe. This was the order inwhich things were created, but the development of the world was like a flash of lightning, so that the series couldnot be distinguished (tatsṛṣṭvā tadevānuprāviṣat: **Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** 8.6). Thus the notion of a series,viz., from **ātmā** came the **ākāśa**, from the ākāśa the wind, from the wind fire etc., is reconciled: ātmanaākāśaḥ **sambhūta** ākāśādvāyurvāyoragniḥ: Taittirīya Āraṇyaka 8.1; whether across, or below, orabove: tiraścinaḥ = across, **tiryaksrotas**, that in which the stream of life is horizontal, i.e., the animal world;among the created objects some were living creatures, others were great, as the sky etc., the former being theenjoyers (bhoktāraḥ), the latter the things to be enjoyed (**bhojyaḥ**), so the creation was distinguished as thefood and the feeder
