## English translation:

“The non-existent was not, the existent was not; then the world was not, not the firmament, nor thatwhich is above (the firmament). How could there by any investing envelope, and where? Of what (could there be)felicity? How (could there be) the deep unfathomable water?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The non-existent: sat, asat: visible and invisibleexistence (asat śaśaviṣāṇavatrirupākhyam nāsīt: **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 7.1.5.1); matter and spirit, prakṛtiand **puruṣa**; the First Cause or **Brahmā** was in the beginning undeveloped in its effects, and existed beforeboth; investing envelope: each element as created or developed is invested by its rudiment; of what could therebe felicity: i.e., of whom or of what living being could enjoyment, or fruition, whether of pain or plural asure, bepredicated, there being no life?
