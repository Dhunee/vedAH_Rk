## English translation:

“Death was not nor at that period immortality, there was no indication of day, of night; That Oneunbreathed upon breathed of his own strength, other than That there was nothing else whatever.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Breathed:**svadhā** = **māyā**, or **prakṛti** (illusion or nature), the source of the world of phenomena;

Śa = breathed alongwith māyā
