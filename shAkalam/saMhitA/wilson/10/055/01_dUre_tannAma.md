## English translation:

“Your form held secret (by men) with averted faces, is far from here; when (heaven and earth) alarmed,called upon you for the sustenance (of the world), then you did fix in their proximity the heaven and earth,illumining, Maghavat, the sons, of (your) brother.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your brother: The brother of **Indra** is **Parjanya** (the rain); hissons are aggregations of water (udakasaṃstyāya)
