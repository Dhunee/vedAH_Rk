## English translation:

“Since you, Uṣas, did shine forth the first of luminaries, whereby you did beget the nourishment ofnourishment (the Sun); unequalled is the mighty greatness of you who are mighty, since your relationship isdownwards (towards us), though you are stationed on high.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uṣas: **Indra** is here intended in the form of thedawn, and then of the sun as typified by the dawn
