## English translation:

“I have brought to my presence the **Pitṛs** who are well cognizant (of my worship), the infallibility, andfood of the effused (**Soma**) with the sacrificial cake.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The infallibility...sacrifice: napātam, vikramaṇam = paths ofthe gods, whence there is no falling and where there is going and coming-- both as the consequence of sacrifice(**Yajus**. 29.56)
