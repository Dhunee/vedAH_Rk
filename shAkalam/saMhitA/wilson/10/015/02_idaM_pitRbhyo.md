## English translation:

“Let this our adoration be today addressed to those **Pitṛs** our predecessors, to those our successors,who have departed (to the world of the manes); to those who are seated in the terrestrial sphere, to those whoare present among opulent people.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Our successors: pūrvāsaḥ = elder brother, father, grandfather, and thelike, born before the birth of the worshipper; uparāsaḥ means younger brothers, sons, etc. ; or, those who havegone to **svarga**; uparāsaḥ, those who have ceased or rested, who have gone to the world of **brahmā** (Yajuṣ19.68); in the terrestrial sphere: pārthive **rajasi** = pṛthivīsambandhini rajo guṇakāryesmin karmaṇi, at thisritw which is connected with the earth is the effect of (or has for its effect) the quality of **rajas** (passion, or theactive principle);

Rajas = **jyotiṣ**, light-- terrestrial light or fire-- the phrase no doubt refers to the fire altar (Yajuṣ19.68)
