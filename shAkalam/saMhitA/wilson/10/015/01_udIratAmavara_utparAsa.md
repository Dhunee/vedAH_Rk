## English translation:

“Let the lower, the upper, the intermediate **Pitṛs**, rise up, accepting the **Soma** libation; may thoseprogenitors who, unlike wolves, acknowledging our offerings, have come to preserve our lives, protect us uponour invocations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pitṛs: three chief classes of the Pitṛs or manes are enumerated. RV 10.14.6 enumerated **aṅgirasas**, atharvasand **bhṛgus**; in **Manu**, the three classes are: agniśvāttas, **barhiṣads** and **saumyās**; Manu's enumerationoccurs in this **sūkta**; lower, upper and intermediate pitṛs: the degrees of merit arise first from the steadydischarge of duties enjoined by the **Vedas**; secondly, by performance of those enjoined by the law books; andfinally, when there has been some deficiency in some of the purificatory rites (**saṃskāras**);

Udiratam = let themobtain the best oblation; or, urdhvalokam gacchantu, let them go to the upper region (**Yajus**. 19.49);

Unlikewolves: avṛkāḥ = not wolves, i.e., not mischievous;

Ṛtajñaḥ = knowing truth; or, grateful for what has beendone in their honour; asum ya īyuḥ = who have gone to life, or breath, asmatprāṇam rakṣitum prāptaḥ; or,identical with air, having assumed the form of the air
