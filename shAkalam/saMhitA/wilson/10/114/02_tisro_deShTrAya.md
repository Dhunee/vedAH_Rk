## English translation:

“The three **Nirṛtis** do obeisance for the gist (of oblations), for (the gods), the far-famed sustainers (ofthe universe), know (their obeisance); the wise have ascertained the primary cause of these (divinities) who(exist) in the conspicuous (or) in the hidden observances.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three Nirṛtis: niṛṛti= the earth;

**Nirṛtiḥ** = the threeregions, earth, mid-air, and heaven, or the three deities (**Agni** etc.) presiding over those regions
