## English translation:

“(**Purūravā**). The arrow is not to be cast from the quiver for glory. I am no longer the impetuousdespoiler of the cattle (of the enemy), nor of their hundred-fold (riches). My prowess having lost its strength, (mymight) no longer flashes forth; (my warriors) the terrifiers (of the foe) hear not my shout in battle.”
