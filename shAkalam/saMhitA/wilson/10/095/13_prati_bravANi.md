## English translation:

“(**Ūrvaśī**). Let me reply. (Your son) will shed tears, crying out and calling aloud when the expectedauspicious time arrives; I will send you that (child) which is yours in me, depart to your house, you cannot,simpleton, detain me.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Auspicious time: adhye = adhyate vastūni, the expected thing; adhye śivayai: let meforbid him as he sheds tears (i.e., I will forbid him to shed tears); calling out he shall not weep for the fortunatesolicitude (of his father). **Purūravā** seems to urge as an argument for Ūrvaśī's return that the son expectedto be born (or, already born?) will long for his father, and, if separated from him, will weep, to which Ūrvaśīrepies that the son will not weep because she will send him to Purūravā; which is yours in me: i.e., which youhave plural ced in my womb
