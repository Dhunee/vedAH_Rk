## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Alegend: **mitra** and **Varuṇa**, excited by the charms of **Ūrvaśī**, gave birth to **Agastya**, pronouncing at the sametime an imprecation upon the nymph and condemning her to descend to earth and cohabit with a mortal. Iḷā, aking, had gone out hunting with the sons of **Manu**. He reached a mountain where Umā, the daughter of themountain, with her attendant nymphs, was worshipping **Śiva**. In punishment for his intrusion, he was changedinto a woman. He prayed to Śiva and was restored to manhood; he was referred to **Devī** who allowed him to bealternately **male** and feminine le, six months at a time. in the latter condition **Budha**, the son of **Soma**, becameenamoured of her, and had a son by her, who was called Purūravā who became the king of **Pratiṣṭhāna**.Purūravā became enamoured of Ūrvaśī, who became his mistress on condition that if he should be everaked in her sight, except in bed, she should return to heaven; he was also to take charge of two pet ramsbelonging to her. They lived together four years, when one night, hearing the bleating of the rams as they werebeing carried off by the gods, Purūravā sprang from the bed in pursuit, when a flash of lightning exhibited himto **Ūrvaśi** naked. She consequently left him and returned to heaven. Purūravā went in quest of her, andwandered aqbout like one distracted, until he finally discovered her sporting with fellow-nymphs. He implored herto return, but she refused, calling him by various opporbrious names, as horse, brute, and the like (**vajra**). Thisoccasions the dialogue of the **sūkta**, which contains an allusion to the past cohabitation of the king and thenymph and the unwillingness of the king to let his mistress depart. The legend is also related in the **drama**, theVikramorvas'I and in the **Ādi parva** of the **Mahābhārata**
