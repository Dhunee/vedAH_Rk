## English translation:

“Lord of bay steeds, drink at this ceremony of the **Soma** that has been shaken up with the water, fillyour belly with the libation offered by the priests, which the grinding-stones desired to express for you, **Indra**; doyou who are carried by hymns enhance your exhilaration with these (hymns).”
