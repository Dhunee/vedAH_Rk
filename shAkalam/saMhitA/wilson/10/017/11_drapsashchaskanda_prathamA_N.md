## English translation:

“The **Soma** has risen to the earthly and heavenly (worlds), both this visible world, and that which(existed) before (it); I offer that Soma flowing through the common region (of heaven and earth) after the sacrifice(offered by the) seven (officiating priests).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Drapsam = a name of the Sun (**Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa**: 8.4.1.20);
