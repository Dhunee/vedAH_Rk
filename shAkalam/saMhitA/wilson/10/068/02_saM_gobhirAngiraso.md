## English translation:

“The son of **Aṅgirasa** pervading him with his brightness has, like **Bhaga**, brought **Aryaman** to the cows;as **Mitra** (unites his radiance) with the people, so has he united husband and wife; **Bṛhaspati**, send (yourwide-spread rays to your worshippers) as (a warrior sends his) horses to battle.”
