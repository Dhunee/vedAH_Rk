## English translation:

“As the trees (bemoan) their leaves carried off by the winter, so **Vala** bemoaned his kine (carried off) byBṛhaspati; he did that which cannot be imitated, which cannot be repeated, whereby sun and moon mutually rise(day and night).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trees: vanāni = vananīyāni, the desirable wealth of cows; as leaves are carried off bywinter, so the desirable cows were carried off by Vala had pity on **Bṛhaspati** coming in search of the cows; i.e.,gave him the cows. He made this, i.e. the mutual rising of the sun and moon, which cannot be made afterwards,which cannot be made again
