## English translation:

“The earth was born from the upward-growing (tree), the quarters were born from the earth; Dakṣawas born from **Aditi**, and afterwards Aditi from **Dakṣa**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sāyṇa remarks: It may be objected that there is acontradiction here, since a self-produced effect cannot be the cause of itself. The venerable **Yāska** removingthis objection has questioned and refuted the inconsistency. He says (**Nirukta** 11.23), 'It may be objected, howcan it be that Dakṣa was born from Aditi and afterwards Aditi from Dakṣa? The answer is, either they were borntogether or by a divine law they reciprocally gave birth to each other and shared each other's nature' "
