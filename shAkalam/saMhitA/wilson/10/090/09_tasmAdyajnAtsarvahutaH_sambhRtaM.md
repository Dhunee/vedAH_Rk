## English translation:

“From that victim, in whom the universal oblation was offered, the ṛccas and **sāmans** were produced;from him the metres were born; from him the **yajus**. was born.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tasmād yajñāt = from that simple portionsurnamed the universal sacrifice, sarvahūtaḥ, meaning **Puruṣa** as the world;

**Yajña** = yajñasādhana, thematerial of sacrifice, i.e., the victim. Puruṣa is the spiritual cause and effect of material creation; it is from him,not from the ideal or real sacrifice, that all things originate
