## English translation:

“**Indra** advanced with vast (armies); he overcame with his might (his foed stationed between) heavenand earth; confident, he wielded his metal thunderbolt (to do) good to **Mitra**, **Varuṇa**, and the donor (of theoblation). when fierce he cut **Vṛtra** to pieces by his strength-- (Vṛtra who) obstructed the waters, and was encompassed bydarkness.”
