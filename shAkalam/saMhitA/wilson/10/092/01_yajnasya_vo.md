## English translation:

“You (gods, adore) the charioteer of the sacrifice, the lord of men, the invoker of the gods, the guest ofnight, the resplendent (**Agni**). Blazing amid the dry (bushes) preying upon the green, the showerer of desires, thebanner (of light), the adorable, he reposes in heaven.”
