“May the eternal (**Prajāpati**), the lord of wealth, of genitive rous mind, be willing to bestow (benefits onhim) to whom the divine **Savitā** has given birth; may **Bhaga** (induced) by (our) praises, and the divine Aryamanunfold (future rewards); or may some (other) gracious (divinity) be inclined to favour this (instrumental tutor of the rite).”
