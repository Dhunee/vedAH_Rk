## English translation:

“Not such (is their power); there is another greater than they; the creator, he sustains heaven andearth; possessed of might, he makes a pure skin, before his horses bear it to the sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Not such is their power:naitāvat, not so much; the race of gods is not possessed of so much power, namely, that of creating heavenand earth; the creator: **ukṣa** = liṭ, the bull, the sprinkler of seed, i.e., the creator of people, **hiraṇyagarbha**;extremely subtle, in the form of wind, consisting of the **liṅga** (i.e., the subtle body that accompanies the **soul** in itsmigration, not being destroyed at death, when the outer gross body is destroyed) entering the waters supportsheaven and earth; before his horses bear it to the sun: i.e., before creation; the creator took upon himself abodily form, before creating other forms
