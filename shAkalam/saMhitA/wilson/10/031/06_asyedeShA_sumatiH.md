## English translation:

“May this glorification, of this (assemly of the gods), ancient and frequent, approaching (the deities), bewidely diffused, (may the universal gods), collected together, bearing (future rewards, come) to the commonplace (of sacrifice) of this one who is mighty, which nourishes (them).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of this one who is mighty: i.e., of me whohas strength in the nature of progeny
