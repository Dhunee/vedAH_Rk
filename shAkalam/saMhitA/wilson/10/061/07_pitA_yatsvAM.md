## English translation:

“When the father united with the daughter, then associating with the earth, he sprinkled it with theeffusion; then the thoughtful gods begot **Brahma**; they fabricated the lord of the hearth (of sacrifice); the defenderof sacred rites.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Lord of the hearth of sacrifice: or **vāstoṣpati**. He is always considered to be **Rudra**, as in theAitareya **Brāhmaṇa** 3.33. The gods, incensed by Brahma's wickedness, seek for someone to put him to death;but, each feeling his own inability, they create Rudra for the purpose. Rudra wounds **Prajāpati**, who hadassumed the form of a deer, and flying to heaven becomes the asterism **mṛgaśīrṣa**, the doe into which thedaughter had been changed becomes the asterism **rohiṇī**. Rudra follows and becomes **mṛgavyādha**
