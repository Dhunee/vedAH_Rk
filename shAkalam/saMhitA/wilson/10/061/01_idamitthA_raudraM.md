## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A legend from **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 5.14: The brothers ofNābhānediṣṭha partioned among themselves to his exclusion the whole of the paternal wealth, while he wasengaged in his religious studies. Upon completing the studies, Nābhānediṣṭha applied to his father for hisportion, but there was nothing left, and his brothers refused to give any of their shares. As a compensation, Manurecommended to him to apply to the Aṅgirasas, who were engaged in a sacrifice for obtaining **Svarga**, buthaving come to the sixth day, were so perplexed by the number of the **mantras**, that they could go no furtherwithout assistance, Nābhānediṣṭha went to them, and repeated for them this and the following **sūkta**.Through the efficacy of these two **sūktas**, they went to heaven, leaving to him the remainder of the sacrifice, athousand head of cattle. As Nābhānediṣṭha was waking off with them, he was stopped by Rudra, seated on ablack corpse, who claimed whatever was left at a sacrifice as his right. Referring to **Manu**, the patriarch admittedthe law, and Nābhānediṣṭha relinquished the cattle to Rudra who, in reward of his ready acknowledgement ofthe truth, presented the cows to him
