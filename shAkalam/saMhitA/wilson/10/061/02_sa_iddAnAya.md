## English translation:

“He (**Rudra**) bestowing on his worshippers the gift (of wealth) and the defeat (of their foes),castingdown (the **rākṣasas**) with his weapons, has constructed the altar; rapid in movement, most fierce in speech,and shedding the procreative fluid like water around.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rapid in movement: itaūti = itogamanavat, going fromhere; a name of the **Aśvins**, he begat the Aśvins
