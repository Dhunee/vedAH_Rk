## English translation:

“This royal (**Soma**), this glorified creator, is praised (by all), and, like a sage, constituting his owncause-way, he traverses the firmament; he made **Kakṣīvat** tremble, he (made) **Agni** (shake) as horses (agitate)the light- whirling, revolving-wheel (of a chariot).”
