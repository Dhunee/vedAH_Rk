## English translation:

“He, like the showerer (**Indra**), cast foam around in the combat, and came away from us with a niggardmind; he advances not a step, relinquishing the donations; though skilled in rapine, he seizes not these my(cows).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The verse is said to be repeated by Nābhānediṣṭha when he sees **Vāstoṣpati** (or **Rudra**) coming tostop him; cast foam around: an allusion to the destruction of **Namuci** by Indra in the shape of the foam of the sea;relinquishing the donations: i.e., the cows given to Rudra by the **Aṅgirasas** as **dakṣiṇā** or honorarium
