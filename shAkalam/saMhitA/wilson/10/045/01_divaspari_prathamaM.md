Agni was first borṅi.e., Agni represents successively the sun, fire, lightning. (**Yajus**. 12.18-29: Agni was first genitive rated as **Prāṇa**,or vital air, from the breath of heaven, and that man genitive rated him; secondly, that **Prajāpati** (nṛmaṇaḥ) createdhim eternal in all the waters, and that the **yajamāna** lighting him also gives birth to him)
