## English translation:

“You came, **Aśvins**, to the rescue of **Bhujyu**, you came to the rescue of **Vaśa**, you came to Śiñjārato (hear) his desirable (praise); the offerer of oblations besieges your friendship; and I desire happiness throughyour protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śiñjāra: cf. RV 8.5.25; Śiñjāra was an **Atri**; Aśvins came to rescue him from a fire-pit
