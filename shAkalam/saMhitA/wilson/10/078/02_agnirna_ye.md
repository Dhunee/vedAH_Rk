“(You) who like **Agni** (are endowed) with splendour, who have golden ornaments upon your breasts,who like the winds (are) self-yoked, swift-moving, who like the extremely wise (are) venerable and able guides,and like the **Soma** the giver of delight, (do you com) to the (worshipper) going to the sacrifice.”
