## English translation:

“Mātalin prospers with the **Kavyas**; **Yama** with the **Aṅgirasas**; **Bṛhaspati** with the Ṛkvans; they whomthe gods augment, and they who augment the gods, these rejoice in **Svāhā**, those in the **Svadhā**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

MātaliṅMātalī is the name of the charioteer of **Indra**; so Mātalin (having **Mātalī**) is a name of Indra
