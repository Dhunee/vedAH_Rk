## English translation:

“Sage **Manyu**, taking no part in the worship of you, the powerful one, I have retreated (from before myfoes); worshipping not, I was angry with you; (yet) being (incorporated with) my body, approach me to give mestrength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Taking no part in the worship: liṭ, being without a share in your acts (kṛtvā), i.e., not sacrificing to youat the sacrifice, and therefore being deprived of your favour\]. Manyu, bearer of the thunderbolt, come up to me, let us slay the **Dasyus**, think upon you kinsman.
