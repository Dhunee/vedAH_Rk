## English translation:

“Armed with the bright lightning he goes to the (scene of) adoration; endowed with might he has seatedhimself on the spacious plural ce (of sacrifice); he (is) triumphant with his companions (the **Maruts**); the wiles of hisseventh brother do not (prevail) at the rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His seventh brother: bhrātuḥ = one who has to share in distribution;

Seventh: the seventh of the **Ādityas**, **Dhātā** etc.; perhaps the rākṣasā **heti** is meant
