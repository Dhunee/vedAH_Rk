## English translation:

“Going to the battle, marching with easy gait, desiring the spoil, he set himself to the acquisition of all(wealth). Invincible, destroying the phallus-worshippers, he won by his prowess whatever wealth (was concealedin the city) with the hundred gates.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Phallus-worshippers: śiśnadevān is a **tatpuruṣa** compound; hence, themeaning would perhaps be: incontinent or licentious
