## English translation:

“(The **Maruts**), plural ased with our praise like water-drops sent down by clouds, shower wealth; they arethe genitive rators (of the world) like sacrifices abounding with oblations; I have not praised the mighty band ofMaruts (adequately) for their honour or of their glory.”
