## English translation:

“The destructive (**Maruts**) made ornaments for their decoration many hostile hosts cannot overcomethe band of Maruts; the moving sons of heaven do not issue forth, the swift-going sons of **Aditi** do not increase (inglory).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Destructive: or, human; the Maruts were at first men, but through their good works obtained immortality;do not increase in glory: because, they are not praised by us
