## English translation:

“You (move along) like horses harnessed to the chariot-poles with reins; at break of day you (areendowed) with radiance like the luminaries (of heaven); you are like hawks, like the destroyers of foes, desirousof renown; you cover the ground like travellers, you move everywhere.”
