## English translation:

“I offer graceful praise with all my heart to **Agni**, the drinker of water, whose back is sprinkled withSoma, the ordainer (of the rite), to whom vigorous horses and bulls and barren cows and sheep are consignedas burnt offerings.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I offer: **Yajus**. 20.78 has janaya, offer, perhaps addressed to the **Adhvaryu**
