## English translation:

“**Indra**, the protector of the virtuous, crushed the arrogant (foe), attaining vast strenth; shouting, he cutoff the three heads of the multiform son of **Tvaṣṭā** (the lord) of cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shouting: śabdam kurvan; gonāmacakrāṇaḥ, appropriating the cattle
