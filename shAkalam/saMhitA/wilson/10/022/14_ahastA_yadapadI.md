## English translation:

“When the earth which has neither **hands** nor feet flourished throught the acts of (devotion paid to) theadorable (deities), then you did smite down **Śuṣṇa**, circumambulating it on the right, for the sake of **Viśvāyu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For the sake of viśvāyu: going everywhere unimpeded; name of a king **Aurvaśeya**, descendant of **Ūrvaśī**
