## English translation:

“We call upon the spirit (of **Subandhu**) with the **Soma** appropriated to the progenitors, with the praisesepithet of the Soma. **Yajus**. 3.53 reads stomena: praise is of to kinds, that of gods and men, the latter isnārāśamsaḥ, whence the epithet narāśaṃsa means, suited to man; that is, to deified men or **pitṛs**\].”
