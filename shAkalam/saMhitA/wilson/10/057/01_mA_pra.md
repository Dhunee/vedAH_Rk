## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A legend explains the origin of the **sūkta**: there were fourbrothers, **purohitas** of the **rājā** Asamāti: **Bandhu**, **Subandhu**, Śrutabandhu and Viprabandhu. The king havingdismissed them, appointed to others, Māgavins (magicians), at which the brothers being offended, instrumental tutedmagic ceremonies for the rājā's destruction; hearing of this, the Māgavins put Subandhu to death; on whichthe other three composed this sūkta for their own safety. The offerer of the libation: i.e., king Asamāti; or,taking sominaḥ as nominative plural, may we the offerers of the **Soma** not depart from the sacrifice
