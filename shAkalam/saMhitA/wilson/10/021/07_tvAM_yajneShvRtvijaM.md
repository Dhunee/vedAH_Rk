## English translation:

“**Agni**, you, the mighty one, are known far and wide by your radiant lustre; bellowing, you rush like abull, you impregnate the sister (plural nts) in your exhilaration; you are mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vivakṣase = **mahān** bhavasi; vi vomade = in your; or, for your exhilaration, i.e., for the sake of the various kinds of exhilaration produced by drinkingthe **Soma**;

Vaḥ = Agni; or, **viśvedevāḥ**; or, connected with vivakṣase as cause and effect, as made sañjatesati yasmād evam kṛtavān asi tasmāt tvam mahān bhavasi, the inebriation produced, i.e., since you havethus acted, you are great; The words vi vo made, seems like a quote or Soma-drinking refrain; perhaps also aplay upon the name Viimada
