## English translation:

“The establishers (of the rite) worship you with their ladles (filled with the oblation), like (earth)sprinkling (showers); you sustain exceedingly black forms and white and all beauties for your exhilaration; youare mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like earth-sprinkling showers: i.e., showers worship **Agni** as their **pitṛ**; or, your rays dwell with youlike oblations spinkled with the ladles; for your exhilaration: vaḥ = **viśvedevāḥ**
