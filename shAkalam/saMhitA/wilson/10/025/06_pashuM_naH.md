## English translation:

“You protect our cattle, **Soma**, and the variously occupied world, contemplating all existing beings; youprepare (the world) for them to live in for your exhilaration; for you are mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For the exhilaration: vaḥ = all thegods; **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 3.2.9.7: both gods and men are dependent on gifts of Soma
