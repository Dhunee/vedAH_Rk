## English translation:

“What (other god but me) whose eyeless daughter is ever present knows her and honours (her) theblind one; which of the two (deities) lets loose that bolt against (a foe)-- he who assails, (or) he who protects hiṃ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

What other god but me: This is referred to **Indra**, whose eyeless daughter is **Prakṛti**, crude matter or nature,born of Indra as the creator, and at the **mahāpralaya** (final dissolution of the world) merging into him only;eyeless daughter: he whose daughter was once eyeless, who, knowing this, will despise her for being blind?
