## English translation:

“Beholding here the drinkers of the libations who serve not **Indra**, who cut (the worshippers) to pieceswith their **hands**, assailing them to do them harm; my shafts quickly fall upon them, as well as on those who revile(your) powerful friend. all existence; the ancient Indra verily destroys (his foe), the other does not destroy (Indra). The united two(heaven and earth) surpass not him who extends beyond the confines of the universe.”
