## English translation:

“At the creation of the gods, the (clouds) stood first; from their division, the waters (of the rain) cameforth; the three divinities (**Parjanya**, **Vāyu** and **Āditya**). Sowing in succession, warm the earth; two of them(Vāyu and Āditya) convey all-delighting water (to the sun's sphere).”
