## English translation:

“(**Indra** speaks). You know that what is said by me at this time is the truth, that I may create both bipedsand quadrupeds. I distribute without conflict (among my worshippers) the wealth (that I have taken from him), who(neglecting me), the showerer of desires), wishes to contend with women.”
