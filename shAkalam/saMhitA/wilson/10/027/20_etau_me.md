## English translation:

“Turn not back, but repeatedly praise these two yoked (steeds) of me the destroyer, which advance (tothe foe and to the sacrifice); the waters fulfil **Indra**'s purpose and (so does) the all-cleansing sun, being (swift as)a cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Which advance to... sacrifice: gāvau;

Yuktau = well worshipped; the waterṣ..cloud: I have beheld Indraas **Prajāpati**, driving the crowd from afar and approaching with his army, self-moving, without chariots
