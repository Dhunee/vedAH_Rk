## English translation:

“They (the **Aṅgirasas**) go in all directions calling (upon **Prajāpati**), half of them cook (their oblations),the other half cook not; this divine **Savitā** has told me this-- (**Agni**), whose food is wood and ghī, serves(Prajāpati by means of oblations).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Savitr**. = the stimulator of all, i.e., **Āditya** or Prajāpati
