## English translation:

“If I encounter in combat the undevout, resplendent in their bodies, then will I cook a vigorous bull forthem, and will sprinkle (upon the fire) the exhilarating **Soma** the fifteen-fold (Soma).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soma is called fifteen-foldbecause it grows during the light half of the month stalk by stalk on the fifteen days, beginning with **pratipat** (thefirst day), and similarly die off during the dark half of the **moth**; or, because the Soma offered at noonday isaccompanied by the **Trivṛt** and **pañcadaśa** **Stomas**
