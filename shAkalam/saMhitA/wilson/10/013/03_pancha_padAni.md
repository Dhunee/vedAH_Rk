## English translation:

“I make the five stages of the sacrifice ascend; I take four steps by pious observances; with the sacredsyllable, I perfect this (adoration); I purify (the **Soma**) on the navel of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I make...ascend: the fivestages are the five members of the sacrifice: i.e., grain, Soma, the kind, the **puroḍāśa** cake and butter. Thefour steps are: the metres most commonly used, **triṣṭubh** etc.; the other three are perhaps, **jagatī**, gāyatrīand **anuṣṭubh**; pious observances: **rupaḥ** = that which causes the sacrificers to ascend to heaven, i.e., thesacrifice, I make ascend = I put on the **sakaṭa**
