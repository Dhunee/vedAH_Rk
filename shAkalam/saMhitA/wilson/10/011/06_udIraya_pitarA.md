## English translation:

“Wake up the parents, as the Sun his splendour; (the worshipper) desires to offer worship to (thedeities) who are plural ased by it; with all his heart he wishes (to do so); he desires to repeat (your praise); thebearer (of the oblation) is anxious to effect the good work; the sacrifice longs for augmentation, the prudent(sacrificer) trembles in his thoughts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The parents: heaven and earth, the parents of all living creatures; as thesun his splendour: **jāraḥ** = the sun,bhagam bhajanīyam **jyotiṣ**; the prudent trembles in his thoughts: **asuraḥ** =prāṇavān, breathing; or, prajñāvān, intelligent;

Vepate = trembles, fearing lest the ceremony be defective
