## English translation:

“When, adorable **Agni**, this united praise is resplendent among the adorable gods, and when you,bearer of the oblatio, apportion the precious (treasures), then allot to us a valuable share. bring to us the heaven and earth, the daughters of the divine (**Prajāpati**), let none of the gods be absent, and doyou yourself be present.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The daughters of the divine: devaputre = **devasya** prajāpater duhitārau; or, they whohave the gods for progeny
