## English translation:

“I glorify him who is of wonderful radiance like the sun, the desirable, the giver of happiness, the guest(of man), the benevolent. He bestows vigour (upon the worshippers); **Agni**, the remover of sorrow, the sustaineerof all, the invoker (of the gods), the lord of the mansion.”
