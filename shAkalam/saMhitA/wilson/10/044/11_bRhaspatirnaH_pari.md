## English translation:

“May **Bṛhaspati** defend us from a malignant (foe) coming from behind, from above, or from below; mayIndra defend us from foes in front and in the middle; may he, our friend, bestow wealth upon (us) his friends.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thelast two ṛcas are a refrain from the previous two **sūktas**, verbatim repetitions
