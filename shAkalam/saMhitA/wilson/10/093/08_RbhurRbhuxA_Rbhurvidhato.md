## English translation:

“The mighty (**Indra**) is resplendent (through the sacrifice), the joy of the worshipper is resplendent;vigorous are the two horses of you rapidly approaching, whose hymn is unassailable (by the **rākṣasas**); (this)sacrifice is apart, not human.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e., it is from heaven
