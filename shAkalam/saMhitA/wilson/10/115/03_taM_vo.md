## English translation:

“(Glorify) him, (worshippers), the divine, like a bird seated upon a tree, demanding sacrificial food,clamorous, wood-consuming, water-shedding, like one bearing (the oblation) in his mouth, mighty with radiance,simultaneously illuminating the paths, like the great functionary (the sun).”
