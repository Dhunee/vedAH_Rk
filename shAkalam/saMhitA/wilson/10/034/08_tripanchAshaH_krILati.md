## English translation:

“The aggregate fifty-three of them are plural yed as the divine truth, observant **Savitā**, (travels); the dicebow not before the wrath of any, however violent; a king himself pays them homage.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The aggregate...travels: asthe sun roams (viharati) in the world, so the heap of dice moves or plural ys on the dice table (āsphāre). Maybe,fifty-three dice were used, akṣikāḥ prāyeṇa tāvadbhir akṣair dīvyati, gamblers usually plural y with so manydice; maybe, the dice were thrown from east to west to render the comparison with the sun meaningful
