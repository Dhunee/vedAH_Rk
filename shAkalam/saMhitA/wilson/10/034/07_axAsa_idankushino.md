## English translation:

“Dice verily are armed with hooks, with goads, pricking, paining and torturing (the gamester); to thewinning (plural yer) they are the givers of sons, they are tipped with honey; slaying him in return by taking away thegambler's (all).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They are the givers of sons: by acquiring wealth through their means a family may be reared; bytaking the gambler's all: barhaṇa = parivṛddheṇa sarvasvaharaṇena
