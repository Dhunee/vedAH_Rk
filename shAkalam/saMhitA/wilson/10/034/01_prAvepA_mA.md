## English translation:

“The large rattling dice exhilarate me as torrents borne on a precipice flowing in a desert; the excitingdice animate me as the taste of the **Soma** of Maujavat (delights the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Flowing in a desert: iriṇevarvṛtānaḥ: a reference to the dice; rolling on the dice-board; exciting dice: **vibhītaka**, the seed of themyrobalan, used as a die;

Maujavat: a mountain, where is said the best Soma is found
