## English translation:

“When, **Vasu**, (will our) praise (reach) you desiring it? (when) will he, (like) a dam, obstruct and letloose the long-protracted for the sake of wind- driven (rain)?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Although the worship of **Indra** may be impeded bydelay, as water is checked by an embankment (śamaśā = **kulyā**), yet it will take effect ultimately, and thewater or the rain will spread abroad; cf. **Nirukta** 5.12
