## English translation:

“The yellow-bearded, yellow-haired, iron-hearted **Indra**, the drinker of the yellow (**Soma**), who has beeninvigorated by the Soma which has to be quickly quaffed, who is rich in sacrificial food through his swift bayhorses, may he drive his two bay horses safe through all difficulties.”

Through all difficulties: asmākamduritāni: i.e., our sins
