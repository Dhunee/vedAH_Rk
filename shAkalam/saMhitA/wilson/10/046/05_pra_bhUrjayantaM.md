## English translation:

“Be competent, (priest, to glorify) the victorious mighty **Agni**, the sustainer of the wise, (even) fools(adore) him, the exempt from folly, the demolisher of cities; conducting the embryo of touchwood, (Agni). Like agolden- haired, swift-moving (horse), loving praise and wealth, they bring him to the sacrifice.”
