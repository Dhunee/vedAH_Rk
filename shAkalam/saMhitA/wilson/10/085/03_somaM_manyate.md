## English translation:

“He who has drunk thinks that the herb which men crush is the **Soma**; (but) that which theBrāhmaṇas know to be Soma,, of that no one partakes. {i.e., no one partakes of it unless he has sacrificed; ifthe Soma be taken as the moon, 'no one' will mean 'no one but the gods'\].”
