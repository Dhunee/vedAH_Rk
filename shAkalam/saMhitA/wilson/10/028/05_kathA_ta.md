## English translation:

“How, **Indra**, should I yet immature (in understanding), be capable of comprehending this (your power,so as to render fitting) praise to those who are wise and powerful? Therefore, do you who are all-knowinginstruct us in fit season; the portion of your (praise) O **Maghavan**, which (we offer) is a burden easy to be bornṣ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Instrumental uct us: Since we cannot perform even a portion of your power without an effort on account of our slownessof mind, do you again tel us your power and the way to praise you
