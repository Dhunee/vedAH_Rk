## English translation:

“(Vasukra speaks). The hare graps the assailing beast of prey; with a clod of clay I cleave the distant(mountain); I can compel the great to submit to the small; swelling (with courage) the calf attacks the bulḷ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kṣuram= a long hard, sharp claw, like a razor, belonging to lion, tiger, etc., i.e., a strong fierce wild beast. If kṣuramimplies, a razor as in RV 8.4.16, the use of metal for tool-making is apparent
