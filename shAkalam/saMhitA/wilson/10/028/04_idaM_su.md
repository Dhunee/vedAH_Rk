## English translation:

“Overcomer of foes, (**Indra**) be cognizant of this my (power, whereby) rivers bear their waterbackwards, and the eater of cut (grass) confronts the lion, the jackal drives the wild boar from his lair.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Foes: Oworshipper, Vasukra: Indra being the speaker;

Alternative: Vasukra speaks claiming superhuman power as theson of Indra; eater of cut grass: i.e., the deer; or, is it the fox, jackal, from īlup, īrup, to carry off (rob)? jackaldrives: I have the power to alter the ordinary course of nature.
