## English translation:

“The many waters occupy a common station, clamouring around like the assembled mothers of the calf;wandering above the summit of the water they utter the praises of the sweet-flavoured ambrosia.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dark allusionsrefer to the agency of the thunder-clouds in sending rain; the calf, **vatsa** = vaidyutāgni, **agni** as the lightning
