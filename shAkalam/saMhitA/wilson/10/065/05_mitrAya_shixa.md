## English translation:

“Worship the liberal **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, the two royal deities who are never negligent in their thoughts,whose vast body is resplendent through their functions, upon whom the two solicitous worlds (heaven and earth)remain (dependent).”

Their functions: of illuminating the world; two solicitous worlds: nādhasi = solicitous; or,abounding in gods and men
