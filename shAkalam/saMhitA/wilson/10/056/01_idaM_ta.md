## English translation:

“This (light) is one (portion) of you, and this other is one (portion); with your third light enter into (outerradiance); on the entrance of the body into (the sun), the supreme birthplace of the gods, become lovely andbeloved.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This light is one: liṭ, this (is) one of you, the other (is) one; with the third light enter; **jyotis**. is **Agni**, firehis deceased son **Vājin**, and the purport is to enjoin the reunion of the vital with the external elements, vitalwarmth with fire, vital breath with air, the **soul** animating the body with that animating the sun. The sun is the soulof the animate and inanimate world; sun is the supreme birthplace of the gods; entrance of the body: i.e., into thatsun; perhaps the vedantic notion of bodily existence after death by means of the **sūkṣmaśarīra** (the subtlebody)
