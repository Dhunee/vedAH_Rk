## English translation:

“You make swift all those sacrifices which, son of strength, you yourself support; may your protectionbe granted for the repulse (of enemies, may) wealth (be granted) for our support; the sacrifice, the hymn, thesacred text, the voice (is) raised (to you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The voice is raised to you: udyatam **vacas**: two things are included inthis phrase: **mantra**, which is the means of enunciating the sacrifice; and the **brahma** = parivṛḍham śastram, theprayer that is not recited aloud
