## English translation:

“That, **Bṛhaspati**, is the best (part) of speech which those giving a name (to objects) first utter; thatwhich was the best of those (words) and free from defect, (**Sarasvatī**) reveals it though secretly imparted, bymeans of affection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Deity **Jñāna**: The knowledge of **Brahman** is identical with the study of the **Veda**, essentialto divine knowledge; Those...first utter: this refers to children's first utterances; Bṛhaspati says this to himselfwith a smile, having noticed that children know the meaning of the Veda: **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.14; Best ofthose words: tat = that knowledge of the Veda
