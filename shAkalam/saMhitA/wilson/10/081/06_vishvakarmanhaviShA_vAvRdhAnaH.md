## English translation:

“**VIśvakarman**, magnified by the oblation, do you of yourself worship earth and heaven; let other men(who offer no oblations) be everywhere confounded; may he, rich in oblations, be the granter of heaven at thisour (sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Magnified by oblation: or, by me, Viśvakarman, becoming an oblation. In the previous ṛca.,haviṣā = at the oblation = when I am made an oblation; cf. **Nirukta** 10.27; **Yajus**. 17.22;

**Sūriḥ** = prajñāta,knowing; or, may **Indra** be our adviser
