## English translation:

“Grant to your friends, **Viśvakarman**, at the oblation, your best, your worst and your intermediate forms,and to these do you yourself, possessor of the oblation, becoming augmented in person n (by oblations), offerworship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your beṣṭ..forms: The best forms are the bodies of the gods, etc.; the intermediate forms are thebodies of men, etc.; the inferior forms are the bodies of worms, etc. Viśvakarman, the creator is mixed up withViśvakarman, as **Tvaṣṭā** or **Agni**. It means that man is incompetent to worship the creator, that is, in his forms,and it must be done by himself
