## English translation:

“What was the station? What was the material? How was (it done)? So that the beholder of all,**Viśvakarman** (was) genitive rating and disclosed heaven by his might.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the first ṛca, it is said that after thepraḷaya, the creator made all things anew. In this ṛca, it is now asked: where was the scene of action, what werethe materials, and how was thw work performed? In this world, a potter must have his shop, his clay, his wheel;so what does **Iśvara** have for site, matter and implements? The answer is negative. Iśvara does not needanything of this kjind. tatsṛṣṭvā tadevānuprāviśat: **Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** 8.6
