## English translation:

“For you, brilliant through your functions, have sat down; now mount, (each of you, his) chariot, whichrests on the yoke, which abides in the forests, (to overcome) those (people) who clamour against us; Nṛmedhawas preserved (by you) from sin, the pious worshipper was preserved from sin.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Which abides in the forests: or,in the water; **Varuṇa** is said to reside in the ocean
