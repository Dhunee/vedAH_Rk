## English translation:

“This iniquity (found) in this Śakapūta, when **Mitra** is propitious, destroys opposing heroes, when thei.e., Mitra or **Varuṇa**; avaḥ = food; when the approaching Mitra (or Varuṇa) gives protection to the sacrificial ritesand bodies of the worshipper who delights him with oblations\].”
