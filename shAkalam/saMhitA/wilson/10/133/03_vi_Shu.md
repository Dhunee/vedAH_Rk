## English translation:

“May all our assailants, who make no offerings, quickly perish, may our praises (be successful); you,**Indra**, hurl the weapon at the foe who seeks to slay us, may that liberal (**hand**) of yours be the giver of wealth (tous); may the bowstrings on the bows of our enemies be destroyed.”
