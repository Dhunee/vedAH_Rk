## English translation:

“**Vāyu** churned for him, the inflexible (thunder) ground it when the radiant (Sun), along with **Rudra**,drank the water with his cup.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With his cup: the cup is the sun's rays, which absorb the moisture of the earth; theagitation of the wind sends this moisture down again as rain; kunan namā = that which often guides but cannotbe guided, i.e., the **mādhyamikā** vāk;

Rudra = the lightning, vaidyutāgni
