## English translation:

“**Maruts**, secure to us well-being on roads, in deserts, well-being in waters, midst the might of assailinghosts; well-being in the son-bearing wombs (of our wives); well-being for (the acquisition of) riches.”

On roas: indistricts fit for travelling, i.e., well-watered, as opposed to dhanvasu
