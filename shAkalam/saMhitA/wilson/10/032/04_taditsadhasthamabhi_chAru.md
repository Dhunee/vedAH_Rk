## English translation:

“Shine, **Indra**, upon this elegant chamber of sacrifice when our praises desire (your approach) as kine(desire) their stalls; since the praise of (me) the worshipper precedes (the adoration) of the company, and thisperson accompanied by the seven officiating priests is the offerer of praise.”
