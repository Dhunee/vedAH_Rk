## English translation:

“**Agni**, the destroyer (of the **rākṣasas**), who have two (rows of teeth), sharpening them both, applythem to (the rākṣasas, and preserve) both the upper and the lower (world); and march, radiant (Agni, againstthe rākṣasas) in the firmament, seize the **yātudhānas** with your jaws.”
