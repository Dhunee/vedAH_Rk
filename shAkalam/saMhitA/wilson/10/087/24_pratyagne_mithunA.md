## English translation:

“Consume, **Agni**, these pairs of **Yātudhānas** and Kimīdins; I whet you, O sage, the invincible one,with my praises; wake up.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kimīdins: a kind of **rākṣasas**; **Nirukta** 6.11: those who wander about saying kimidānīm, what now? or kim idam, what is this?
