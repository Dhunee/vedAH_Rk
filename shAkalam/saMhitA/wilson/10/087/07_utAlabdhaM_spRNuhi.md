## English translation:

“And defend me, **Jātavedas**, with your darts when I am seized, (defend me) from the Yātudhānaswho has seized me; anticipating him, do you, **Agni**, blazing fiercely, slay him; may the swift-flying vultures, theflesh-eaters, devour him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Swift-flying vultures: kṣviṅkāḥ = noisy; or, a kind of bird
