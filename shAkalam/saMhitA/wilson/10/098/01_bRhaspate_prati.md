## English translation:

“: Go, **Bṛhaspati**, on my behalf to the gods, whether you are **Mitra**, or **Varuṇa**, or **Pūṣan**, orassociated with the **Ādityas**, the **Vasus**, or the **Maruts**-- do you cause **Parjanya** to send down rain for **Śantanu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend from **Nirukta** 2.10: **Devāpi** and Śantanu were sons of Ṛṣṭiṣeṇa of the **Kuru** family; the youngerŚantanu became king, Devāpi chose a life of penance. In Śantanu's kingdom there was no rain for twelveyears-- the consequence of Śantanu having improperly assumed the government while his elder brother, themore legitimate **rājā**, was living. Śantanu desired to resign his authority, but Devāpi declined to accept thethrone, saying, "Let me be your **Purohita** and conduct your religious rites". The story is in **Viṣṇu** Purāṇa4.20.7; **Ādi parva**, **Mahābhārata**; **Bhāgavata Purāṇa** 9.22.14-17
