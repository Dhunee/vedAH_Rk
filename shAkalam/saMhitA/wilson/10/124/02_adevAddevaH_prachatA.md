## English translation:

“(**Agni** speaks). From being no divinity I issue a divninty from the cave at the solicitation (of the gods),and being manifest I attain immortality; when being inauspicious I abandon the sacrifice as it becomesauspicious, through my (old) friendship I come to the binding touch-wood.”

Being inauspicious: i.e., not beingbeautiful, not being radiant; binding touchwood: nābhim: from ṇaḥ, nahana śīlām **bandhana** śīlām; or, afamily of strangers
