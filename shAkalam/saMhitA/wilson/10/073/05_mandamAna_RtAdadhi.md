## English translation:

“**Indra** rejoicing at the sacrifice accompanied by hisswift-moving riends (the **Maruts**, gave) wealth to thepeople; he has come with them against the **Dasyu** to destroy his illusions; he has scattered the dark rain-cloudsand the gloom.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dark rain-clouds: tamrāḥ = causing to languish, i.e., by giving no rain; is this a plural y on the wordtāmra, copper?
