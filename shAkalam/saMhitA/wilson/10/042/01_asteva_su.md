## English translation:

“Direct your laudation to him, (**Indra**), like an archer aiming a larger arrow (to its mark), like a decorator(applying his ornaments); surpass by your praises, sages, the praises of your adversaries; delight Indraworshipper, by the (offering of the) **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A larger arrow: lāyam = adhering, from li, i.e., heart-poiercing arrow
