## English translation:

“He who has but one foot takes a longer time on a journey than he who has two; he who has two feetcomes after him who has three; he who has four feet comes up overtaking the two-footed (and three-footed),beholding their traces as he passes by.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Foot: a metaphor, for portion or wealth. The man who has four times theriches of another should be four times as liberal
