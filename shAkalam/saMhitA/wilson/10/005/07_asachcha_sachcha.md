“Non-existent, and existent (is **Agni**) in the supreme heaven, in the birth-plural ce of **Dakṣa**, and in thepresence of **Aditi**; Agni is elder born to us (who enjoy the fruit) of the sacrifice; in the olden time he was the bulland the cow.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Non-existent and existent: asacca sacca, both unevolved and evolved, identifying Agni with the firstcause and first effect, with a reference to such texts as asad eva idam **agra** āsit (Chāndogya Upaniṣad3.19.1), the non-existent (or unevolved) was verily before this (Creation); in the birth-plural ce of Dakṣa: dakṣasyajanman, in the birth of Dakṣa, i.e., **Prajāpati**, the creator; Dakṣa may be the sun: he divided himself into three,one-third was the wind: **Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa** 10.6.5.3;

Aditi = the earth; he was the bull and the cow: he isboth **male** and feminine le; Agni is identified with all things
