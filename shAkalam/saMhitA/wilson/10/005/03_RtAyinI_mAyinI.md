## English translation:

“The two observers of truth, the two possessors of wisdom, (heaven and earth) sustain (this **Agni**);measuring the time, they have brought forth and reared a son; and (men), pondering in their minds on that navelof the universe, movable and immovable, the thread of the sage (Agni, are blessed with happiness).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The threadof the sage: kaveścit tantum = agneḥ tanitāram vaiśvānarākhyam aṃśam, the thread or connector of Agni--the portion called **vaiśvānara**
