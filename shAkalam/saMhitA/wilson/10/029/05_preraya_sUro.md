## English translation:

“As the sun (brings) the ascetic, do you bring to the end (of existence) (your worshippers), who satisfyyour desire (fo the **Soma**), as husbands (the desire of their wives); and who (being) leaders of rites, multiformIndra, offer to you ancient praises with (sacrificial) viands.”
