## English translation:

“As (the bird) who deposits its young (in its nest) in the tree (is) eagerly looking around, so you bearers(**Aśvins**) your pure praise (ever) keeps you awake; (that praise) of which **Indra** has for many days been theinvoker, (Indra) the friend of man, the manliest of men, (to whom the **Soma**) is offered at night.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Sāyaṇa** adds:"Thus, he (?some older commentator) explains, treating this verse as one composed in praise of the Aśvins, thisis wrong, for the hymn being in praise of Indra, this first verse too is in praise of Indra." **Nirukta** 6.8:jigartigrāhvātikarmā
