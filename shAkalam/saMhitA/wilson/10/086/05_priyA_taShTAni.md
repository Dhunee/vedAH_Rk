## English translation:

“The ape has spoiled the beloved ghī-adorned (oblations) made to me (by worshippers); let mequickly cut off his head, let me not be the giver of happiness to one who works evil; **Indra** is above all (the world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ape: **kapi** = ape; also, a shorter form of **Vṛṣākapi**
