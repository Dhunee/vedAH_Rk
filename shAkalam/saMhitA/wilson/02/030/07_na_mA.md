## English translation:

“Let not **Indra** vexme, or weary me, or make me slothful; never may we say (to another), do not offer the **Soma**; (for it is Indra) who will fulfil (my wishes), who will give (me riches), who will hear (my prayers), who will reward me, presenting libations, with cattle.”
