## English translation:

“The waters cease not (to flow in libations) to the divine **Indra**, the sender of rain, the animator (of all), the slayer of Ahi; day by day proceeds the current of the waters; at what period of time was their first creation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The animator of all: savitre = to the sun, as one with Indra; this may also be rendered as sarvasya prerakāya, to the instrumental gator, impeller, or animator of all; at what period of time: **nityā** eva hi tā ityarthaḥ, the drift of the question is the non-creation or eternity of the waters
