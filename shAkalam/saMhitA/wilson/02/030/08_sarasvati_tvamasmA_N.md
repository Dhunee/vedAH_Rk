## English translation:

“**Sarasvatī**, do you protect us; associated with the **Maruts** and firm (of purpose), overcome our foes, whiilst **Indra** slays the chief of the Śaṇḍikas, defying him and confiding in his strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śaṇḍikas : vṛṣaqbham śaṇḍikānām, descendants of **śaṇḍa**, who, with **Amarka**, is the **purohita**, or priest of the **asuras** \[śaṇḍāmarkāvasurapurohitau (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā**: 6.4.10.1)
