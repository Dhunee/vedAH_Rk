## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Soma**, eradicate the worker (of evil), whom you hate; be the encouragers of the liberal instrumental tutor of the rite; protect us in this plural ce of peril, and make the world (free from fear).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Make the world free from fear: kṛṇutam u lokam = liṭ, make the world; the verb is not used in the sense of creating; to specify what is done, added: bhayarahitam = freed from fear
