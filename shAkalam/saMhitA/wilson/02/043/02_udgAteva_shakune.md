## English translation:

“You sing, Bird, like the **udgatā** chanting the **sāma**; you murmur like the brahmaputra at sacrifices; like a horse (neighing) when approaching a mare do you proclaim (aloud) to us good fortune from every quarter; proclaim aloud prosperity to us from every direction.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Brahmaputra: the same as the brāhmaṇāccaṃsi one of the sixteen priests, who 'sastram śaṃsati, recites the **mantra** that is not to be sun or chanted
