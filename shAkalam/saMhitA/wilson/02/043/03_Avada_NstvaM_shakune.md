## English translation:

“When uttering your cry, O Bird, proclaim good fortune; when sitting silently cherish kind thoughts towards us; when you cry as you are flying, let the sound be like that of a lute; so that, blessed with excellent descendants, we may worthily praise you at this sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like that of a lute: karkarir yathā: the **karkari** is a musical instrumental ument: **vādya** **viśeṣaḥ**
