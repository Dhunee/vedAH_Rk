## English translation:

“That opulent donation which proceeds, **Indra**, from you, assuredly bestows upon him who praises you, the boon (that he desires); grant (it) to (us) your adorers; do not you, who are the object of adoration, disregard our prayers; so that, blessed with worthy descendants, we may glorify you at this sacrifice.”
