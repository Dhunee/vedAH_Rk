## English translation:

“All men offer worship to that adorable, powerful, and munificent (**Indra**), who is associated (with praise); therefore, (do you), who are liberal and most wise, worship him with oblations; and drink, Indra, the **Soma**, together with the Sun, the showerer (of benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Together with the Sun: vṛṣabheṇa bhānunā: **bhānu** = **agni**, fire
