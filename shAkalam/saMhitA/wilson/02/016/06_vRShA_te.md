## English translation:

“Your thunderbolt, **Indra**, is the rainer (of bounties); your chariot, the showerer (of blessings); your two horses, the shedders (of desires); your weapons the diffusers (of wishes); you reign, showerer (of benefits), over the inebriating **Soma**, the sprinkler (of delight); satiate yourself, Indra, with the good-diffusing Soma.”
