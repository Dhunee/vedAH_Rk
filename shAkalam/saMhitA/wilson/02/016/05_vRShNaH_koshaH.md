## English translation:

“The juice of the gratifying and exhilarating (**Soma**), the exciter (of) those who drink it, flows to the showerer (of benefits), the dispenser of food, for his beverage; the two priests, the sprinklers of the oblation; and the stones (that express the Soma), offer to the best (of the deities), the Soma, the shedder (of blessings).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soma juice which is **vṛṣan** flows (to) **vṛṣabha**, **Indra**, who is also vṛṣabhānau; the two priests, **adhvaryu** and pratiṣṭhāta are both **vṛṣabhas**;so are the stones used to bruise the Soma; Soma juice is **vṛṣaṇa**; so, the thunderbolt is **vṛṣa**; the car is vṛṣa; the horses, vṛṣṇau; the weapons are vṛṣabhāṇi; Indra and Soma are both designated vṛṣabha; all these forms such vṛṣan, vṛṣaṇa, vṛṣabha are from the radical vṛs. = lit. to rain, and implying raining, shedding, showering, sprinkling; or bestowing freely or liberally, when used, as they most commonly are, in a figurative sense
