## English translation:

“Victorious in battle, (through) your (favour) I approach you, who are gratified by praise, in sacred rites with prayer, as a boat (to bear me over misfortune); may **Indra** listen attentively to these our words; we pour out libations to Indra, (who is a receptacle) of treasure, as a well (is of water).”
