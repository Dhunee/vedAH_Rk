## English translation:

“As a virtuous (maiden), growing old in the same dwelling with her parents, (claims from them her support), so come I to you for wealth; make it conspicuous, measure it, bring it (hither), grant (a sufficient) portion for my bodily sustenance, (such as that) wherewith you honour (your worshippers).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As a virtuous maiden: amājur iva pitroḥ sacā **satī** samānāt: amājuḥ = living at home during life;

Satī = daughter, duhitā, who claims her portion
