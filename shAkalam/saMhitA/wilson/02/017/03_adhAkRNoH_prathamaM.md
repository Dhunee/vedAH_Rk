## English translation:

“Verily, **Indra**, you have displayed your first great prowess, when, (propitiated) by the prayer (of the worshipper), you have put forth your withering (vigour) in his presence; and when the congregated enemies (of the gods), hurled down by you in youur chariot, drawn by your horses, fled, scattered.”
