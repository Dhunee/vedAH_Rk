## English translation:

“You, **Agni**, are **Tvaṣṭā**, (the giver) of great wealth to (your) worshipper; these praises are yours; do you, of benevolent power, (admit) our affinity; you, who are prompt to encourage (us), give us good (store of) horses; you, who abound with opulence, are the strength of men.”
