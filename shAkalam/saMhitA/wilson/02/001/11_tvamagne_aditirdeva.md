## English translation:

“You, divine **Agni**, are **Aditi** to the donor of the oblation; you are **Hotā** and **Bhāratī**, and thive by praise; you are Iḷā of a hundred winters to him who makes you gifts; you, lord of wealth, are the destroyer of **Vṛtra**, **Sarasvatī**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Iḷā of a hundred winters: tvam iḷā;

Śatahimāsi = the earth of unlimited duration, aparimitakāla **bhūmiḥ**; destroyer of Vṛtra: **vṛtrahā** = destroyer of sin
