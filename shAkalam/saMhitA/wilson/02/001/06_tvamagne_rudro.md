## English translation:

“You, **Agni**, are **Rudra**, the expeller (of foes) from the expanse of heaven; you are the strength of the **Maruts**; you are supreme over (sacrificial) food; you, who are plural asantly domiciled (in the hall of sacrifice), go with ruddy horses, (fleet as) the wind; as **Pūṣan**, you cherish, of yours own will, those who offer worship.”
