## English translation:

“You, **Agni**, are (ever) resplendent, and are to be glorified when present; you are lord over all renowned food and riches; you shine brightly, and you consume (the oblation) for him who offers it; you are the especial accomplisher of the sacrifice, and bestower (of its rewards).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Resplendent: tvam **agna** **ṛbhuḥ**, tvam. vājasya īśiṣe: **ṛbhu** = bhāsamānaḥ, shining;

Vājasya = annasya, of food
