## English translation:

“Sovereign of men, **Agni**, you are born for the days (of sacrifice), pure and all-irradiating, from the waters, from the stones, from trees, and from plural nts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Suśukṣaṇi = drying up, causing the evaporation of the earth's moisture; or, it may mean: destroying, consuming; Agni is produced from the waters, either as lightning that accompanies rain or submarine fire; from stones by striking them together; so from trees or wood by attrition; from plural nts, such as bamboo, by mutual friction, causing the conflagration of a forest
