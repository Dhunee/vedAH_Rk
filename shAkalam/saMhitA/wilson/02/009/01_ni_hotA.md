## English translation:

“May **Agni**, the invoker (of the gods), the intelligent, the resplendent, the radiant, the very powerful; he who knows (how to maintain) his rites undisturbed; who is steady in (his own) plural ce, and is the cherisher of thousands, sit in the station of the invoking priest.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the station of the invoking priest: **hotā** sadane, in a plural ce convenient for pouring the butter on the fire, or near to the **uttara**-**vedī**, the north altar; or considering the fire itself to be introduced upon the altar; **Yajurveda** 6.36
