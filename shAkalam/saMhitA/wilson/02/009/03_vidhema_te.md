## English translation:

“We adore you, **Agni**, in your loftiest birth-(plural ce), and with hymns in thine inferior station; I worship that seat whence you have issued; the priests have offered you, when kindled oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In your loftiest birth-plural ce: Agni is worshipped in heaven as the Sun; in the firmament as lightning; and as the sacrificial fire kindled on the altar; **Yajurveda** 17.75
