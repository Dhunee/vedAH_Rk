## English translation:

“It has been partaken (by **Indra**) for his exhilaration, of this agreeable (sacrificial) food, the libation of his devout (worshipper); thriving by which ancient (**Soma**),he has bestowed a (fitting) dwelling, where the adoring conductors (of the ceremony) abide.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

It has been partaken: apāyi **asya** andhasaḥ: used impersonally, 3rd person singular of the 3rd preterite, passive voice; it may as well be used for the imperative and is equated to: **indraḥ** **somam** pitabu = may Indra drink the Soma
