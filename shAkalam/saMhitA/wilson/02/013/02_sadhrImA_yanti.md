## English translation:

“The aggregated (streams) come, bearing everywhere the water, and conveying it as sustenance for the asylum of all rivers, (the ocean); the samepath is (assigned) to all the descending (currents) to follow; and as he, who has (assigned) them (their course), you, (**Indra**), are especially to be praised.”
