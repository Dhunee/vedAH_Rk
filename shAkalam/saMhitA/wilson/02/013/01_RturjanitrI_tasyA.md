## English translation:

“The season (of the rains) is the parent (of the **Soma**), which, as soon as born of her, enters into the waters in which it grows; thence it is fit for expression, as concentrating (the essence of the) water, and the juice of the Soma is especially to be praised (as the libation proper for **Indra**).”
