## English translation:

“Distributing nourishment to their progeny, they, (the householders), abide (in their dwellings), as if offering ample and sustaining wealth to a guest; constructing (useful works, a man) eats with his teeth the food (given him) by (his) protector and as he, who has enjoined these (things to be done), you, (**Indra**), are especially to be praised.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Constructing useful works: asinvan daṃṣṭraiḥ pitur **atti** bhojanam: asinvan = setubandhādikam **karma** kurvan, doing acts, such as building bridges and the like;

Pituḥ = **pālaka**, the fostering heaven, from which comes the rain that causes the growth of grain, for the sustenance of man
