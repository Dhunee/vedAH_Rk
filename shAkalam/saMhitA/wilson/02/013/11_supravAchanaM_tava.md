## English translation:

“Your heroism, hero, is to be glorified, by which, with single effort, you have acquired wealth; (wherewith) the (sacrificial) food of (every) solemn and constant (ceremony is provided); for all (the acts) you have performed, you, **Indra**, are he who is to be praised.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Wherewith the sacrificial food: jātūṣṭhirasya pra **vayaḥ** sahasvato: jātuṣṭhara may be a proper name; i.e. you have given (pra = pradaḥ) food to the vigorous jātuṣṭhara; alternatively, Indra being the occasional (**jātu**) agent in sacrificial offerings (**vayas**) in relation to constant and essential ceremonies: sthirasya balavato yajñādeḥ karmaṇaḥ **sambandhi** vayas
