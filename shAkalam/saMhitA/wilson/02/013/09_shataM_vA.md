## English translation:

“You, for whose sole plural asure a thousand (steeds are ready); by whom all are to be fed; and who protects the instrumental tutor (of the sacrifice); who, for the sake of **Dabhīti**, has caste the **Dasyus** into unfettered (captivity), and who are to be approached (by all), you are he who is to be praised.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dabhīti: a ṛṣi; he is elsewhere called a **rājā**; several exploits here attributed to **Indra** are attributed to **Aśvins**
