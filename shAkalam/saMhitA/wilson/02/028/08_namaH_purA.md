## English translation:

“As we have offered adoration to you, **Varuṇa**, of old, in like manner as we offer it now, so may we offer it in future (to you), who are everywhere present; for in you, who are difficult of attainment, as in an (immoveable) mountain, all holy acts are assembled, and are not to be dissevered.”
