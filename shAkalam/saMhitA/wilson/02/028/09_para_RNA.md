## English translation:

“Discharge, **Varuṇa**, the debts (contracted), by my progenitors, and those now (contracted) by me; and may I not, royal Varuṇa, be dependent (on the debts contracted) by another; many are the mornings that have, as it were, indeed not dawned; make us, Varuṇa, alive in them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May I not be dependent: māham rājannanyakṛtena bhojam = lit. may I not enjoy by what is made by another; i.e., may I not obtain enjoyment by the wealth that is acquired by another; but,mat-kṛtāni, made by me, refers to ṛṇa (for ṛṇāni, debts); many are the mornings: avyuṣṭā innu bhūyasīruṣāsaḥ ā no jīvān tāsu śādhi = liṭ, unrisen, verily indeed, many morning dawns, make us alive in them; i.e., person ns involved in debt are so overcome with anxiety that they are not conscious of the dawn of day, to them the morning has not dawned, they are dead tothe light of day
