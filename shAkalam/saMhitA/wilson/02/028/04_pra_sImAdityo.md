## English translation:

“The **Āditya**, the upholder, has created all this water; the rivers flow by the power of **Varuṇa**; they never weary, they never stop; they have descended with swiftness, like birds upon the circumambient (earth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Has created all this water: pra sīm aṣrjad ṛtam; the word ṛtam has many interpretations: truth, sacrifice, water; sindhavo varuṇasya yanti, rivers go of Varuṇa, or by his will or power; like birds upon the circumambient earth: paptū raghuyā parijman;

Parijman = lit. that which goes about or round; or, revolving; this is an epithet of **bhūmi**: parijmani bhūmyām
