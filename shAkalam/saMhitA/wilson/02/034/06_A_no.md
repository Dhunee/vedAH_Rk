## English translation:

“**Maruts**, who are of one mind, come to the food that is offered at (our) sacrifices, as (you come) to the praises of men; nourish the cow, (the cloud), so that it may be like a mare with a full udder, and render the pious rite productive of abundant food to the worshipper.”
