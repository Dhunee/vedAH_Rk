## English translation:

“The **Maruts**, shedders of showers, endowed with resistless might, like formidable lions, reverencing (the world) by their energies, resplendent as fires, laden with water, and blowing about the wandering cloud, give vent to its (collected) rain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Laden with water: ṛjīṣiṇaḥ = from f.jīṣa, water; or it may mean, **soma** that has lost its strength: ṛjīṣa, apagata **sāraḥ** **somaḥ**
