## English translation:

“**Maruts**, your marvellous energy is well known, whereby, seizing the udder of heaven, you milked it (of the rain, destroyed) the reviler of your worshipper, and (came), irresistible sons of **Rudra**, to **Trita** for the destruction of enemies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trita = a ṛṣi
