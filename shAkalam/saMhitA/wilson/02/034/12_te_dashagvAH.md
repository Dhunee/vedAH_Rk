## English translation:

“May they, who, the first celebrators of the ten-months' rite, accomplished this sacrifice, reanimate us at the rising dawn; for as the dawn with purple rays drives away the night, so (do they scatter the darkness) with great, and pure, and mist-dispelling radiance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The first celebration of the ten-months' rite: te daśagvāḥ **prathamā** yajñam ūhire: in RV. 2.5.4, daśagvāḥ = those who originally were priests of the school of **aṅgiras**, conducting ceremonies that lasted nine or ten days; here, the office is assigned to the **Maruts**, as the first celebrators of the rite; they are, therefore, identified with the **aṅgirasas**-- aṅgirasas tad **rūpa** bhūtvā **marutaḥ**, who were the first, or prior to the **Ādityas**; the legend: there was a competition for precedence in going to **svarga**, between the ādityas and the aṅgirasas, and the latter acquired it, by first instrumental tuting sacrifices with fire, ādityaścaiva iha asann aṅgirasaśca te agre agninā agnim ayajanta = the ādityas were also here and the aṅgirasas; they (the latter) first worshipped **Agni** with fire
