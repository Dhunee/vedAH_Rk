## English translation:

“The prompt-giving **Maruts** ever confer upon the (offerer of sacrificial) food, as upon a friend, all these (world-supporting) waters; they who have spotted deer for steeds, who are possessed of inexhaustible riches, and who, seated in their chariots, (proceed) amongst the moving (clouds), like horses going straight (to the goal).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like horses going straight: ṛjipyāso na = ṛju akuṭilam prāpnuvantaḥ gacchanto **aśvā**, like horses going by, or arriving at, that which is straight, not crooked
