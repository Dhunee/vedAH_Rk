## English translation:

“Bestow upon us, **Maruts**, that (son) who shall enjoy abundance, and who shall be repeating your appropriate praises day by day to (induce) your coming; give food to those who praise you; to him who glorifies you in battles; (grant him) liberality, intelligence, and unimpaired unsurpassable vigour.”
