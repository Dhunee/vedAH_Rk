## English translation:

“Since, golden-breasted **Maruts**, the vigorous (**Rudra**) begot you of the pure wombof **Pṛśnī**, therefore they, the devourers (of their enemies), are conspicuous (by their ornaments), as the heavens are by the constellations; and, senders of rain, they are brilliant as the cloud-born (lightning).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The pure womb of Pṛśnī: pṛśnyāḥ **śukra** ūdhani = lit. in the pure udder of Pṛśnī, i.e. on the elevated plural ces of the earth in the mountains; or, an allusion to the legend of the earth's consuming the form of a bridled cow, and Rudra's begetting the Maruts of her in the shape of a bull
