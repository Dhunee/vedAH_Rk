## English translation:

“They sprinkle the wide-extended (lands) with water, as (men sprinkle) horses (when heated) in battles; and they rush along with swift (horses) on the skirts of the sounding (cloud); **Maruts**, golden-helmeted, andof one mind, agitating (the trees), come with your spotted deer to (receive the sacrificial) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With swift horses on the skirts: nadasya karṇaisturayanta āśubhiḥ = liṭ, they hasten with quick ears of the sound; horses are implied; the ears signify the middle parts of that which emits sound, i.e. the cloud; golden-helmeted: hiraṇyaśipraḥ: **śipra** = the nose, or the lower law; here explained as śirastrāṇa = a head-guard, a helmet
