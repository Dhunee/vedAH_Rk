## English translation:

“Imploring them for ample wealth, and (having recourse to him) for protection, we glorify them with this praise; like the five chief priests whom **Trita** detained for the (performance of) the sacrifice, and to protect it with their weapons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the five chief priests: trita na yān **pañca** hotṛn abhiṣṭaye āvavartad avarān cakriya āvase: the allusion is to the practice of mysticism, or **yoga**; the five **hotṛs** or offerers of the **Soma**, being the five vital airs, whom Trita, as a **Yogi**, suppressed, and compelled to concentrate themselves in the **Cakra**, or umbilical region for the attainement of superhuman faculties;

Avarān = homaniṣpādakān mukhyān, the chief offerers of the Soma; pañca hotṛn adhyātmaprāṇāpānādi pañca vṛttyātmanā vartmānān, ata eva homaniṣpādakān mukhyān, abiṣṭaye abhilaṣitasiddhyartham cakriyā nābhīcakreṇa avitum saṅgantum āvavartat; svasmān nirjigamiṣūn prāṇān svātmābhimukuham āvartayat, he compelled the vital airs, desirous of issuing from himself to turn back into the presence of himself, and to concentrate with the umbilical cakra, for the entire completion of the rite; (those airs being) the chief offerers of the oblation abiding in the spirit, as **prāṇa**, **apāna** and the rest, constituting the five ministering priests; a less mystical interpretation turns upon the sense of cakriyā, with a spear or lance, ṛṣṭyākhyena āyudhena
