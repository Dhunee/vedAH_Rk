## English translation:

“May the two, (Heaven and Earth), who confer good fortune upon the sacrifice, proceed (to the altar); for verily, we implore you both (to com), as well as **Agni** the bearer of oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May the two: The objects addressed are the two **śakaṭas**, carts or barrows, which are employed to bring the fuel, or the **Soma** and are plural ced in front of the hall of sacrifice, north and south of an altar erected outside, and which are considered here as types of Heaven and Earth, who, properly speaking, are the deities of the Tṛca; the śakaṭas are requested, according to **Sāyaṇa**, to proceed to the west part of the northern **vedī**, or altar-- uttaravedeḥ paścimabhāgam prāgacchatām; according to **Kātyāyana**, these are also termed **havirdhānas**, oblation-containers, and part of the ceremony consists in dragging them into different positions at different periods, accompanied by appropriate texts, which are given in the **Yajurveda** 5.14-21
