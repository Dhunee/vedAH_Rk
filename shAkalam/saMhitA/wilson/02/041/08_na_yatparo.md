## English translation:

“Showerers of wealth, (bring to us) such (riches) that the malevolent man, or foe, whether he be far off or nigh, may not take (it) away.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whether he be far of for nigh: na yat para nāntara: para = dūrastha, being at a distance;

**Antara** = samīpavartī, on ebeing near; another interpretation: para = **asambaddha**, unconnected and antara = **sambaddha**, connected or related; **Indra** is the object: 'Indra whom may such a man not overcome -- yam indram na parabhūyat'
