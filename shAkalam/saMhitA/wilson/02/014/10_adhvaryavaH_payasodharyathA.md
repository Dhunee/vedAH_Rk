## English translation:

“Priests, fill the bountiful **Indra** with libations as the udder of a cow is filled with milk; so shall the adorable (Indra) fully comprehend (the liberality) of him who desires to present the gift, and shall say (to him), I acknowledge the secret (virtue) of this my (draught).”
