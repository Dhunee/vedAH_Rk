## English translation:

“Priests, offer the **Soma** to that **Indra**, who slew Svaśna, the unabsorbable **Śuṣṇa**, and mutilated (**Vṛtra**), who destroyed Pipru, **Namuci** and Rudhikrā.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Svaśna su aśnate = he who devours; su may also relate to the verb jaghāna, well-slew; Namuci destroys by the foam of the sea: apām phenena namuci **śiraḥ** indra udavartayat (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 1.7.1.5-6)
