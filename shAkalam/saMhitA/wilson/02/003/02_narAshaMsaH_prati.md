## English translation:

“May the bright Narāśaṃsa, illuminating the receptacles (of the offering) making manifest by his greatness the three radiant (regions) and diffusing the oblation at the season of sacrifice with butter-dispensing purpose, satisfy the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Narāśaṃsa: in the preceding **sūktas**, **tanūnapāt** is the second person nification of **Agni** addressed; in this **sūkta**, he is omitted
