## English translation:

“I sprinkle the butter, for butter is his birth-plural ce; he is nourished by butter; butter is his radiance; **Agni**, showerer (of benefits), bring the gods to the offered oblation; exhilarate them; convey to them the offering that has been reverently sanctified.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Cf. **Yajurveda** 17.88; **dhāma** - dwelling, or radiance; alternative reading: **Adhvaryu**, or priest, bring hither Agni to the oblation; exhilarate him; (and say to him). Showerer (of blessings), convey the consecrated oblation (to the gods).
