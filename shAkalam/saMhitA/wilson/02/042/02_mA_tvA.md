## English translation:

“May no kite, no eagle, kill you; may no archer armed with arrows, reach you; crying repeatedly, in the region of the **Pitā**, be ominous of good fortune; proclaimer of good luck, speak to us on this occasion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the region of the pitā: the south; the cry of the birds on the south is a good omen, cf. next hymn
