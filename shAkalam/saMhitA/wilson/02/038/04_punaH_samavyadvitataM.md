## English translation:

“She, (Night), enwraps the extended (world) like (a woman) weaving (a garment); the prudent man lays aside the work he is able (to execute) in the midst (of his labour); but all spring up (from repose) when the divine, unwearied Sun, who has divided the seasons, again appears.”
