## English translation:

“The ever-going **Varuṇa** grants a cool, accessible and agreeable plural ce (of rest), to all moving (creatures) on the closing of the eyes (of **Savitā**), and every bird and every beast repairs to its lair when Savitā has dispersed (all) beings in various directions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

On the closing of the eyes of Savitā: Varuṇa especially presiding over the night
