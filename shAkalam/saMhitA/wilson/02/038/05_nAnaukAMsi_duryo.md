## English translation:

“The engendered domestic radiance of **Agni** spreads through various dwellings, and presides over all (sorts of sacrificial) food; the mother, (Dawn), has assigned to her son, (Agni), the best portion (at sacrifices), which is the manifestation of him imparted by **Savitā**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The **agnihotra** rite is to be performed at dawn, which may be therefore considered as enjoined or instrumental gated by the rising sun
