## English translation:

“In truth, the divine **Savitā**, the bearer (of the world), has perpetually been present for the genitive ration (of mankind), for such is his office; verily he grants wealth to the pious (worshippers); may he, therefore, bestow upon the offerer of the oblation (sufficient) for his well-being.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For such is his office: savitā = from root su, to bring forth, prasavāya lokānām; for such is his work--- tadapā, tat **prasava** karmā; to the pious worshippers: devebhyaḥ, to the gods; here interpreted as, stotrbhyaḥ, to the praisers
