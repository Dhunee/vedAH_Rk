## English translation:

“May that young, adorable **Indra**, ever be the friend, the benefactor, and protector of us, his worshipper; who, with his protection, may conduct (to the object of his worship) him who repeats (to him) prayer and praise, who prepares the oblation, and recites (his) commendations.”
