## English translation:

“**Indra**, the slayer of **Vṛtra**, the destroyer of cities, has scattered the black-sprung servile (hosts); he engendered the earth and the waters for **Manu**; may he fulfill the entire prayer of the sacrificer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Has scattered the black-sprung servile hosts: kṛṣnayonir dāsīr airyad vi, he scattered the sacrifice-disturbing **asura** armies {kṛṣṇayoni = nikṛṣṭa **jāti**;

**Dāsī** = upakṣapayitrī, **āsurī** **senā** (army}; another interpretation: pregnant wife of the asura named **kṛṣṇa** (yaḥ kṛṣṇāgarbhāḥ nirahanṛjiśvanā: RV 1.101.1)
