“We bring to you, **Indra**, (sacrificial) food, as one desiring food brings his wagon; regard us benevolently when glorifying you, rendering (you) illustrious by (our) praise, and soliciting such guides as you are to felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As one desiring food brings: vājayurna ratham: yathā annamiccahanpumān śakaṭam sampādayati, as a man, wishing food, provides his cart or barrow to take it away
