## English translation:

“Let us not provoke you, **Rudra**, to wrath by our (imperfect) adorations; nor, showerer (of benefits), by our unworthy praise, nor by our invocation (of other deities); invigorate our sons by your medicinal plural nts, for I hear that you are a chief physician amongst physicians.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
