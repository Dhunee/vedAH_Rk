## English translation:

“May I pacify by my praises that **Rudra**, who is worshipped with invocations and oblations; and never may he who is soft-bellied, of a tawny hue, and handsome chin; who is reverently invoked; subject us to that malevolent disposition (that purposes our destruction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soft-bellied: ṛdūdara babhruvarṇa suśipra: ṛdūdara = **mṛdu** **udara**, having a soft belly (**Nirukta** 6.4); that malevolent disposition: mā no asyai rīradhan manāyai: **manā** = hannīti manyamānā **buddhiḥ**, the mind meditating, I kill
