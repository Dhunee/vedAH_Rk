## English translation:

“Cherisher of the world, showerer (of benefits), omniscient and divine (**Rudra**), hearer of our invocation, so consider us on this occasion, that you may not be irate, nor slay us; but that, blessed with excellent descendants, we may worthily glorify you at this sacrifice.”
