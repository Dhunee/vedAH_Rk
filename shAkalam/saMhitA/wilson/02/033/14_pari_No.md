## English translation:

“May the javelin of **Rudra** avoid us; may the great displeasure of the radiant deity pass away (from us); showerer of benefits, turn away your strong (bow) from the wealthy (offerers of oblations), and bestow happiness upon (our) sons and grandsons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 16.50: the end of the first half of the hymn reads: durmatir-aghāyoḥ, the displeasure of the sinful or the malevolent; **durmati**-**mahī** gāt = may the great displeasure pass away
