## English translation:

“Where, **Rudra**, is your joy-dispending **hand**, which is the healer and delighter (of all); showerer (of benefits), who are the dispeller of sins of the gods, quickly have compassion upon me.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The dispeller of the sins of the gods: apabhartā rapaso daivyasya = devakṛtasya pāpasya apahartā, the taker-away of sin committed by a divinity; **daivya** may also connote sin against the gods
