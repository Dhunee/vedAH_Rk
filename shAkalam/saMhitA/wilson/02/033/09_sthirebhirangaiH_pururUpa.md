## English translation:

“(Firm) with strong limbs, assuming many forms fierce, and tawny-coloured, he shines with brilliant golden ornaments; vigour is inseparable from **Rudra**, the supreme ruler and lord of this world.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vigour: asuryam = **bala**, strength; or, it may connect Rudra with the **asuras**
