## English translation:

“He, the seven-rayed, the showerer, the powerful, who let loose the seven rivers to flow; who, armed with the thunderbolt, crushed **Rauhiṇa** when scaling heaven; he, men, is **Indra**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven-rayed: the seven rays, raśmayaḥ = seven forms of **Parjanya** (**Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** 1.9.4-5), or Indra, as the rain-cloud; or seven kinds of rain-clouds
