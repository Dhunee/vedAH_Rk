## English translation:

“**Indra**, who are difficult of approach; you, verily, are a true (benefactor), who bestows (abundant) food upon him who offers the libation, who prepares (the mixed curds and butter); may we, enjoying your favour, blessed with progeny, daily repeat (your praises) at the sacrifice.”
