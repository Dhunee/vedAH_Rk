## English translation:

“He, who as soon as born,is the first (of the deities); who has done honour to the gods by his exploits; he, at whose might heaven and earth are alarmed, and (who is known) by the greatness of his strength, he, men, is **Indra**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who has done honour to the gods by his exploits: who has preserved or protected them, or has surpassed them: prayarakṣad atyakrāmad iti vā (**Nirukta** 10.10); **Atharvaveda** 20.34; he, men, is Indra: sa janāsa Indra = **janā**, he **asurāḥ**; the legend: **Gṛtsamada**,by his devotions, acquired a form as vast as that of Indra, visible at once in heaven, in the firmament, and on earth; the two **asuras**, **Dhuni** and Cumuri \[Bṛhaddevatā 4.66-67), mistaking him, therefore, for Indra, were proceeding to attack him, when he arrested their advance by repearing this hymn, intimating that he was not Indra; another legend: when Indra and the gods were present at a sacrifice celebrated by **Vainya**, Gṛtsamada was one of the officiating priests; the asuras came to the spot to kill Indra, who, assuming the likeness of Gṛtsamada, went away without question; when the assembly broke up, and Gṛtsamada went out, the asuras, who had been lying in wait, considered him to be Indra, and were about to fall upon him, when he diverted from their purpose by reciting this hymn, showing that Indra was a different person n; another legend: Indra came alone to the sacrifice of Gṛtsamada, and being, as before away laid by the asuras, asumed the person n of the ṛṣi and coming forth, returned to **svarga**; after waiting sometime, the asuras entered the chamber of sacrifice, and laid hold of Gṛtasamads, conceving that Indra had assumed his person n until they were person aded of their mistake by the repetition of the entire **sūkta** (**Mahābhārata**)
