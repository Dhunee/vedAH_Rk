## English translation:

“**Tvaṣṭā** engendered you (chief) amongst all beings, (whence) you are the reciter of many a holy hymn: **Brahmaṇaspati** acknowledges a debt to the performer of a sacred rite; he is the acquitter (of the debt), and the destoyer of the oppressor.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When you are the reciter: sāmnaḥ sāmnaḥ **kaviḥ**, the reicter or another of every **sāma**, sarvasya sāmnaḥ uccārayitā kartāsi; or **kavi** refers to tvaṣṭā, further explained as the sage who created Brahmaṇaspati by the efficacy of the sāma: sāmnaḥ sāreṇa tvam ajījanat; acknowledges a debt: ṛṇacit stotṛkāmam ṛṇam iva cinoti, he takes the intention of the praiser as if it was a debt, or obligation; acquitter of the debt: ṛṇaya is explained as the discharger or remover of the debt which is of the nature of sin: pāparūpasya ṛṇasya **pṛthak** **kartā**
