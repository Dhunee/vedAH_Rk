## English translation:

“**Bṛhaspati**, destroyer of the **asuras**, through you the intelligent gods have obtained the sacrificialportion; in like manner as the adorable sun genitive rates the (solar) rays by his radiance, so are you the genitive rator of all prayers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛhaspati = **Brahmaṇaspati**; perhaps Bṛhaspati is of a more martial character; his protection is souhght for against enemies and evil spirits; perhaps, bṛhatām vedānām **pālakaḥ**: **bṛhat** = **mantra**, bṛhato mantrasya, **svāmin**
