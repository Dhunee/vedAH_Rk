## English translation:

“You lead men, **Bṛhaspati**, by virtuous instrumental uctions; you preserve them (from calamity); sin will never overtake him who presents (offerings) to you; you are the afflicter of him who hates (holy) prayers; you are the punisher of wrath; such is your great mightiness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Him who hates holy prayers: brahmadviṣaḥ = those who hate either the **brāhmaṇas**,or the **mantras** or prayers
