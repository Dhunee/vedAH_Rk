## English translation:

“Deliver us not to the thieves, the enemies delighting in violence, who seize ever upon the food (of others); those who cherish in their hearts the abandonment (of the gods); (they), **Bṛhaspati**, who do not know the extent of (your) power (against evil spirits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who do not know the extenf of your power: na **paraḥ** sāmno viduḥ = ye pumāmsaḥ sāmnaḥ sāmayāt tvattaḥ paraḥ parastād anyadukṛṣṭam **sāma** yad rakṣoghnam na jānanti, those men who do not know anything greater than the faculty of destroying **rākṣasas**, derived from you made up of that faculty; sāma vai rakṣoha = sāma is the killer of rākṣasas
