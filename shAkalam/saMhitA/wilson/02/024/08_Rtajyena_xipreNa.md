## English translation:

“Whatever **Brahmaṇaspati** aims at with the truth-strung quick-darting bow, that (mark) he surely attains; holy are its arrows with which he shoots (intended) for the eyes of men, and having their abode in the ear.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For the eyes of men: nṛcakṣasaḥ karṇayonayaḥ: the arrows are oblations and **mantras**; the first is obvious to the sight; the second is addressed to the ears of men
