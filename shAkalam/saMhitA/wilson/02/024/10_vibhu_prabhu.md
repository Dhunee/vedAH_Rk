## English translation:

“Expansive, vast, and excellent riches, are the attainable (bounties) of **Bṛhaspati**, the sender of the rain; these are the gifts of the adorable giver of food, whereby both (descriptions of worshippers) entering here enjoy (abundance).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Whereby both: yena **janā** ubhaye bhuñjate **viśaḥ**: the two sorts of person ns are either the **yajamāna**, or host and the officiating priests; or they may be gods and men; viśo niviṣṭaḥ santo bhuñjate bhogān labhanti, being entered or seated, they enjoy; they obtain enjoyments
