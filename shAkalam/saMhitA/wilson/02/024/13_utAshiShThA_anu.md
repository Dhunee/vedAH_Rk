## English translation:

“The very swift horses (of **Brahmaṇaspati**) listen to (our invocation); the priest of the assembly offers with praise the (sacrificial) wealth; may Brahmaṇaspati, the hater of the oppressor, accept (the payment of) the debt, agreeably to his plural asure; may he be the accepter of the (sacrificial) food presented at this ceremony.”
