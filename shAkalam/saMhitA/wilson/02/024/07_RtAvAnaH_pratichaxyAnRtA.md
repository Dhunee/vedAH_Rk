## English translation:

“Those sages, eminent for truth, having seen through the false (illusions of the **asura**), again pursued the main road thither, and with their **hands** cast against the rock the destructive fire, which, till then, was not there.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nakh ṣo **asti** = that is not; i.e. so **agniḥ** pūrvam tatra nakir asti, na vidyate, that fire formerly is not there, is not known; but they, of their own power, having produced the fire that was not known, or was not extant, threw it there: avidyamānam agnim svasāmarthyād utpādya tatra pracikṣipuḥ; this is an allusion to the dissemination of fire-worship by the **aṅgirasas**
