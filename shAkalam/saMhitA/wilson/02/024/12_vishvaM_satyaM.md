## English translation:

“All truth, lords of wealth, (**Indra** and **Brahmaṇaspati**), is (inherent) in you both; the waters injure not your rites; come to our presence (to receive) our oblations, like a pair of steeds (to receive) their provender.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The waters injure not your rites: āpaśca na praminanti vratam vām: āpaḥ = by metonymy, for all human beings, sarvāṇi bhūtani
