## English translation:

“That was the exploit, (performed) for the most divine of the gods, by which the firm (**shut** gates) were thrown open, the strong (barriers) were relaxed, (by him) who set the cows at liberty; who, by the (force of the) sacred prayer, destroyed **Bala** who dispersed the darkness and displayed the light.”
