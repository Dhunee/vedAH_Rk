## English translation:

“For you, (worshipper), the constant and manifold (bounties of **Brahmaṇaspati**), through months and through years, set open the gates of the future rains, and he has appointed those results of prayer, which the two regions mutually and without effort provide.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of the future rains: **bhuvana** bhavitvā = udakānām bhavyānām; which the two regions mutually: **vayunā** **cakāra**: jñānāni **mantra** viṣayāṇi, he made the knowledge the object of prayer; which the āyatamānau aprayatnau;or, the two, to mean heaven and earth, which without effort, pass to one another, anyadanyati carataḥ; i.e., by virtue of prayer and sacrifice, rain is engendered in the sky, which coming down upon the earth, causes fertility, whence food for men or for sacrifice is provided; which, being offered, is again productive of rain, and thus, as the result of prayer, a mutual and spontaneous interchange of benefits between heaven and earth is perpetuated
