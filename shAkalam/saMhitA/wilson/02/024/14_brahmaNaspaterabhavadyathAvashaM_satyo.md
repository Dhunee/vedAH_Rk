## English translation:

“The purpose of **Brahmaṇaspati**, engaging in a great work, has been successful, according to his wish; for he it was who recovered (the stolen) cattle for (the dwellers in) heaven; and distrubuted them; so that of their own power they took different directions, like (the branches of) a mighty river.”
