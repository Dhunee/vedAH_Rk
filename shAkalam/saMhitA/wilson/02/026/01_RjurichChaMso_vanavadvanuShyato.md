## English translation:

“May the sincere praiser (of **Brahmaṇaspati**) verily overcome (his) enemies; may the worshipper of the gods overcome him assuredly who does not reverence them; may the propitiatir (of Brahmaṇaspati) overcome him who is difficult to be overcome in battles; may he who offers sacrifice appropriate the food of him who does not sacrifice.”
