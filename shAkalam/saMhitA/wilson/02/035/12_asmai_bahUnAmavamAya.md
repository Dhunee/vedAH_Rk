## English translation:

“To him our friend, the first of many (deities), we offer worship with sacrifices, oblations, and prostration; I decorate the high plural ce (of his presence); I nourish him with fuel; I sustain him with (sacrificial) viands; I glorify him with hymns.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The first of many: bahūnām avamāya, the best of many, i.e. of the gods, as in the **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**: agnir vai devānām avamaḥ, i.e. devānām, madhye **prathamaḥ**, the first amongst the gods
