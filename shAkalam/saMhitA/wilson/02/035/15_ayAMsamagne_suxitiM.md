## English translation:

“I have come, **Agni**, to you, (the giver) of good dwellings, for the sake of offspring; I have come with a propitiatory hymn for the sake of the opulent (offerers of oblations); may all the good which the gods defend (be ours); that, blessed with excellent descendants, we may worthily glorify you at this sacrifice.”
