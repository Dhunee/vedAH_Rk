## English translation:

“Vigorous, he has genitive rated himself as an embryo in those (waters); he is their infant; he sucks them; they bedew him (with moisture); the grandson of the waters of untarnished splendour has descended to this (earth) in the form of a different (fire).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Has descended to this earth: anyasya iva iha tanyā viveṣa, has entered here, verily, with the body of another; the substantive, fire, is understood; i.e. fire originally ethereal, has come upon earth as culinary and sacrificial fire
