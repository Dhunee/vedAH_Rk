## English translation:

“Some waters collect together (from the rain); others, (already collected on earth), unite with them; as rivers, they flow together to propitiate the ocean-fire; the pure waters are gathered round the pure and brilliant grandsons of the waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ocean-fire: ūrvam nadyaḥ pṛṇanti: **ūrva** = submarine fire, samudramadhye vartamānam vaḍavānalam; another explanation for the hymn: the ference is to two sorts of water:one termed **ekadhanāḥ**, the other vasatīvaryāḥ, apparently the juice of the **Soma**, as distinguished by their employment in the **Agni**-ṣomīya sacrifice, after collecting the fat of the victim, and which are to be mixed for the completion of the ceremony; the **mantra** used on the occasion is **yajus**. 6.23; in this **yajuṣ**, vasatīvarī = vasatīvarī saṃjñām somārthānām apām grahaṇam kāryam, the taking of the waters named vasatīvarī, which mean, the Soma is observed; cf. **Kātyāyana** **sūtras** 8.9, 7.10
