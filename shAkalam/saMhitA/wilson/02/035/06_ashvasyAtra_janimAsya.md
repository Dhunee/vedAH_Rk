## English translation:

“In him is the birth of the horse, of him is (the origin of) the world; do you, grandson of the (waters), protect the pious worshippers from the malevolence of the oppressor; those who give no offerings, those who practise untruths, attain not the inconceivable deity, whether abiding in the immature or the perfect waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In him is the birth of the horse: **aśvasya** atra **janimā** = here, or in him is the birth of the horse; allusion to the production of uccaisśravas, the horse of **Indra**, among the precious things obtained by the churning of the ocean; the birth of the horse from water, whethere of the ocean or not, is a legend; of him is the origin of the world: **asya** ca svaḥ: su, well, varaṇīya, to be chosen; implying the whole world; i.e. the deity residing amid the waters, or the rains, may be considered as the origin of all earthly things
