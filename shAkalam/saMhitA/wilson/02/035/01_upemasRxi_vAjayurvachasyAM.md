## English translation:

“Desiring food, I put forth this laudatory hymn; may the sounding and swift-moving grandson of the waters bestow abundant food upon me his worshipper; may he make us of goodly appearance, for verily he is propitiated by praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Grandson of the waters: apām **napāt**, the son of the trees or fuel which are the progeny of the rains; a different etymology makes the term an epithet of the sun
