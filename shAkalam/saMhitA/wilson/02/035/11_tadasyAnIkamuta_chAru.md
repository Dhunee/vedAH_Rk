## English translation:

“Beautiful is his form (of aggregated lustre, beautiful) is the name of the grandson of the waters; (both) flourish, though hidden (by the clouds); the youthful w2aters collectively kindle the golden-coloured divinity in the firmament, for water is his food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Both flourish though hidden by the clouds: apīcyam vardhate meghāntarhitam sad vardhate = increases though concealed by the clouds
