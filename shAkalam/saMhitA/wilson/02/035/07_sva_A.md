## English translation:

“He, the grandson of the waters, who abides in his own dwelling; of whom is the readily-milked cow; who augments the nectar (of the skies), and (thence) eats the sacrificial food; he, gathering strength in the midst of the waters, shines for the sake of conferring wealth upon his worshipper.”
