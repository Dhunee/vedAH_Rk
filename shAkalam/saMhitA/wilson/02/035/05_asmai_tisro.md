## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three divine feminine les: iḷā, **sarasvatī** and **bhāratī**,person nifications of sacred prayer or praise; as if formed in the waters: **kṛtā** iva upa hi prasarsre apsu, they have proceeded or issued, as if made, in the waters; sa pīyuṣam dhayati pūr vasūnām, he drinks the nectar, that is, the **Soma**, of those first born; the essence of the waters which were the first created things by **Brahmā**; pūrvam **brāhmaṇaḥ** sakāśād utpannānām apām sārabhūtam
