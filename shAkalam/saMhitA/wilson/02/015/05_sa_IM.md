## English translation:

“He tranquilized this great river, (so that it) might be crossed; he conveyed across it in safety (the sages) who had been unable to pass over it, and who, having crossed, proceeded to realize the wealthy they sought; in the exhilaration of the **Soma**, **Indra** has done these (deeds).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sa īm mahīm dhunim eto aramṇāt: **dhuni** = paruṣṇi or **irāvatī** river, because of its shaking or dissipating the sins of the worshippers: stotrṇn.ām pāpāni dhunoti paruṣṇi **nadī**
