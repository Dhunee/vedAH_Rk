## English translation:

“You have slain the **Dasyus** Cumuri and **Dhuni**, having cast them into (profound) sleep; you have protected **Dabhīti**, while his chamberlain gained in that (contest) the gold (of the **asuras**); in the exhilaration of the **Soma**, **Indra** has done these (deeds).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His chamberlain: rambhī cid atra vivide hiraṇyam: rambhī = vetradhārī, staff bearer; or, **dauvārika**, porter or door-keeper
