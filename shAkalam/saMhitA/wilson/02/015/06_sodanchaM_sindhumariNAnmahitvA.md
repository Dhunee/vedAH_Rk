## English translation:

“By his great power he turned the **Sindhu** towards the north; with his thunderbolt he ground to pieces the wagon of the dawn, scattering the tardy enemy with his swift forces; in the exhilaration of the **Soma**, **Indra** has done these (deeds).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He turned the Sindhu towards the north: sodañcam sindhum ariṇāt = sindhum prāñcam santam udanmukham akarot, he made the Sindhu being to the east, facing towards the north
