## English translation:

“As a river (washes away) its banks, so the devout worshipper, (of **Brahmaṇaspati**), overpowers his enemies by his strength, as a bull (overcomes) an ox; like the spreading flame of fire, it is impossible to stop him, whom Brahmaṇaspati makes his associate.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The father of the gods: devānām pitaram: pitaram = pālayitāram, the protector or cherisher
