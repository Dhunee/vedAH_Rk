## English translation:

“Be plural ased, **Agni**, with the fuel; be plural ased with the oblation; be plural ased with the sacred prayer that is good for man; be plural ased with holy praise, asylum of all; Agni, willing (to accept oblations), render all the great gods desirous (of the same), and with them all, and with the Ṛtu drink the oblation.”
