## English translation:

“Be gratified, Draviṇodas, by the sacrificial food presented as the offering of the **Hotā**; he desires, priests, a fall libation; present it to him, and influenced (by it, he will be your) benefactor; drink, Draviṇodas, along with the Ṛtus, the **Soma**, the offering of the Hotā.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Drink, Draviṇodas, along with the Ṛtus: **somam** draviṇodaḥ piba ṛtubhiḥ: this is the refrain of the next two hymns also and of the last hymn;

Ṛtus = the seasons, deities presiding over the months, in series: iṣa, **urjja**, **sahas**, **tapasya**
