## English translation:

“May **Pūṣaṇ**, who is the benefactor of all, be propitious to (this pious) rite; may **Soma**, the lord of wealth, grant us affluence; may **Aditi**, who is without an adversary, protect us, so that, blessed with excellent descendants, we may worthily glorify (you) at this sacrifice.”
