## English translation:

“One of them, (**Pūṣaṇ**), has made his dwelling above in the heaven; the other (**Soma**), upon earth, and in the firmament; may they both grant us much-desired and much-commended abundant wealth of cattle, the source to us (of enjoyment).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Upon earth and in the firmament: Soma abides on earth; on the firmament, he is the moon
