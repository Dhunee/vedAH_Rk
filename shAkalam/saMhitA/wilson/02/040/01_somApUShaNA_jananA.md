## English translation:

“**Soma** and **Pūṣaṇ**, you two are the genitive rators of riches, the genitive rators of heaven, the genitive rators of earth; as soon as born you are the guardians of the whole world; the gods have made you the source of immortality.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soma: by this we are to understand both the moon and the Soma, as further intimated in the fourth hymn; the source of immortality: akṛṇvan amṛtasya nābhim: ketum, the cause or source, amaraṇasya, of not dying
