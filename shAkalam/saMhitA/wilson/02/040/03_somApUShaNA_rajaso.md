## English translation:

“**Soma** and **Pūṣaṇ**, showerers (of benefits)m direct towards us the seven-wheeled car, the measure of the spheres, undistinguishable from the universe, everywhere existing, (guided) by five reins, and to be harnessed by the mind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven-wheeled car: sapra-**cakra**, the year, of seven seasons, reckoning the intercalary month as an additional ṛtu or season; five reins: again, a reference to the **solar year**, reduced by the amalgamation of the cold and dewy seasons into one, to five seasons: **dvādaśa** vai **māsāḥ** pañcartavo hemantaśiśirayoḥ samāsena, the twelve months are verily five seasons by the combination of the cold and dewy seasons
