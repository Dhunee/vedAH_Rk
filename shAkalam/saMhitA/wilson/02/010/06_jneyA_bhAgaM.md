## English translation:

“Overpowering (your foes) with lustre, may you recognize your portion; may we, having you for our messenger, recite (praise) like **Manu**; desiring wealth, I offer oblation with the sacrificial ladle and with praises, to that entire **Agni**, who rewards (the worshipper) with the sweet (fruit) of the sacrifice.”
