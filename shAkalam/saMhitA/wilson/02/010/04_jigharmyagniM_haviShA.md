## English translation:

“I offer oblations with butter to **Agni**, who spreads through all regions, vast, expanding, with all-comprehending form, nourished (with sacrificial) food, powerful, conspicuous.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Offer oblations with butter: jigharmy agnim haviṣā ghṛtena = a tva jigharmi **manasā** ghṛtena (**Yajus**. 11.23), I sprinkle you with butter, with a believing mind: śraddhāyuktena cittena; vast, expanding: pṛthum tiraścā = vast with crooked-going or undulating radiance; vayasā bṛhantam = augmenting with smoke
