## English translation:

“They have genitive rated (**Agni**) when soundly sleeping on his upturned (couch); that Agni who is an embryo in many (vegetable) forms, and who, (rendered manifest) by the oblations, abides conscious in the night, unenveloped by darkness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When soundly sleeping: uttānāyam suṣūtam = on the lower of the two sticks which are rubbed together
