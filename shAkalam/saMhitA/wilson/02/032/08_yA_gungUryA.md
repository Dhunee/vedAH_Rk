## English translation:

“I invoke her who is Gaṅgū, who is **Sinīvālī**, who is **Rākā**, who is **Sarasvatī**; (I invoke) **Indrāṇī** for protection, **Varuṇānī** for welfare.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gaṅgū = **kuhu**, the day of conjunction, when the moon rises invisible; these phases of moon were perhaps, identifiable with Indrāṇī or Varuṇānī, or with both
