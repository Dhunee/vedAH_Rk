## English translation:

“I invoke, with suitable praise, **Rākā**, who is worthily invoked; may she, who is auspicious of good fortune, hear us, and spontaneously understand (our purpose); may she sew her work with an infallible needle; may she grant us excellent and opulent descendants.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May she sew her work: sīvyatu **apaḥ** sūcyācchidyamānayā = may she sew the work with a needle that is not capable of being cut or broken; with one, of which the stitches will endure, in like manner as clothes and th elike wrought with a needle last a long time
