## English translation:

“Wide-hipped **Sinivālī**, who are the sister of the gods, accept the offered oblation, and grant us, goddess, progeny.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 34.10; **Sinīvālī** is the moon on the first day on which it is visible; she is devānām **svasā**, either the sister of the gods, or one who is independent of them;

Pṛthuṣṭuke = **pṛthu** jqaghane; or, pṛthu keśabhare, abundant-haired, or much-praised, or desired of many, ṣṭuka = a head of hair, praise, or desire
