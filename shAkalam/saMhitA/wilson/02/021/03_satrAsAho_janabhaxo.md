## English translation:

“I proclaim the mighty exploits of that **Indra**, who is, ever victorious; the benefactor of man, the overthrower of (the strong) man, the caster down (of foes), the warrior, who is gratified by our libations, the granter of desires, the subduer of enemies, the refuge of the people.”
