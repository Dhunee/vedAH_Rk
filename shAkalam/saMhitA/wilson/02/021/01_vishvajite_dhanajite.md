## English translation:

“Bring the desired **Soma** to the adorable **Indra** the lord of all, the lord of wealth, the lord of heaven, the perpetual lord, the lord of man, the lord of earth, the lord of horses, the lord of cattle, the lord of water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The lord of all: all the terms are compounds with jit = lit. conqueror, as viśvajite, dhanajite, svarjite; but, the sense is best expressed by **adhipati**, lord of or lord over
