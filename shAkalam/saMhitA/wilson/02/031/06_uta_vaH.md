## English translation:

“We desire, gods, to repeat the praise of you, who are propitiated by praise; may **Ahirbudhnya**, Aja ekapād, **Trita**, **Ṛbhukṣin**, **Savitā**, bestow upon us food, and may the swift-moving grandson of the waters, (**Agni**, be gratified by) our praises and our worship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ahirbudhnya and Aja ekapād are two **rudras**;

Ahirbudhnya = ahi, the epithet budhnya implies his origin in the firmament: budhnam antarikṣam tatra bhavo ahi **nāmā** **deva**; aja ekapād is the name of the sun, the unborn, who goes with one foot; trita is an epithet: tritastīrṇatama, most expanded, an epithet of **Indra**; ṛbhukṣin is an appellative of Indra. Savitā = the genitive rator of all, sarvasya prasavitā
