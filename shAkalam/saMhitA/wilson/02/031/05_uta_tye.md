## English translation:

“Or, may the two divine auspicious and mutually contemplating Day and Night, the animators of moving (creatures, urge it on); and, Earth and Heaven, whilst I praise you both with a new hymn, I offer you food of the standing (corn), although provided with the three (sorts of sacrificial) viands.”

I offer you food: sthātuśca **vayas** trivayā upastire = I, who am able to offer you three sorts of sacrificial food, vegetable substances, animal victims, or the **Soma**: oṣadhipaśusomātmakāni annāni; spread, upastṛṇāmi; the food, or cakes and butter, carupuroḍāśādi lakṣaṇāni of that which is stationary, that is, vrīhyādeḥ, or rice and other grains
