## English translation:

“Or, may the divine **Tvaṣṭā**, the defender of the world, together with the wives (of the gods), well plural ased, urge on the chariot; or may Iḷā, the resplendent **Bhaga**, Heaven and Earth, the sagacious **Pūṣan**, and the **Aśvins**, the two husbands (of **Sūryā**), urge on the chariot.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The wives of the gods: the text as gnabhiḥ, with the wives; as accompanying Tvaṣṭā, they are **devapatnīḥ**, wives of the gods, the person nified metres of the **Veda**, according to **Taittirīya**: **chandāṃsi** vai gnaḥ
