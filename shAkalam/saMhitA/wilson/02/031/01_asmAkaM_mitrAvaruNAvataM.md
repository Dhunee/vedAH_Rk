## English translation:

“**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, associated with the **Ādityas**, the **Rudras** and the **Vasus**, protect our (sacrificial) chariot, when (it goes) about (from one plural ce to another); like birds that fly down, seeking for food, rejoicing, and resting in the woods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Protect our sacrificial chariot: asmākam avatam ratham: the cart or wagon to bring food (as mentioned in the next hymn), perhaps, **Soma**, to prepare the libation
