## English translation:

“**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, both be gratified with the sacrifice; hear my invocation as the seated **Hotā** repeats in succession the ancient praises; the (sacrificial) food encompassed (by the priests), attends the royal pair drink, both of you, the sweet **Soma** libation, offered by the Praśāstā.”
