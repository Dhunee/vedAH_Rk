## English translation:

“That (sacrifice) is sufficient for him, (**Indra**), whether (offered) for the first, the second, or the third time; it is the bearer (of good) to man; other (priests) engender the embryo of a different (rite), but this victorious (sacrifice), the showerer (of benefits) combines with other (ceremonies).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For the first: alluding to the three daily sacrifices; with other (ceremonies): anyasyāy, anye, anyebhiḥ, of another, others, with others; the substantives are supplied; anyo **vṛṣā**: indrādibhiḥ devair saṅgacchate, Indra andother deities
