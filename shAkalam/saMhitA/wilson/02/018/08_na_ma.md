## English translation:

“Never may my friendship with **Indra** be disunited; may his liberality (ever) yield us (our desires); may we be within the excellent defence of (his protecting) arms; may we be victorious in every battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Prāye prāye jigīvaṃsaḥ **syāma**: prāye = yuddhe, in war or battle; it also means, entering; may we be victorious in consequence of Indra's repeatedly entering or frequenting the chamber of sacrifice
