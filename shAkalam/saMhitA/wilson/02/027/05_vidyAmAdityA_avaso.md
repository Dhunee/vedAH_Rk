## English translation:

“May I be conscious, **Ādityas**, of this your protection, the cause of happiness (and security) in danger; **Aryaman**, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, may I, through your guidance, escape the sins which are like pitfalls (in my path).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like pitfalls: śvabhreva, śvabhrāṇīva, gartavanti sthalānīva, like plural ces of land having holes or pits
