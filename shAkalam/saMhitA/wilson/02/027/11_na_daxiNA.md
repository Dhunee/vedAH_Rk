## English translation:

“Neither is the right **hand** known to us, **Ādityas**, nor is the left; neither is that which is in front, nor that which is behind, (discerned by me); givers of dwellings, may I, who an immature (in knowledge), and timid (in spirit), obtain, when guided by you, the light that is free from fear.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Either the light of day, or the light of knowledge
