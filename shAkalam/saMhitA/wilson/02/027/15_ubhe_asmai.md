## English translation:

“Both (heaven and earth) combined, cherish him (whom the **Ādityas** protect); verily prosperous, he thrives, with the rain of heaven; victorious in battles, (he defends) both his own dwelling (and assails) that of his foe; to him both portions (of creation) are propitious.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He defends both: ubhā **kṣayā** vājayan **yāti** = liṭ, he goes, conquering, to both habitations; both portions of creation: ubhau ardhau, the two parts of the world; either moveable and immoveable things, or mortal and immortal beings
