## English translation:

“They uphold the **three worlds**, the three heavens, and in their sacrifices three ceremonies (are comprised); by truth, **Ādityas**, has your great might (been produced), such as is most excellent; **Aryaman**, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**. (They uphold the three worlds: tisro bhumir dhārayan: **bhūmi** = **loka**, world, or sphere; earth, firmament, and heaven which the Ādityas support by supplying them with rain; the three heavens: trīḥ dyūn, the three luminous objects, dīptan; the three **lokas** above the sky: **mahar**, **jana**, **satya**; or the three luminous deities: **agni**, **vāyu** and **sūrya**; three ceremonies: trīṇi vratā vidathe antar eṣām = lit. the three ceremonies in the sacrifice, in the midst of them; the three daily ceremonials are essentially one worship of the Ādityas; alternative meaning:in the midst of those worlds, there are three acts intended especially as the acts of the Ādityas, the absorption, retention, and redistribution of dew on rain\].”
