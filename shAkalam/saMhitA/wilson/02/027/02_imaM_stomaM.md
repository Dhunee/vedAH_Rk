## English translation:

“May those of equal exploits, **Mitra**, **Aryaman**, **Varuṇa**, be plural ased today by this my praise; they who are **Ādityas**, luminous, purified by showers, who abandon none (that worship them), who are irreproachable unassailable.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Purified by showers: dhārapūtā, cleansed by water, clean (**nirmala**)
