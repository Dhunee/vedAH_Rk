## English translation:

“The divine **Ādityas** are the upholders (of all things), moveable or immoveable; the protectors of the universe; the provident in acts; the collectors of rain; the possessors of veracity; the acquitters of our debts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The collectors of rain: asuryam rakṣamāṇāḥ: **asurā** = a cloud; from asu = water, as the same with life;

Ra = what yields; hence, asuryam is the water of the cloud, or rain, which the Ādityas keep collected until the season of its full tat tat kāle vṛṣṭyutpādanāya rakṣanti; the acquitter of our debts: the debts are literally so; those which are to be paid by the worshippers to other person ns; ṛṇan stotṛbhiranyebhyaḥ pradeyāni
