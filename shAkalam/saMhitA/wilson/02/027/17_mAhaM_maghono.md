## English translation:

“May I never (have to) represent, **Varuṇa**, the destittution of a (once) opulent, dear, and munificent kinsman; may I never, royal Varuṇa, be devoid of well-regulated riches; (and) may we, blessed with excellent descendants, worthily glorify you at this sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May I never have: māham āvidam śūnam āpeḥ;

Āpeḥ = **jñāti**, a relative;

Śūnam = śūnyam, emptiness;

Dāridryam = poverty;

Explanation: may I not be under the necessity of begging of different princes, saying, my sons, or other relatives are hungry: asmadīyaḥ putrādayaḥ **kṣudhita** iti **prabhu** prabhu samīpe abhidyhāya yācamāno mā bhūvam; may I never, royal Varuṇa: refrain from **sūkta** 15
