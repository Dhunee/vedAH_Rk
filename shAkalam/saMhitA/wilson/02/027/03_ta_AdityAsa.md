## English translation:

“Those **Ādityas**, mighty, profound, unsubdued, subduing, many-eyed, behold the innermost (thoughts of men), whether wicked or virtuous, whether far from or nigh to those royal (deities).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many-eyed: bhūryakṣaḥ = liṭ, having many eyes; figuratively, it implies the universal penetration of the rays of light; or, very brilliant, bahutejasaḥ; behold the innermost (thoughts of men): antahpaśyanti, they look within; i.e. prāṇināmor manuṣyānām hṛtsu, into the hearts of living beings, or men
