## English translation:

“I present continually, with the ladle (of speech), these oblation-dropping hymns to the royal **Ādityas**; may **Mitra**, **Aryaman**, **Bhaga**, the multi-present **Varuṇa**, the powerful **Aṃśa**, hear us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ādityas, sons of **Aditi**: here only five are enumerated. **Taittirīya** adds: **dhātā**, **indra** and **vivasvat** to make the total eight; **aṃśu** (for aṃśa). **Purāṇas** enumerate twelve, adding to the eight of the Taittirīya: **viṣṇu**, **pūṣan**, **tvaṣṭā** and **savitā**).
