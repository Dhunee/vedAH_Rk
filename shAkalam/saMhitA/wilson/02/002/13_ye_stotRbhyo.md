## English translation:

“The pious are they who present, as a gift, to the reciters of your praises, an excellent cow and an elegant horse; do you, **Agni**, lead us and them to the best of abodes, (or heaven), that we and our worthy descendants may repeat the solemn prayer to you at the sacrifice.”
