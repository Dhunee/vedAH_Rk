## English translation:

“They have plural ced him in his solitary dwelling, who is shedding moisture upon the earth; resplendent as gold, traversing the firmament, animate with flames; and pervading the two parents (of all things, heaven and earth), like refreshing water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Resplendent as gold: candram iva surucam = bright-shining,like the moon; **candra**, when neuter, is interpreted as a synonym of gold in the **Veda**
