## English translation:

“The gods have stationed at the root of the world, that **Agni** who is of goodly appearance; the pervader of heaven and earth; who is to be known as a car (to convey men to their wishes); who shines with pure radiance, and who is to be honoured as a friend among mankind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the root of the world: budhne **rajasaḥ** lokasya mūle, i.e. the altar
