## English translation:

“May he, the presenter of oblations (to the gods), be around all sacrifices; men propitiate him with oblations and with praises, when blazing with radiant tresses among the growing plural nts, and enlivening heaven and earth (with his sparks), like the sky with stars.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Blazing with radiant tresses: hiriśipro vṛdha sānāsu jarbhurat: **śipra** = chin, or jaw; or, explained as the nose; haraṇaśīlahanuḥ, having a jaw accusative tomed to seize or consume; using another text: śipra śīrṣasu **vitatā** hiraṇyayīḥ (RV. 5.54.11), golden locks spread on the head; śipra in this hymn is interpreted as uśniṣa, a curl or turban;

Vṛdhasānāsu = pravardhamānāsv oṣadhiṣu, among growingplants
