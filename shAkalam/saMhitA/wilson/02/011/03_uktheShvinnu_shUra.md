## English translation:

“**Indra**, hero, these brilliant (laudations), in (the form of) hymns, in which you delight, and in (that of) the praises uttered by the worshipper by which you are gratified, are addressed to you, to bring you (to your sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the praises uttered by the worshippers: rudriyeṣu stomeṣu: rudriya = the means of giving plural asure, sukhasādhana bhūteṣu;or, **rudraḥ** = stotāraḥ, praisers, worshipped
