## English translation:

“Let those in whom you are delighted repair (to the libation), and do you, **Indra**, confiding, drink the satiating **Soma**; liberator (from evil), associated with the mighty and adorable (**Maruts**), augment our prosperity, and (that of) heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Let those in whom you are: may those Maruts or those Soma, in which you delight; associated with the mighty: asmāntsu pṛtsvā tarutrā avardhayo dyām bṛhadbhir arkaiḥ: pṛtsu qualified avardhaya, increase; i.e. with children, cattle, and the like; in consequence of which prosperous condition, men can offer sacrifices, to heaven to thrive;

Arkaiḥ = arcanīyaiḥ, to be adored (the Maruts)
