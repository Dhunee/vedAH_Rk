## English translation:

“That opulent donation, which proceeds, **Indra**, from you, assuredly bestows upon him who praises you the boon (which he desires); grant it to us, your prisers; do not you, who are the object of adoration, disregard (our prayer); so that, blessed with worthy descendants, we may glorify you at this sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Do not you who are: **māti** dhag bhago no = bhajantyastvam asmākam kāmān mā dhākṣīḥ, you who are adorable, consumenot our desires; bhago no **astu** = may fortune be to us (**Nirukta** 1.7)
