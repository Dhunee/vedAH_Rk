## English translation:

“Invigorated (by the libation) of the exulting **Trita**, offering you the **Soma**, you have annihilated **Arbuda**; **Indra**, aided by the **Aṅgirasa**, has whirled round his bolt, as the tun turns round his wheel, and slain **Bala**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As the sun turns round his wheel: sūryo na cakram; if na is used in the negative sense, the phrase means: when the sun did not turn his wheel or stool still through fear of the **asura**; or, that Indra whirled the wheel like the sun, having taken one of the wheels of the sun's chariot as a weapon against Bala
