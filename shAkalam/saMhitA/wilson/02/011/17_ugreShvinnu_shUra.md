## English translation:

“**Indra**, hero, exulting in the solemn Trikadruka rites quaff the **Soma**, and repeatedly shaking it from your beard, repair, well plural ased with your steeds, to the drinking of the effused libation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trikadruka rites: these denote three days, or celebrations of the ceremonial, termed abhiplava; abhiplavikeṣu ahaḥ su: these are, **jyotiṣ**, gauḥ, **āyus**; the text designates them as ugreṣu, fierce, angry; but here, **ugra** = having many praises and prayers, **bahu** **stotra** śastravat
