## English translation:

“You grant a habitation; you grant friends; you grant us, **Indra**, the strength of the **Maruts**; the winds, who, propitious and exulting, drink copiously of the first offering (of the **Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The winds: **vāyavaḥ** is used honorifically for **vāyu**, in the singular, who is the first drinker of the Soma: vayur hi somasya agrapā
