## English translation:

“**Ādityas**, upholders of pious works, and who are to be sought by all, remove sin far from me, like a woman delivered in secret; knowing, **Mitra**, **Varuṇa** and (universal) gods, the good that follows from your hearing our prayers, I invoke you for (our) protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Delivered in secret: rahasūriva; rahasyanyairajñāte pradeśe sūyata iti rahasūrvabhicāriṇī = like a loose woman who has child privately and who abandons it in some distant plural ce; this comparison is to the distant removal of sin prayed for
