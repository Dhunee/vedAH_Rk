## English translation:

“Thereupon, resplendent, he has overcome Krivi in conflict by his prowess;he has filled heaven and earth (with his lustre), and has been invigorated by the efficacy of the draught; one portion he has taken to himself; the other he has distributed (to the gods); may that divine (**Soma**) pervade the divine (**Indra**), the true Soma, the true (Indra).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Krivi: krivim nāmāsuram, an **asura** so named; one portion he has taken to himself: adhattānyam jaṭhare prem aricyata = lit. he has taken the other in the belly, he has left over that; i.e. (based onthe **Taittirīya**): Indra, having divided the Soma into two portions, took one to himself, and gave the other to the gods; or, a half to Indra, a half to the other gods: etena ardham indrāya, ardham anyebhyo devebhyaḥ
