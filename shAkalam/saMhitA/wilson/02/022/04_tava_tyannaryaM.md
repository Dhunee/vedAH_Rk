## English translation:

“**Indra**, the delighter (of all), the first act performed by you in ancient time was for the good of man, and deserving of renown in heaven, when, arresting by force the breath of the (enemy) of the gods, you did send down the rain; may Indra prevail by his prowess over all that is godless; may **Śatakratu** obtain vigour; may he obtain (sacrificial) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The delighter of all: nṛto = lit. dancer; one who dances of exults in battle; here, it means nartayitrī, one who causes to dance or to rejoice; of the enemy of the gods: the text has only **devasya**, of the divine, or the deity; this is explained as asurasya; asum riṇan = prāṇam himsan, injuring or taking away the breath or life, in consequence of which Indra sends down the water or rain, prāriṇāḥ āpaḥ
