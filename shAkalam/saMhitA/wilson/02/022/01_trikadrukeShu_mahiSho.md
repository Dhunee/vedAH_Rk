## English translation:

“The adorable and powerful (**Indra**), partaking of the **Soma**, mixed with barley, effused at the Tṛkadruka rites, has drunk with **Viṣṇu** as much as he wished; the draught has excited that great and mighty Indra to perform great deeds; may that divine (Soma) pervade the divine (Indra), the true Soma (pervade) the true Indra.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

All the hymns in this **sūkta** occur in the **Sāmaveda**;

**Mahiṣa** = **mahān**, grea, **pūjya**, worshipfult (epithte of Indra); each hymn has a refrain: sa enam saścad devo devam satyam indram **satya** **induḥ**: sa refers to **Indu** or the Soma, of which **deva** as well as satya are epithets; the verb saścat = **vyāpti** **karma**, pervading, in the imperative, vyāpnotu
