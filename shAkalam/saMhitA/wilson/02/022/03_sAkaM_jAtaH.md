## English translation:

“Cognate with (pious) works and with power, you desire to support (the universe); mighty with heroic (energies); you are the subduer of the malevolent; (you are) the distinguisher (between the doer of good and ill); the giver of the substantial wealth he desires to him who praises you; may the divine (**Soma**) pervade the divine (**Indra**), the true Soma, the true (Indra).”
