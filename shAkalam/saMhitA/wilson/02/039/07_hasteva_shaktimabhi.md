## English translation:

“Like two **hands**, **Aśvins**, be ever investing us with vigour; like heaven and earth, bestow upon us rain; give sharpness to the praises that are addressed to you, as they whet an axe upon a grindstone.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kṣṇotreṇa iva svadhitim = asim tejanaśāṇavat tīkṣṇī kurutam, sharpen like a sword or knife upon a whetstone
