## English translation:

“Descend, **Aśvins**, like falling stones, for the purpose (of destroying our foes); hasten to the presence of the wealth-possessing (worshippers), like vultures to a tree; like two **Brāhmaṇas** repeating hymns, (be present) at the sacrifice, and come like (royal) messengers in the land, welcomed by many people.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like two Brāhmaṇas: brahmāṇa iva = brāhmaṇau; this seems to imply a priestly order
