## English translation:

“The gods, intending to dwell (in heaven), left, as a dear friend among the human races, that **Agni**, who, present in the chamber of sacrifice, is bounteous to the donor of offerings, and shines on the nights when he is wished for.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Shines on the nights: dīdayad uśatīrūrmya: uśatīḥ = kāmayamānāḥ, to be desired; ūrmyā **rātriḥ** = nights, all nights or the whole night: sarvāsu rātriṣu dīpyate; or, **sarva** rātrir ādīpayati, he shines on all nights, or he lights up all nights
