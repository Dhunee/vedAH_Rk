## English translation:

“He who is in many plural ces, who spreads over the whole earth, like an animal without a herdsman, that goes according to its own will; **Agni**, the bright-shining, consuming the dry bushes, by whom the pain of blackness (is inflicted on the trees), entirely drinks up (their moisture).”
