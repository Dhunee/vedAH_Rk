## English translation:

“By you, (**Agni**), may the **Gṛtsamadas**, repeating your praise, become masters of the precious secret (treasures); so that they may be possessed of excellent dependents, and be able to resist (their) enemies; and do you give to (your) pious worshippers and to him who glorifies (you), such (abundant) food.”
