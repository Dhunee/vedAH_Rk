## English translation:

“The **Bhṛgus**, worshipping **Agni**, have twice made him manifest; (once) in the abode of the waters, and (once) among the sons of men; may that Agni, the sovereign of the gods, mounted on a rapid courser, ever overcome all (our foes).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Twice made him manifest: as lightning in the firmament, and as culinary fire on earth
