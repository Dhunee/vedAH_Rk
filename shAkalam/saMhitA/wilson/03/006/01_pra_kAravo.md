## English translation:

“Devout ministrants, who are to be inspired by prayer, bring forth (the ladle) destined for the worship of the gods, which is to be conveyed to the south (of the fire-altar), and which, charged with (sacrificial) food, pointed to the east, containing the oblation, and, filled with liquefied butter, proceeds to **Agni**.”
