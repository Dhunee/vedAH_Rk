## English translation:

“With all these in one chariot, **Agni**, or in many (chariots), come to our presence, for your horses are able; bring the three and thirty divinities with their wives, for the sake of (the sacrificial) food, and exhilarate them (all with the **Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three and thirty divinities with their wives: patnīvatas triṃśatam trīṃśca devān: the first is, literally, having wives, but sometimes considered a proper name
