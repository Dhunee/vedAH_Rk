## English translation:

“The great and adorable **Agni** is firm seated on his spacious throne between heaven and earth; and the powerful fellow-brides (of the sun), the imperishable uninjurable (heaven and earth) are the two milk-yielding cows of the wide-extending (Agni).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The fellow-brides: **sapatnī**, the two brides of one; i.e. the sun: **samāna** ekaḥ **sūryaḥ** patiryayoste sapatnyau
