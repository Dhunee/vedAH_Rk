## English translation:

“We meditate on that desirable light of the divine **Savitā**, who influences our pious rites.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 3.35;

**Pracodayāt** = who may animate, or enlighten our intellect;

Savitā = the **soul**, as one with the soul of the world, **Brahma**; when we meditate on the light which is one with Brahma, his own light, which, from its consuming influences on ignorance and its consequences, is termed **Bhargas**, and is that which is desirable, from its being to be known or worshiped by all (vareṇyam) the property of the supreme being, (**parameśvara**), the creator of the world, and the animator, impeller or urger (savitā), through the internally abiding spirit (antaryām) of all creatures; yaḥ, although masculine, may be relative to the neuter noun bhargas, that light which animates all (**dhiyaḥ**) acts (karmāṇi), or illumes all understanding (**buddhiḥ**); again, **devasya** **savituḥ** may mean, of the bright or radiant sun, as the progenitor of all, sarvasya prasavitur, and bhargas may be understood as the sphere or orb of light, the consumer of sins, pāpānām tāpakam tejo maṇḍalam; bhargas may also mean food, and the prayer may only implore the sun to provide sustenance, tasya prasādād annādi lakṣaṇam phalam **dhīmahi** tasya ādhārabhūta bhavema, we anticipate from his favour the reward that is characterized by food and the like, that is, may we be supported by him
