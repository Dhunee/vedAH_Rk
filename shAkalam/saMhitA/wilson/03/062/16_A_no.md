## English translation:

“**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, sprinkle our cow-stalls with butter; performers of good works, (sprinkle) the worlds with honey.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sprinkle the worlds with honey: ghṛtair gavyūtim ukṣatam madhvā rajāṃsi: **gavyūti** = gavām mārgam, or gonivāsasthānam, and the prayer implies, give us cows abounding in milk;

Gavyūti = the path or sacrifice, or a field;

Thṛtaiḥ = pure water, sprinkle our pastures with rain
