## English translation:

“Vigorous, rushing through (hostile hosts), like a war-horse, he has pervaded heaven and earth, sending down rain; he is to be worshipped with oblations at the solemn (rite) like **Bhaga**; he is as the father of those who adore (him); he is beautiful, worthy of invocation, the bestower of food.”
