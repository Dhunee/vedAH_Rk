## English translation:

“Whom, when borne by his steeds, foremost and eminent in battles, breaking in two the (hostile host), no one ever surpasses; supreme in a way, attended by his faithful **Maruts**, and hastening to combat, he has destroyed with foe-withering (energies) the existence of the **Dasyu**.”
