## English translation:

“I glorify the mighty **Indra**, in whom all men, drinking the **Soma**, obtain their wishes; whom the powerful (heaven and earth) and the gods begot, the doer of great deeds, the slayer of the **Vṛtras**, who was fashioned by **Vibhu** (the creator).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Fashioned by Vibha: vibhvataṣṭam = appointed by **Brahma** for the government of the world, jagadādhipatye brahmaṇā sthāpitam
