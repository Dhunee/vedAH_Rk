## English translation:

“The upholder of heaven and of the firmament, the wind, like a chariot traversing the upper (region) accompanied by the **Vasus**; the clother of the night (with gloom), the parent of the sun, the distributor of the portion (allotted to the pious), like the words (of the wealthy appropriating to all) the food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Priṣṭaḥ ūrdhvo ratho na vāyur vasubhir niyutvān: **indra** is also designated here as **vāyu**; the vasus are said to be the **maruts**; another explanation: as, vāyu, having the **niyuts** for his steeds, moves like a chariot on high, so does Indra, accompanied by the Maruts
