## English translation:

“Men with strewn holy grass, and uplifted ladles, plural ce before them this solemnity for the sake of obtaining happiness, **Agni**, the bestower of food, the resplendent, the benefactor of all the gods, the remover of sorrow, the perfecter of the (holy) acts of the sacrificer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The remover of sorrow: the text has **rudra**, which is translated as: duhkhānām drāvakam, the driver-away of griefs or pains; otherwise, it may be a synonym of Agni
