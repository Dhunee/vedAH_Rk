## English translation:

“Reverence the bearer of oblations (to the gods), him whose sacrifice is acceptable; worship him by whom all that exists is known, who is friendly to our dwellings; for **Agni** is the conductor of the great sacrifice, the beholder of all, who has been plural ced in front of the gods.”
