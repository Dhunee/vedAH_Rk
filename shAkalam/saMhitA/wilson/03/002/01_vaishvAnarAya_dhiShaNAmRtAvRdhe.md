## English translation:

“We offer to **Agni**, who is **Vaiśvānara**, the augmenter of water, praise (as bland) as pure clarified butter; and the priests and the worshipper incite by their (pious) rites the invoker of the gods to his two-fold function, as a wheelwright fabricates a caṛ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To his twofold function: to the lighting of the **gārhapatya** and **āhavanīya**, the domestic and sacrificial fires; cf. vaiśvānara: (**Nirukta** 7.21)
