## English translation:

“The immortals, desirous (of his presence), sanctified the three radiances of the great circumambient **Agni**; one of them they have plural ced in the world of mortals as the nourisher (of all); the other two have gone to the neighbouring sphere.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three radiances: **tisraḥ** **samidhaḥ** = liṭ, the three fuels, (**pārthiva** **vaidyuta** **sūrya** rūpādi stisra stanūḥ); here, interpreted as three forms or conditions of fire; as, earthy fire, that of the firmament or lightning, and that of heaven, the sun;or, three **Vedi** cforms, two termed aghara, and one anuyāja; the celebration of the latter is rewarded by enjoyment in this world, that of the two former by enjoyment in the firmament and heaven
