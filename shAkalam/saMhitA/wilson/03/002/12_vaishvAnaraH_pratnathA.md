## English translation:

“Glorified by his adorers, **Vaiśvānara** of old ascended to the heaven that is above the firmament bestowing wealth upon his (present) worshipper, as he did in former times; he travels, ever vigilant, the common path (of the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The common path: thatis, as the sun's path
