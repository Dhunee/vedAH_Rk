## English translation:

“Born (in the forest), and beautified in the sacrifice celebrated by men, it is (again) engendered for the sanctification of the days (of sacred rites); steadfast, active and intelligent (priests) consecrate it with intelligence, and the devout worshipper recites its praise.”
