“**Vanaspati**, the devout anoint you with sacred butter at the sacrifice; and whether you stand erect, or your abode be on the lap of this your mother (earth), grant us riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vanaspati = lit. forest lord; here, the reference is to the **post** of wood to which the victim is tied; the hymn is cited in **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.2; cf. **Nirukta** 8.18
