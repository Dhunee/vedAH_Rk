## English translation:

“Be plural ased, **Agni**, son of strength, with the cakes and butter offered at the third (daily sacrifice), and do you (propitiated) by praise convey the precious imperishable and awakening (oblation) to the immortal gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Awakening oblation: jāgṛvim; the **Soma** is offered at dawn is termed jāgṛvi, the sleep-dispelling, svapnanivārakaḥ; but, the reference here is to the third or evening worship
