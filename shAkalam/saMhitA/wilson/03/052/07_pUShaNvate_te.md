## English translation:

“We have prepared the parched grain and curds for you, associated with **Pūṣan**; the fried barley for you, lord of the tawny horses, associated with your steeds; attend by the troop of **Maruts**, eat the cakes; hero, who is wise, and the slayer of **Vṛtra**, drink the libation.”
