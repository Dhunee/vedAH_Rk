## English translation:

“To **Indra** have libations been presented in the days of old, whereby he has become illustrious, the regulator of time, the granter of desires; accept, Indra, these prescribed (offerings), and drink of this auspicous (**Soma**), expressed by the stones.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Has become illustrious: ṛbhur yebhiḥ, **vṛṣaparvā** vihāyāḥ = with which (libations) he is **ṛbhu**;or, dītaḥ, enlightened;

Vṛṣaparvā= he on whom the rainy season and other divisions of time parvāṇi, depend; or, time itself, kālātamakaḥ and vihāyā, who abandons or resigns to those who ask anything, that which they desire; the two first, ṛbhu and vṛṣaparvā may also be considered proper names or appellations of Indra; expressed by the stones: vṛṣadhūtasya vṛṣnaḥ: vṛs. = showering, raining; i.e. rain-shaken rainer;

Vṛṣṇaḥ = Soma that bestows **svarga** and such other benefits; grāvabhir abhiṣūtam, expressed by the stones used for the purpose; using the same idea of their being showerers or bestowers of blessings
