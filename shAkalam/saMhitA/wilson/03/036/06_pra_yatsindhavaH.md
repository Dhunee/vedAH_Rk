## English translation:

“As the rivers pursue their course, the waters rush to the ocean like the drivers of cars (to a goal), so the vast **Indra** (hastens) from his dwelling (in the firmament), when the humble Som alibation propitiates him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The comparison: as small rivers and scanty waters contribute to the vast ocean, so the **Soma**, however insignificant, contributes to the gratification of the great Indra
