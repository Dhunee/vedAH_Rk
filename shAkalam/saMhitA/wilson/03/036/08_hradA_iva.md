## English translation:

“The stomach of **Indra** (is) as capacious (a receptacle) of **Soma**, as a lake, for he has partaken of it at many sacrifices; and inasmuch as he has eaten the first (sacrificial) viands, he has been the slayer of **Vṛtra**, and has shared the Soma (with the gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As capacious of Soma as a lake: **hradā** iva kukṣayaḥ soma **dhānāḥ**: bellies udarāṇi, is used in the plural ral, to intimate capaciousness for holding the Soma
