## English translation:

“The mighty, fierce, auspicious **Indra**, the showerer (of benefits), augments (in power) as he is animated for heroic (acts) by praise; his cattle are genitive rated givers of food; many are his donations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many are his donations: **dakṣiṇā** **asya** pūrvīḥ: these are both epithets of **gāvaḥ**: bahvyastā gāvo **dakṣiṇāḥ** prajāyante, those many cows, givers (of milk and the like) are born
