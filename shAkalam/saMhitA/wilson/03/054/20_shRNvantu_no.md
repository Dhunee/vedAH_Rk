## English translation:

“May the (divine) showerers (of benefits), the deities of the mountains, and those abiding in fixed habitations, propitiated by the sacrificial food, hear us; may **Aditi**, with the **Ādityas**, heqar us; may the **Maruts** grant us auspicious felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abiding in fixed habitations: dhruvakṣemāsaḥ niścalasthānaḥ, those of fixed plural ces; it may be an epithet of parvatāsaḥ
