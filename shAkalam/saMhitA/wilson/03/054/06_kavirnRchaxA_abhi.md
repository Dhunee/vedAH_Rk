## English translation:

“The far-seeing beholder of mankind (the sun), surveys this heaven and earth, rejoicing when deficient in moisture in the womb of the waters (the firmament), both concurring in community (of function), although they occupy various dwellings, like the diversified nests of a bird.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In community of function: in the interchange of moisture
