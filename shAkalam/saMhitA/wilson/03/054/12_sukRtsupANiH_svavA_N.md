## English translation:

“May the divine **Tvaṣṭā**, the able artificer, the dextrous-handed, the possessor of wealth, the observer of truth, bestow upon us those things (which are necessary) for our preservation; **ṛbhus**, associated with **Pūṣan**, make us joyful, as they (the priests), with uplifted stones, prepare the sacred libation.”
