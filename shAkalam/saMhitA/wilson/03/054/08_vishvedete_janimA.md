## English translation:

“These two keep all born things discrete, and, although comprehending the great divinities, are not distressed; all moving and stationary beings rest upon one (basis), whether animals, or birds, or creatures of various kinds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Keep all born things discrete: heaven and earth all that is born distinct, by furnishing interval or space, avakāśapradānena
