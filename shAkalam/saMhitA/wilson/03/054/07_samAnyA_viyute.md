## English translation:

“Common (in function), disjoined, of distant termination, they remain vigilant in a permanent station; being, as it were, sisters, and ever young; they therefore address each other by twin appellations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Heaven and earth are the person nifications here alluded to; address each other by twin appellations: ādu bruvāte mithunāni **nāma**; heaven and earth are designated together by **urvi** and other duplicate terms: urvyādibhir **dvandva** nāmābhir dyāvāpṛthivyavucyate
