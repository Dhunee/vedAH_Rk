## English translation:

“May **Aryaman**, **Aditi**, the adorable (gods), and the unimpeded functions of **Varuṇa** (protect) us; keep us from (following) the course unpropitious to offspring, and may our dwelling be abundant in progeny and cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Keep us from the course: yuyota no anapatyāni gantoḥ: anapatyāni = putrāṇām ahitāni karmaṇi tanmārgāt **pṛthak** **kuruta**
