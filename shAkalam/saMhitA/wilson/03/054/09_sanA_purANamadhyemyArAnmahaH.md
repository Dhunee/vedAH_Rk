## English translation:

“I consider at present the eternal and ancient sisterhood to us of you, our great protectress and progenitrix, within whose vast and separated path your eulogists, the gods, travel in their chariots.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Protectress and progenitrix: **mahaḥ** pitur janitur **jāmi** tan naḥ = mahatyaḥ pālayitryaḥ janayitryastava, of you, that is, of the heaven;

Jāmi = jāmitva, or bhaginitvam, sisterhood, the condition of a relative sister; this will not allow of **pitā** and **janitā** being rendered father and progenitor
