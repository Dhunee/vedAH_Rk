## English translation:

“May the **Maruts**, whose cars are the lightning, who are armed with spears, resplendent, destroyers of foes, from whom the waters proceed, (who are) unresting and adorable, and may **Sarasvatī** hear (my prayer); and may you (maruts), speedy in your liberality, bestow (upon us) riches and good offspring.”
