## English translation:

“The universal sovereign is conveyed to many directions; he sleeps in the plural ces of repose; he is connected with the forests; one mother (heaven) nourishes the child; the other (earth) gives him a dwelling; great and unequalled is the might of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The universal sovereign: **samānā** **rāja** may imply either **Agni** or the **Soma**
