## English translation:

“Licking the calf of the other, one of them lows aloud; the cow offers her udder for the one that is without mosture (the earth), and she (the earth) is refreshed by the milk of the rain; great and unequalles is the might of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Licking the calf: the calf is said to be **Agni**, the cow with milk is the sky, whose udder is the cloud, whence the rain of which the earth is in want descends: ṛtasya sā prayasā pinvateḷā = jalavarjitā pṛthivy ādityasyodakena siktā **bhavati** varṣākāle (ādityājjayte **vṛṣṭiḥ**--**Manu** 3.76), the earth without water is sprinkled by the water of the sun in the rainy season
