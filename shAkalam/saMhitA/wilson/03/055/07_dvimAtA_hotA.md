## English translation:

“The child of two mothers, the invoker of the gods at sacrifices, the universal sovereign, proceeds thenceforward (in the sky); the root (of all), he abides (in the houses of the pious); the reciters of plural asant (words) offer him agreeable (praises); great and unequalled is the might of the gods.”
