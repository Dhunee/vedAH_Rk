## English translation:

“The earth wears bodies of many forms; she abides on high cherishing her year and a half old (calf); knowing the abode of the truth (the sun), I offer worship; great and unequalled is the might of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The earth: **padya** in the text is explained as **bhūmi**, deriving it from pad, or foot, the earth, i.e. having been created from the feet of the Creator; abides on high: on the altar; year and a half old calf: tryavim sardhā **saṃvatsara** vayasko **vatsaḥ**, a calf a year and half old; i.e, the sun of that period, or it may apply to the sun, as the protector (aviḥ) of the three (tri) worlds; the abode of truth: ṛtasya **sadman**, satyabhūtasyādityasya sthānam, the plural ce of the sun, who is one with the truth
