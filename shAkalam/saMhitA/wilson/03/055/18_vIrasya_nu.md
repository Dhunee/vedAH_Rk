## English translation:

“We proclaim, people, the wealth of the hero, (**Indra**), in horses; the gods know his (affluence); six, or five and five, harnessed to his car, convey him; great and unequalled is the might of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Six or five: ṣoḷhā **yuktāḥ** pañcapañca vahanti = either the six seasons of the year, or, by combining the cold and dewy seasons, five; these are figurately Indra's horses.
