## English translation:

“The child of two mothers sleeps in the west, but (in the morning) the single infant proceeds unobstructed (through the sky); these are the functions of **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**; great and unequalled is the might of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mitra and Varuṇa: Mitra presiding over day; Varuṇa over the night, both being forms of one **Agni**
