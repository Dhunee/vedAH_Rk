## English translation:

“This lowly-minded **Indra** has created the wide-spread, commingled, all-delighting waters; and they, purifying the sweet (libations) with the sage purifiers, and being benevolent (to all), proceed with (the revolutions) of days and nights.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With the sage purifiers: kavibhiḥ pavitraiḥ = the sages, who are as it were with the filters or purifiers of the **soma**, are the divinities: **agni**, **vāyu** and **sūrya**; proceed with days and nights: dyubhir-hinvantyuktabhiḥ = they go with days and nights, i.e. they regulate by day and night the respective functions of all the world: rātridivam saravam **jagat** sva svavyāparapravanam kurvanti, they make the whole world diligent in its respective functions by night and day
