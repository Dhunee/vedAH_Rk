## English translation:

“The seven intelligent ages (the **aṅgirasas**) having ascertained that (the cows) were concealed in the strong (cavern), propitiated (**Indra**) by mental devotion; they recovered them all by the path of sacrifice; for Indra, knowing (their pious acts), and offering them homage, entered (the cave).”
