## English translation:

“May he who is the type of all that is excellent the anticipator (of his foes), he who knows all that is born, who destroys **Śuṣṇa**, the far-seeing, the restorer of cattle may he, a friend coming from heaven, honouring us as his friends, be free from all reproach.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Far-seeing: **padavīḥ**, kavitama, most wise or far-seeing as to the past, from **pada**, on object, and viḥ, who knows; may he be free from all reproach: muñcanniravadyāt: always, nitarām, be free, muñcatu-- from such a fault as that of the nature of the death of **Vṛtra**: vṛtravadharūpād doṣāt; the **paurāṇika** notion is that Vṛtra was a **brahman**, and by killing him, **Indra** was guilty of the heinous sin of **brahmahatyā**
