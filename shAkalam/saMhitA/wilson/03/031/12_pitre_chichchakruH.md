## English translation:

“They (the **aṅgirasas**) performing pious acts made for their protector a spacious and splendid abode which they celebrated; seated (at the sacrifice) and supporting with the pillar (of the firmament) the parents (of all things heaven and earth), they established the rapid **Indra** on high (in heaven).”
