## English translation:

“(A son) born of the body, does not transfer (paternal) wealth to a sister; he has made (her) the recptacle of the embryo of the husband; if the parents procreate children (of either sex), one is the performer of holy acts, the other is to be enriched (with gifts).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Born of the body: **tānvaḥ** = tanujaḥ na jāmaye riktham āraik, if there be a son the inheritance does not go to the sister, jāmaye, bhaginyai; he has made her the receptacle: and by so doing he makes her sanskṛta-- he secures for her one of the essential purificatory rites; if the parents procreate children: yadi mātaro janayanti vahnim: **vahni** = offspring, or **male** offspring, a son;

Avahni = a daughter; one, the son, the performer of obsequial and other rites, is the heir, while the other is rindhan, ridhyamāna, to be increased or made wealthy, with dresses, ornaments and the like; cf. **Nirukta** 3.4-6
