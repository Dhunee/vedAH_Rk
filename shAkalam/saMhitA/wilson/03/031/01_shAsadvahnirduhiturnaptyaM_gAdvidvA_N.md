## English translation:

“The sonless father, regulating (the contract), refers to his grandson, (the son) of his daughter, and relying on the efficiency of the rite, honours (his son-in-law) with valuable gifts; the father, trusting to the impregnation of the daughter, supports himself with a tranquil mind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sonless father: śāsadvahniḥ; the latter is said to be the father of a daughter only, not of a son, because he conveys away (vahati, prāpayati) his property through his married daughter into another family; śāsad, śāsti, he stipulates, that this daughter's son, his grandson, duhitur naptyam, shall be his son, a mode of affiliation recognized by law; and relying on an heir thus obtained, and one who can perform his funeral rites, he is satisfied
