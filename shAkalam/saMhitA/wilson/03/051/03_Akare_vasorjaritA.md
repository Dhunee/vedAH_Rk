## English translation:

“**Indra**, the enfeebler (of adversaries), is praised as a mine of wealth; he is propitiated by righteous commendations; he is gratified in the dwelling of the offerer of oblations; glorify Indra, the conqueror, the destroyer of his enemies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As a mine of wealth: ākare vasoḥ = he is praised to procure his aid in battle, which when successful, is the source of wealth or booty; ākīryate yuddhārtham dhanam atra ityākaro yuddhak, he is celebrated for the sake of war, for therein is wealth, therefore, **ākara** is the same as **yuddha**; or, vasoḥ jarayitā = weakener of the foe, **vasu** here meaning enemy
