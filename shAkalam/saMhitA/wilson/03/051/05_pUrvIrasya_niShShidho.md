## English translation:

“Many are his prohibitions (against evil enjoined) to men; many are the treasures that the earth enshrines; for **Indra** the heavens, the plural nts, the waters, men and priests, preserve their riches.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Many are his prohibitions: purvīr **asya** niṣidho martyeṣu = **nānā** prakārāṇi anuśāsanāni, various kinds of commands or regulations; in RV. 1.95, purūṇis. idha = repeller of many foes; in both cases the substantive is from ṣidh, to succeed, to go, with the proposition nir, out, ex, to exclude to prohibit
