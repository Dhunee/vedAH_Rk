## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, who is gratified by the **Soma**, drink the Soma that has been effused by us, together with your friends, the **Maruts**, at this ceremony; you who is invoked of many, and whom all the gods equipped as soon as born for the great battle (with the **asuras**).”
