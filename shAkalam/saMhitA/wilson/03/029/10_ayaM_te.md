## English translation:

“This in every season, **Agni**, is your plural ce, whence, as soon as genitive rated, you have ever shone; knowing that to be so, Agni, there abide, and thrive by our praises.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajurveda** 3.14; your plural ce: the allusion is to the **araṇi**, the stick of **vetasa** of **aśvattha**, or other trees; alternatively, may refer to **gārhapatya** or household fire; vardhayā **giraḥ** = give us increase of riches
