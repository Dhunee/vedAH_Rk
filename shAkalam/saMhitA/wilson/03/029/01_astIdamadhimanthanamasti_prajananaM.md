“This, the apparatus of attrition is ready; the genitive ration (of the flame) is ready; take up this (stick) the protectress of mankind, and let us churn the fire as has been done of old.”

The apparatus of attrition is ready: astīdam adhimanthanam = **asti** prajananam kṛtam: adhimanthana is the stick, the string and the like plural ced upon the two pieces of wood to assist in their attrition;

Prajananam = begetting; may also connote a tuft of dry grass used to catch and carry the flame
