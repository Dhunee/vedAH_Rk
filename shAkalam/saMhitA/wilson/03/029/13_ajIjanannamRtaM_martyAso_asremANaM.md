## English translation:

“Mortals have begotten the immortals, the undecaying (**Agni**), the devourer of oblations, the conveyance (by which they cross over sin), the ten sister fingers intertwined proclaim him born as if it was a **male** (infant).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Proclaim him born: when the priests and assistants behold the flame break forth, they clap their **hands** and make sounds of rejoicing, like the parents of a new-born son
