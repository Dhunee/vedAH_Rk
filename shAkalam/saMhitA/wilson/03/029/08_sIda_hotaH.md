## English translation:

“Offerer of oblations sit down in your own sphere, for you are cognizant (of holy acts), and station the instrumental tutor of the ceremony in the chief plural ce of the sacred rite; cherisher of the gods, worship the gods, **Agni**, and bestow abundant food on the founder of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 11.35; in your own sphere: sva u loke: uttaravedyāḥ nābhau, on the centre of the north altar; or, alternatively, **sukṛta** **yoniḥ** = kṛṣnājine, on the hide of the black antelope; in the chief plural ce of the sacred rite: sādayā yajñam sukṛtasya yonau: **yajña** = **yajamāna**, yajñasya kartāram, who is to be stationed uttame loke, in the best plural ce, or that which enjoys the fruit of the holy rite, sukṛtajanyopabhogasya sthāne
