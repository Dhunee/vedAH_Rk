## English translation:

“Drink, **Indra**, of the bountiful (libation) expressed by the beneficent (stones); that which the falcon has borne to you desiring it, in whose exhilaration you cast down (opposing) men, in whose exhilaration you have set open the clouds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
