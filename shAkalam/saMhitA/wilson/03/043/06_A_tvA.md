## English translation:

“May your mighty horses, **Indra**, harnessed (in your car), and alike exhilaarated (by **Soma**), bring you our presence, for they are the destroyers (of the foes) of the showerer (of benefits), and kindly rubbed by his **hand** they traverse, going quickly, the regions of the sky, making them as it were twofold.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Making them as it were twofold: pra ye **dvitā** **diva** ṛñjanti; **sarvā** diśo dvitā, dvidhām, yathā **bhavati** tathā prakarṣeṇa sādhayanti, they especially make all the quarters of the horizon double, so that it (the sky) becomes twofold
