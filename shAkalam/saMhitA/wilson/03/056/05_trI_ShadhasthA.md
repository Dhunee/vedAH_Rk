## English translation:

“Rivers, the dwelling-plural ces of the intelligent gods are thrice three; the measurer of the three (worlds) is the sovereign at sacrifices; three feminine le (divinities) of the waters charged with the rains descend from heaven at the thrice (repeated) solemnity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Each of the three **lokas** has three divisions; this information is addressed to the river, **Sindhavaḥ** being in the vocative case; the measurer of the **three worlds**: the sun or the year; three feminine le divinities: iḷā, **sarasvatī** and **bhāratī**
