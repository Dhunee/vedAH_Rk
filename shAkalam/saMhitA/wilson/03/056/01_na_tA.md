## English translation:

“Neither the deceptive nor the resolute interrupt the primitive and permanent operations of the gods, nor do the innocuous heaven and earth (interrupt them), nor are the mountains standing (on the earth) to be bowed down.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The condition of all created things in earth and heaven, and the elevation of the mountains, are the work of the gods, and no one can make them otherwise
