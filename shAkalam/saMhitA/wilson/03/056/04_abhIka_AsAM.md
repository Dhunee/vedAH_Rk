## English translation:

“(The year) is awake, the path in the vicinity of those (plural nts); I call upon the beautiful name of the **Ādityas**; the divine waters wandering severally (now) give it delight, and (now) depart from it.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ādityas: that is, upon the months over which the twelve Ādityas preside; now give it delight and now depart from it: during the four months of the year when the rains fall the rivers are filled; during the other eight they are more or less dried up
