## English translation:

“The tree-breasted, the showerer (of rain), the omniform, the three-uddered, the parent of multiform progeny, the possessor of magnitude, followed by three hosts (the year), advances, the vigorous impregnator of the perpetual plural nts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three-breasted: thatis, as subsequently specified, the year, person nified; the number three, repeatedly mentioned, is said to apply to the seasons of the year, reduced from the usual number of six to three, the hot, rainy, and cold, by merging into them, severally, the vernal, autumnal, and dewy.
