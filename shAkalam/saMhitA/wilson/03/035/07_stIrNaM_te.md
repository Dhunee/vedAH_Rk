## English translation:

“The sacred grass is strewn for you; the **Soma**, **Indra**, is poured forth; the grain wherewith to feed your horses is prepared; the oblations are offered to you abiding on the sacred grass, who is praised of many, and is the showerer (of benefits), attended by the **Maruts**.”
