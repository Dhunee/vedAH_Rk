## English translation:

“The leaders (of the ceremony) have prepared for you, **Indra**, this (libation), sweetened with milk, the stones, the water; beautiful Indra, who is favourably disposed, and who is wise, knowing well (the worship) that is according to your peculiar paths, come and drink of this libation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Knowing well the worship: prajānan **pathyā** anu svāḥ = righty apprehending the praises which are due or peculiar, and which are offered with the rites enjoined by the **Vedas**.
