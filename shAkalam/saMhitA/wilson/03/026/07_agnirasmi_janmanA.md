## English translation:

“I, **Agni**, am by birth endowed with knowledge of all that exists; clarified butter is my eye; ambrosia is my mouth; I am the living breath of threefold nature, the measure of the firmament, eternal warmth; I am also the oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 18.66; I, Agni, am by birth: agni asmi janmanā jātavedā; clarified butter is my eye: a mystical description of the universality of Agni in the double capacity of the enjoyer and enjoyed, the food and the feeder, and in the three forms of fire, air, and the sun, presiding over earth, mid-heaven, and heaven; the eye of Agni is the light of all, which light is fed by oblations of butter; ambrosia is the reward of pious acts or enjoyment of heaven and the like, which is procurable through oblations to fire, as if through his mouth or countenance, **amṛtam** me **āsan**;

Arkastridhātū: **arka** = jagatsraṣṭā **prāṇaḥ**, world-creating vital air, which, becoming threefold is **vāyu**, in the firmament, agni, on earth and **āditya** as the source of eternal warmth and life. (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 10.6.5). Another interpretation: as the eye lights up the world, so ghī thrown upon the fire causes it ot burn fiercer and dispense more light;

**Amṛta** = **prabhā**, light, light is in my countenance;

Tridhāt = the three vital airs termed **prāṇa**, **apāna** and **vyāna**; the identity with the air and the sun is similarly explained. Yet another interpretation: It is the **yajamāna** who identifies himself with Agni, saying, I am by birth, Agni, or of this form of Agni, **Agni-rūpa**, the lord of all that is born, the sacrifice (arka), the three **vedas**, the measure of the water, the eternal sun; ghī is the eye; i.e., I behold the offerer of ghī on the fire; I convert the oblation that is put into my mouth into ambrosia; thus there is no duality between Agni and the individual, evamātmānyagnyādvaitam
