## English translation:

“Heaven and earth be kind to that stage who is as it were a many-cahnneled and inexhaustible stream (of knowledge); the parent (of his disciples), the collater of holy texts, rejoicing on the lap of his parents,, whose words are truth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That sage: That is, **Viśvāmitra** himself; in consequence of his discovery that **vaiśvānara** is **para-brahma** the **supreme spirit**; perhaps, this hymn may be ascribed to **Brahma**
