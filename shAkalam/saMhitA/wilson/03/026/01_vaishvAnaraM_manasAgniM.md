## English translation:

“We of the race of **Kuśika** offering oblations, desirous of wealth, having contemplated him in our minds, invoke with praises the divine **Vaiśvānara**, the observer of truth, the cognizant of heaven, the bountiful, the charioteer, the frequenter (of sacrifices).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Observer of truth: anusatyā: from anu and **satya**; the notion is not that of observing truth in the abstract, but of keeping faith with the sacrificer, by giving him the desired recompense to which he is justly entitled
