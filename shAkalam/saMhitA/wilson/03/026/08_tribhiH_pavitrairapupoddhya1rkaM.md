## English translation:

“**Agni**, thoroughly comprehending the light that is to be understod by the heart, has purified himself (by the three) purifying (forms); he has made himself most excellent treasure by (these) self-manifestations, and has thence contemplated heaven and earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Having by self-contemplation recognized his identity with the three manifestations, Agni, **Vāyu** and **Āditya**, he comes to know his identity with the universe, as by the text, ātmani vijñāte sarvam idam vijñātam **bhavati**, the self being known, all this (universe) is known
