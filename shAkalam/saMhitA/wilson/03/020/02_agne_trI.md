## English translation:

“**Agni**, born of sacrifice, three are your viands; three your abiding plural ces, three the tongue satisfying (thegods); three verily are your forms acceptable to the deities, and with them never heedless (of our wishes), bepropitious to our praises.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three viands: butter, fuel and the **Soma**; three abiding plural ces: three altars, or the three daily sacrifices, or the **three worlds**; three tongues: three fires, **gārhapatya**, **āhavanīya** and **dakṣiṇā**; three forms: three fires termed **pāvaka**, **pavamāna** and **śuci**
