## English translation:

“The bearer (of the oblation) invokes with praises at the break of day, **Agni**, the dawn, the **Aśvins**, and Dadhikra); may the resplendent divinities, desirous of our sacrifice, hear in unison (the invocation).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dadhikrā = ordinarily means a horse; here, it implies a divinity: **dadhikrāva** **nāma** kaścidevaḥ tam dadhikāvaṇam
