## English translation:

“The (rays) of the blackbacked, all-sustaining (**Agni**) have arisen, and pervaded the parents (earth and heaven) and the flowing rivers; the surrounding parents co-operate with him, and bestow long life for the sake of assiduous worship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śitipṛṣṭhasya dhāseḥ: agni is implied; so is raśmayaḥ, rays;

Dhāsi = sarvasya dhārayitā; sapta **vāṇīḥ** = sarpaṇasvabhāvā **nadīḥ**
