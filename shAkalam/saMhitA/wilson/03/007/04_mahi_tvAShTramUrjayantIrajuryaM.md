## English translation:

“The flowing (rivers) invigorating him, bear along the great son of **Tvaṣṭā**, the undecaying upholder (of the world), radiant with various forms in the vicinity (of the firmament); **Agni** is associated with heaven and earth, as (a husband with) one only wife.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

One only wife: the text has ekām iva, like one, the pronoun being feminine nine; the additions are: yathā **pumān** ekām praviśati, as a man cohabits with one woman
