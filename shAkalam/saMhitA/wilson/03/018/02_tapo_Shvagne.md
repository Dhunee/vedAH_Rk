## English translation:

“Vex thoroughly, **Agni**, our assailing enemies, disappoint the purpose of the adversary who offers not worship; giver of dwellings, who are cognizant (of sacred rites), vex those who have no thought (of pious acts) so that your undecaying, all-pervading (rays), may ever abide.”
