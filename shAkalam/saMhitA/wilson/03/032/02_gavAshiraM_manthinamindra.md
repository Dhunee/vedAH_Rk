## English translation:

“**Indra**, drink the **Soma** mixed with milk, with butter-milk, or fresh; we offer it for your exhilaration, associated with the devout company of the **Maruts** and the **Rudras**; drink it till you are satisfied.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mixed with milk: gavaśiram, manthinam, śukram: manthinam = manthasaṃyuktam, mixed with butter-milk;

Śukram = abhinavan, new or fresh; or, the terms may mean śukramanthigrahe vartamānam, being in the vessel of acid butter-milk;

Devout: brahmakṛtā = indrastotram kurvāṇena, making the praise of Indra
