## English translation:

“When the thought of glorifying **Indra** entered my mind, then I gave birth (to his praises); may I laud him before encountering distant (evil) days, whereby he may guide us beyond sin; for those on both sides of us invoke him, as (those on either bank of a river hail) a passenger in a boat.”
