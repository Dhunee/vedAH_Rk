## English translation:

“Phased with the sacrifice, as if it was that of **Manu**, drink, **Indra**, the **Soma**, for the sake of perpetual vigour; come, lord of the tawny steeds, with the adorable **Maruts**, and with the traversers (of the air); send down the waters (of the firmament) to (blend with) the waters of the earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Send down the waters: apo **arṇā** sisaṛsi = antarikṣasthitān yudakāni pārthivān yudakāni, prāpaya, cause the waters staying in mid-air to reach, or become those of, earth
