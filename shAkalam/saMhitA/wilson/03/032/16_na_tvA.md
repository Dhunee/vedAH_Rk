## English translation:

“Invoked of many, the deep ocean arrests you not, nor do the accompanying mountains (stay you); and therefore, summoned by your friends, you have repressed the strong flame abiding in the abyss.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You have repressed the strong flame: dṛḷham cid arujo gavyam ūrvam = prabalam api avate vartamānam ūrvānalam samyagabhāṅkṣīḥ, you have entirely broken the strong (**ūrva**) fire abiding in the deep
