## English translation:

“**Indra**, the praised of many, associated with **Ṛbhu**, and with **Vāja**, exult with **Śaci**, at this our sacrifice; these self-revolving (days) are devoted to you, as well as the ceremonies (addressed) to the gods, and the virtuous acts of man.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śaci = **karman**, act, rite
