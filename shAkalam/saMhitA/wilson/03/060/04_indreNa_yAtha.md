## English translation:

“Go with **Indra** in his chariot when the libation is poured out, and be (welcomed) with honour by the (worshipper) desiring (your favour); **ṛbhus**, sons of **Sudhanvan**, bestowers (of the rewards of pious acts), your virtuous deeds, your great faculties, arenot to be mesured.”
