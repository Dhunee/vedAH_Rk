## English translation:

“The **ṛbhus**, the performers of (good) works, the grandsons of a man, have attained the friendship of **Indra**, they have perpetuated (existence); the sons of **Sudhanvan** have attained immortality; performers of pious acts influencing (the result), through their devotion (they have attained divinity) by their works.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Perpetuated: dadhanvire (as in adhārayanta, RV. 1.202) has no accusative ative; so, aded is: prāṇam, vitality, meaning immortal life
