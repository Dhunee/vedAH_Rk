## English translation:

“**Indra**, with the food-bestowing **Ṛbhus** rewarding (worship) with food, come hither to (receive) the reverential praise of the adorer, with a hundred quick-going steeds, the indications (of the **Maruts**); come to the burnt offering of the sacrifice, yielding a thousand blessings to the sacrificer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Food-bestowing Ṛbhus: Ṛbhubhir vājibhir vājayan, imples a quibble on the word **vāja**: which is the name of one of the Ṛbhus, used for all the Ṛbhus; it also means, food
