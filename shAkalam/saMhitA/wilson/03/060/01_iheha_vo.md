## English translation:

“Your connection (with the consequences of acts) **ṛbhus** is here (acknowledged) by the minds of all; desiring their share (of the sacrifice), oḥ men, they have come with a knowledge (of their claims) to these (rites); the sons of **Sudhanvan**, with the devices by which they are victorious over foes, you have accepted the share of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your connection: vo bandhutā = your affinity or friendship; i.e. they who connect acts with their fruits, badhnanti phalena karmāṇi; you have accepted the share of the sacrifice: yajñiyam bhāgam **ānaśa**: the verb is explained in the second person plural of the reduplicate preterite, yūyam **vyāptaḥ** **stha**, you have pervaded, the as' is conjugated in **parasmaipada**, instrumental ad of **ātmanepada**; in the third stanza we have samānaśuḥ instrumental ad of samānaśire
