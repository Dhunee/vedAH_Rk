## English translation:

“The righteous (**Agni**) when first kindled on the several (altars) the object of adoration by all, whose hair is flame, and who is cleansed with butter, the purifier, the worthy-worshipped, is sprinkled with oblations for the worship of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The righteous Agni: prathamānudharmā: **dharma** is a synonym of agni; or, the construction may be anudharma, according to law or religion
