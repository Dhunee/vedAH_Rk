## English translation:

“Three are your existences **Jātavedas**; three, **Agni**, are your parent dawns; with them offer the oblation of the gods, the knowing (his wishes) be the bestower of happiness on the instrumental tutor of the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three existences: trīṇyāyuṃsi, three lives, as supported by butter, by fuel and the **Soma**; parent dawns: **tisra** agnīruṣasaḥ: ājānī may mean sisters, or mothers; the dawns person nified as the parents or sisters of Agni, as prior or subsequent to the lighting of the sacrificial fire in the early morning; 'three' may relate to three diurnal fires; as sisters, separate offices are assigned to them: prajām ekā rakṣaty ūrjam ekā, rāṣṭram ekā rakṣati, one preserves the people, one vigour, one the kingdom
