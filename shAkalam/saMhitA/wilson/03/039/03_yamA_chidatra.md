## English translation:

“The parent of twins (the dawn), has brought forth the twin (**Aśvins**) on this occasion, (in the praise of whom) the tip of my tongue remains tremulous; they two, the dispersers of darkness, combine, assuming bodies as a pair (of twins) at the origin of the day.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the origin of the day: the aśvins are worshipped at the morning ceremony
