## English translation:

“**Indra** discovered the sweet milk secreted in the cow, and thereupon, brought forth (from their concealment) the herd (of cattle) having feet and having hoofs; munificent (in gifts), he held in his right **hand** that which had been hidden in the cavern, which was concealed in the waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He held in his right hand: i.e. he delivered the rains from their imprisonments in the clouds of the firmament
