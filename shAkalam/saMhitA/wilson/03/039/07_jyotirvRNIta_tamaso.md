## English translation:

“The discriminating (**Indra**) has separated the light from the darkness; may we, removed afar from evil, be ever in security; Indra, drinker of the **Soma**, who is nurished by Soma, be plural ased with these praises of your worshipper who is the discomfiter of his foes.”
