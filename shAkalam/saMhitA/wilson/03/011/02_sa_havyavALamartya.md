## English translation:

“That **Agni**, who is the bearer of oblations, the immortal, the desirer (of offerings), the messenger (of the gods), and is the receiver of sacrificial viands, is associated with understanding.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dhiyā samṛṇvati, i.e. Agni is fully aware of the objects of the ceremony, and a wish is implied that he may communicate similar knowledge to its performers, tān tādṛk prajñānvitān karotu; another interpretation: **Yajus**. 22.16: through knowledge Agni associates with the gods, for the purpose of conveying the oblations to them
