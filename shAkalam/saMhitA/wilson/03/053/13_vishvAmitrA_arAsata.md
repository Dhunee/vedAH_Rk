## English translation:

“The **Viśvāmitras** have addressed the prayer to **Indra**, the wielder of the thunderbolt; may he therefore render us very opulent.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Viśvāmitras: The **bharatas**, or descendants of **Bharata**, are descendants of **Viśvāmitra**; Bharata is the son of **Śakuntalā**, the daughter of the sage, **Visvāmitra** (**Mahābhārata** **Ādiparva**); **Vasiṣṭha** is the family priest of the Bharats and was the restorer to dominion from which they had been expelled by the **Pañcālas**
