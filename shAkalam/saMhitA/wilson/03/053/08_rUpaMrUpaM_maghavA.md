## English translation:

“**Maghavan** becomes repeatedly (manifest) in various forms, practising delusions with respect to his own peculiar person n; and invoked by his appropriate prayers, he comes in a moment from heaven to the three (daily rites), and, although observant of seasons, is the drinker (of the **Soma**) irrespective of season.”
