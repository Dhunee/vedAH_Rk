## English translation:

“Approach, **Kuśikas**, the steed of **Sudās**; animate (him), and let him loose to (win) riches (for the **raja**); for the king (of the gods) has slain **Vṛtra** in the East, in the West, in the North, therefore let (Sudās) worship him in the best (regions) of the earth.”
