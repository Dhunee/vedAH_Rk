## English translation:

“Fix firmly the substance of the khayar (axle), give solidity to the **śiśu** (floor) of the car; strong axle, strongly fixed by us, be strong; cast us not from out of our conveyance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Khayar and śiśu: khadirasya sāram is the text;

**Khadira** = mimosa catechu of which the bolt of the axle is made; while the **śiṃśapa**, dalbergia **sisu** furnishes wood for the floor; these are still timber-trees in common use
