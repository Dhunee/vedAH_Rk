## English translation:

“As (the tree) suffers pain from the axe, as the śimbal flower is (easily) cut off, as the injured cauldron leaking scatters foam, so may mine enemy perish.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ellipse: as the tree is cut down by the axe, so may the enemy be cut down; as one cuts off without difficulty the flower of the śimbal, so may he be destroyed; as the **ukhā** (cauldron) when struck (prahata), and thence leaking (yeṣantī, sravantī), scatters foam or breath from its mouth, so (**dveṣṭa** madīya, **mantra** sāmarthyena prahataḥ san, phenam mukhād udgirtu), may that hater, struck by the power of my prayer vomit foam fromhis mouth
