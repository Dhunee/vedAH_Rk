## English translation:

“Men, (the might) of the destroyer is not known toyou; regarding him as a mere animal, they lead him away desirous (silently to complete his devotions); the wise condescend not to turn the foolish into ridicule, they do not lead the ass before the horse.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend: **Viśvāmitra** was seized and bound by the followers of **Vasiṣṭha**, when observing a vow of silence. These were the reflections of the sage on the occasion: disparaging the rivalry of Vasiṣṭha with himself, as if between an ass and a horse: sāyakasya = of an arrow;here explained, to destroy, avasānakāriṇaḥ; lodham nayanti = they lead the sage;

Lodha = from lubdham, desirous that his penance might not be frustrated, **tapasaḥ** kṣayo mā bhūd iti, lobhena tuṣṇīm sthitam ṛṣim paśum manyamāna, thinking the ṛṣi silent through his desire, to be an animal, i.e., stupid; another interpretation in **Nirukta**:lubdham ṛṣim nayanti paśum manyamānaḥ, they take away the desiring ṛṣi, thinking him an animal; na avājinam vājinā hāsayanti: **vājina** = from vac, speed, with ina affix; interpreted as srvajña, all knowing; the contrary avajina = **mūrkha**, a fool
