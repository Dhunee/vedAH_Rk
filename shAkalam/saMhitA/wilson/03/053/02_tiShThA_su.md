## English translation:

“Tarry a while contentedly, **Maghavan** (at our rite); go not away; for I offer to you (the libation) of the copiously-effused **Soma**; powerful **Indra**, I lay hold of the skirts (of your robe) with sweet-flavoured commendations, as a son (clings to the garment) of a father.”
