## English translation:

“May she, gliding everywhere, quickly bring us food (suited) to the five races of men; may she, the daughter of the sun whom the grey-haired **jamadagnis** gave to me, (be) the bestower of new life.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Five races of men: pañcajanyāsu kṛṣṭiṣu: five distinctions are restricted to human beings; hence, the reference may be to four castes and barbarians; daughter of the sun: pakṣyā, the daughter of **Pakṣa**: pakṣa nirvāhakasya, the distributor of the parts (of the year?), i.e. sūryasya, of the sun; bestower of new life: navyam āyur dadhāna, having new life or food: mama kurvaṇā bhavatu
