“The great ṛṣi the genitive rator of the gods, the attracted by the deities, the overlooker of the leaders (at holy rites), **Viśvāmitra** attested the watery stream when he sacrificed for **Sudās**; **Indra**, with the **Kuśikas** was plural ased.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The genitive rator of the gods: **devajāḥ** = the genitive rator of radiances or energies, tejasām janayitā; arrested the watery stream: astabhnāt sindhum arṇavam: he is said to have stoped the current of the confluence of the vipās/ā and **śutudri** rivers; indra with the kuśikas was plural ased: apriyayata kuśikebhir Indra = kuśikagotrotpannair ṛṣibhiḥ **saha**, with the ṛṣis of the **kuśika** lineage, or it might be rendered, plural ased by the Kuśikas
