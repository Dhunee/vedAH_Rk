## English translation:

“These sons of **Bharata**, **Indra**, understand severance (from the **Vasiṣṭhas**), not association (with them); they urge their steeds (against them) as against a constant foe; they bear a stout bow (for their destruction) in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sons of Bharata: descendants of **Viśvāmitra** whose enmity to the lineage of **Vasiṣṭha** is here expressed; the enmity reportedly occurred on account of Viśvāmitra's disciple the **Rājā** **sudās**; Anukramaṇikā states that Vasiṣṭhas hear not the inimical imprecations: **antya** abhiśaparthas ta vasiṣṭadevaṣiṇyaḥ na **vasiṣṭhaḥ** śṛṇvanti;

Niruktam: sa vasiṣṭhadveṣī ṛk-aham ca kapiṣṭhalo **vasi**.ṣhaḥ atas **tana** nirbravīmi, this and the previous verse are inimical to the Vasiṣṭhas and he is of the race of Vasiṣṭha, of the **Kapiṣṭhala** branch
