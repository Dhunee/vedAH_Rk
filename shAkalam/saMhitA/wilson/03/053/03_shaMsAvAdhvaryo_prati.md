## English translation:

“**Adhvaryu**, let us two offer praise; do you concur with me; let us address plural asing praise to **Indra**; sit down, Indra, on the sacred grass (prepared by) the instrumental tutor of the rite; and may our commendations be most acceptable to Indra.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Do you concur with me: **prati** me gṛṇīhi; the **Hotā** is supposed to speak to Adhvaryu to direct their joint performance of some part of the ceremony
