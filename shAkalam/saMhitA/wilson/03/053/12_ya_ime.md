## English translation:

“I have made **Indra** glorified by these two, heaven and earth, and this prayer of **Viśvāmitra** protects the race of **Bharata**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Made Indra glorified: indram atuṣṭavam-- the verb is the third preterite of the casual, I have caused to be praised; it may mean: I praise Indra, abiding between heaven and earth, i.e. in the firmament
