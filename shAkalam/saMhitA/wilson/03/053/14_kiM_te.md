## English translation:

“What do the cattle for you among the **Kīkaṭas**; they yield no milk to mix with the **Soma**, they need not the vessel (for the libation); bring them to us; (bring also) the wealth of the son of the usurer, and give us **Maghavan**, (the possessions) of the low branches (of the community).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Kīkaṭas: (**Nirukta** 6.32) are people who do not perform worship, who are infidels, **nāstikas**; in countrie sinhabited by anāryas (kīkaṭā **nāma** deśonāryanivāsaḥ); na tapanti gharmāṇi: harmyam = a house;

Gharmāṇi = a vessel termed **mahāvīra** used at the rite called **pragṛhya**: pragṛh yākhyā karmopa yuktam mahāvīrapātram, which the cattle do not warm by yielding their milk to it;

Usurer: ā **bhara** pramagandasya **vedas**: maganda = kusidin, or usurer, one who says to himself, the money that goes from me will come back doubled, and pra = a patronymic; low branches of the community: naicāśākham, that which belongs to a low (**nīca**) branch, or class (**śākha**); the posterity born of **Śūdras** and the like
