## English translation:

“May the horse be steady, the axle be strong, the pole be not defective, the yoke not be rotten; may **Indra** preserve the two yoke-pins from decay; car with uninjured felloes, be ready for us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The horses: gāvau gaccheta iti gāvau aśvau: **gāvā** implies those who go, or, in this plural ce, horses; car be ready for us: **Viśvāmitra** being about to depart from the sacrifice of **Sudās**, invokes good fortune for his conveyance
