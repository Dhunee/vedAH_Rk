## English translation:

“These (sacrificers) are the **Bhojas**, of whom the diversified **Aṅgirasas** (are the priests); and the heroic sons of the expeller (of the foes of the gods) from heaven, bestowing riches upon **Viśvāmitra** at the sacrifice of a thousand (victims), prolong (his) life.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

These sacrificers are the Bhojas: ime **bhojā** aṅgiraso **virūpā**: bhojā = **kṣatriya** descendants of **Sudās**, **sudāsaḥ** kṣatriya, yāgam kurvāṇaḥ, instrumental tuting the sacrifice at which the latter, **Medhātithi**, and the rest of the race of **aṅgiras** were their yājakas, or officiating priests; the expeller: **rudra**, his sons are the **maruts**; sacrifice of a thousand victims: sahasrasave = the **aśvamedha**
