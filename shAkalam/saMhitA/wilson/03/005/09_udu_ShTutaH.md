## English translation:

“Praised and (nourished) by fuel, the mighty **Agni**, stationed on the (altar the) navel of the earth, in the form of the firmament, has shone (brightly); may the friendly and adorable Agni who respires in the mid-heaven, the messenger (of the gods), bring them to the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who respires in the mid-heaven: **mātariśvan**: mātari, antarikṣe; śvasiti, **sūrya** rūpeṇa ceṣṭate, who breathes in mid-heaven, or acts in the form of the sun; or, mātari may imply arṇye, in a forest, he who abides in the woods (**Nirukta** 7.26); also, mātariśvan = the wind, as in the next hymn
