## English translation:

“The mighty **Agni**, being the best of the heavenly luminaries, sustained the heaven with radiance, when the wind kindled the bearer of oblations, (till then concealed) in a cave from the **Bhṛgus**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Concealed from the Bhṛgus: yadi bhṛgubhyaḥ **guhā** santam: bhṛgubhyaḥ = ādityasya raśmibhyaḥ, from the rays of the sun
