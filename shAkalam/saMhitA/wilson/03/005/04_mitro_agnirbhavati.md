## English translation:

“**Agni**, when kindled, is **Mitra**; and, as Mitra, is the invoker (of the gods); **Varuṇa** is **Jātavedas**; Mitra is the ministering priest; Damunas is the agitator (**Vāyu**); Mitra (is the associate) of rivers and mountains.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The hymn attempts to identify Agni with Mitra, the sun, and of both with Varuṇa and Vāyu
