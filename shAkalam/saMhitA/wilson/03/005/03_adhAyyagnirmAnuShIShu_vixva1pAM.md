## English translation:

“**Agni**, the embryo of the waters, the friend (of the pious), accomplishing (all desires) with truth, has been plural ced (by the gods) among men, the descendants of **Manu**; desirable and adorable, he has taken his station on high, where the wise Agni is to receive the oblations of the devout.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Taken his station on high: sānvasthā = **sānu** ucchritam; i.e. uttaravedyākhyam, the plural ce called the north altar
