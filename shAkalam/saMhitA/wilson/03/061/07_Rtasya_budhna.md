## English translation:

“The showerer (of rain, the sun), urging on the lawn, at the root of the truthful (day) has pervaded the vast heaven and earth; the mighty Uṣas, the golden light, as it were, of **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, diffuses her lustre in different directions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The truthful day: ṛtasya satyabhūtasya: it is identified with truth as the season in the performance of religious rites
