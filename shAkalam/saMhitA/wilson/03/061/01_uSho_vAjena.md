## English translation:

“Affluent Uṣas, giver of sustenance, possessed of intelligence, be propitiated by the praise of him who lauds you, (and worships) with (sacrificial) food; divine Uṣas, adored by all, who (though) ancient are (still) young, the object of manifold worship, you are present at the recurring (morning) rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

RV. 1.48.16; 1.123.11
