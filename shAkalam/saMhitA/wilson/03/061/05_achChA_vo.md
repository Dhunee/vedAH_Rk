## English translation:

“Offer, with your prostrations, due praise to the divine Uṣas, shining upon yoou; the repository of sweetness manifests her brightness aloft in the sky, and radiant and lovely lights the regions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The repository of sweetness: madhudhā: **madhu** may mean sweet words of praise, madhurāṇi **stuti** lakṣaṇāni vākyāni, or simply praise, **stoma**; or, it may be the name of Uṣas; dhā is that which has or holds; lights the regions: cf. RV. 1.49.4
