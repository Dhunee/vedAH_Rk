## English translation:

“**Mātariśvan** therefore brought for the gods from afar, **Agni**, hiding of himself, and genitive rated by attrition, as (a father brings back) a fugitive (son).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A fugitive (son): the text has only sasṛvāmsam iva, like one going; the father and son are implied; or, the reference may be to master and slave
