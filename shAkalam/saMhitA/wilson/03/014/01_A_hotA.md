## English translation:

“The invoker (of the gods), the exhilarator (of his worshippers), the true, the offerer of sacrifice, the most wise, the creator, is present at our sacred rites. **Agni**, the son of strength, whose chariot is the lightning, whose hair is flame, manifests his glory on the earth.”
