## English translation:

“May the good-bestowing day and night hasten to you while you, **Agni** meet them on the paths of the wind; since (the priests) ever worship you preceding (them) with oblations, whilst they (united) like the pole (and the yoke of a wagon), abide successively in our dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Preceding: pūrvyam = **sāyam** **prātaḥ** kālayoḥ pūrvyam, i.e., Agni is worshipped at dawn before the day, and in the evening before night
