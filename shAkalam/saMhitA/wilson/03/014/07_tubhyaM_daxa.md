## English translation:

“Divine (**Agni**), mighty and omniscient, these (are the offerings) which we mortals present to you in the sacrifice; do you be cognizant of every respectable worshipper, and partake, immortal of all (his offerings) on this occasion.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be cognizant: **viśvasya** surathasya **bodhi**: know that I am his protector, gopāyitā bhavāmi iti budhyasva;

**Suratha** = liṭ, one who has a good chariot, śobhanayānopetasya
