## English translation:

“Approaching you, benevolent **Agni**, and performing all holy acts that are the cause of opulence, offering oblations with earnestness and in abundance, may we overcome the hostile hosts that are without gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May we overcome the hostile: abhiṣyāma pṛtanāyūr adevān;or, it may mean, may we overcome the hosts of those who are not gods, i.e. the **rākṣasas**, or evil spirits, obstructing sacrifices
