## English translation:

“Aggregated in the womb of the waters, (his rays) spread abroad; and omniform, are here effective for the diffusion of the sweet (**Soma**), like kine full uddered; the mighty (Heaven and Earth) are the fitting parents of the graceful **Agni**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The womb of the waters: the **antarikṣa**, mid-heaven, or the firmament, the region of vapour
