## English translation:

“**Agni** everywhere repairs to the undevouring, undevoured (waters); the vast (offspring) of the firmament, not clothed, yet not naked, seven eternal ever youthfful rivers, sprung from the same source, received Agni as their common embryo.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Undevouring, undevoured waters: anadatir adabdhā, not extinguishing Agni, nor yet evaporated by him; not clothed: avasānā anagnā, not wearing garments but invested by the water as by a robe
