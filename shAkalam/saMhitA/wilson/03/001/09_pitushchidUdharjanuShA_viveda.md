## English translation:

“At his birth he knew the udder of his parent and let forth its torrents, and its speech (of thunder); there was no one to detect him, lurking in the deep, with his auspicious associates, (the winds), and the many (waters) of the firmament.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Knew the udder of his parent: piturūdhan viveda: the parent here is the firmament, and the udder the clouds, or the accusative ulated stores of rain
