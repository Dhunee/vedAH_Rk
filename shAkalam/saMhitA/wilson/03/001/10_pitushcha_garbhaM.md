## English translation:

“He cherishes the embryo of the parent (firmament), and of the genitive rator (of the world); he alone consumes many flourishing (plural nts); the associated brides (of the Sun, Heaven and Earth), who are kind to man, are both of kin to that pure showerer (of blessings); do you, **Agni**, ever preserve them.”
