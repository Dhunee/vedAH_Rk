## English translation:

“Render me vigorous, **Agni**, since you have made me the bearer of the **Soma** to offer it in the sacrifice; honouring the gods who are present, I take hold of the stone (to express Soma); I propitiate them; do you, Agni, protect my person n.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Viśvāmitra** was a **kṣatriya**, of royal or military profession, and was also a monarch for some time; he descended from **Kuśa** or the lunar lineage and was the ancestor of many royal and saintly person ns, who, like himself, were called after their common ancestor, **Kuśikas**, or **Kauśikas**. By the force of his austerities, he compelled **Brahmā** to admit into the **Brāhmaṇa** order. He sought this position to be equated with **Vasiṣṭha**, which whom he had disputed earlier. The circumstances of his dispute with Vasiṣṭha are detailed in the **Rāmāyaṇa**; the legend is also told in the **Mahābhārata**, **Vāyu**, **Viṣṇu** and **Bhāgavata Purāṇas**. Viśvāmitra and Vasiṣṭha had the patronage of hostile princes; but both had friendly relations with the royal family of **Ayodhyā**, or King **Daśaratha** and his son, **Rāma**
