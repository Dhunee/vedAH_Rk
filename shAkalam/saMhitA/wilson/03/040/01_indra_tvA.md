## English translation:

“We invoke you, **Indra**, showerer (of benefits), to the effused libation; you drink of the exhilarating **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra: a number of etymologies: from **Nirukta** and **Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka**: he who sports (ramate), in the Soma (**indu**); or, he who shows this (idam) universe; or, he who divides (dṛṇāti), or gives (dadāti), or takes (dadhātī), or causes to worship (dārayati), or possesses (dhārayati) spiritous liquor (iram), or who runs or passes (dravadi), the Soma (indau); or kindles or animates (inddhe) living beings; or he who beholds the pure spirit, or **Brahmā**, which is this (idam) universe; the grammarians derive it from idi, to rule with the affix -ran
