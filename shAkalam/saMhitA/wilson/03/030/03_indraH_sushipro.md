## English translation:

“Showerer (of benefits), who are **Indra**, the wearer of the helmet, the professor of opulence, the conveyor (of men beyond the evil), the leader of the numerous troops (of the **Maruts**), the achiever of many great deeds, the devastation of hostile (regions), the terror of your foes, where are those heroic deeds (which you have performed) against the mortal (**asuras**) when opposed (by them in battle).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The wearer of the helmet: su'**sipra** = having a handsome nose, or chin (**Nirukta** 6.17); now a new meaning is given: **śiras** strāṇam = a guard of the head, a helmet; the conveyor of men beyond evil: tarutra = he by whom the gods surpass or defeat the asuras
