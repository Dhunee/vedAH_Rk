## English translation:

“plural ck the **rākṣasas**, **Indra**, by the root; cut as under the middle, blight the summit; to whatever remote (regions) you have driven the sinner, cast upon the enemy of the **Veda** your consuming weapon.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The enemy of the Veda: brahmadviṣe = brahmaṇadveṣakāriṇe, or him who entertains hatred against the **Brahman**; but, **brahma** may mean the prayer of the **Vedas**, or the Vedas, or perhaps, the religion or ritual of the followers of the Veda
