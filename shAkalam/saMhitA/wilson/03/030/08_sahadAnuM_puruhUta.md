## English translation:

“**Indra**, who is invoked by many, grind to dust the reviling malevolent **Vṛtra** opposing you, dwelling with the mother of the **Dānavas**, and increasing in might, until having deprived him of **hand** and foot, you have destroyed him by your strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 18.69; having deprived him of hand: sahadānum kṣiyantam sampiṇak kuṇārum: the allegory is the destruction of the cloud; or, it may mean, united with the dānavas;

Sahau = **sahas**, strength;

Kṣiyantam = badhamānam, rain opposing; or, nikaṭavartamānam, being near to;

Kuṇāru = either a proper name of an **asura**, a noisy one, kvaṇanaśīlam, or evil speaking, durvacavadanam; or, parikavaṇana, loud-sounding; anothe rinterpretation: crush the increasing cloud shedding water, sahadānum udakadānapetam; abiding in the sky, kṣiyantam ākāśe nivasantam; and thundering, kuṇārum = garjantam
