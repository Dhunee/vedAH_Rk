## English translation:

“**Indra**, be firm, for there are obstructors of your path; secure to the worshipper and his friends (the means of completing) the sacrifice; mortal enemies bearing bows, armed with mischievous weapons, and coming with evil intent, must be destroyed (by you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mortal enemies: martyāsaḥ = mārayitāraḥ, killers, murderers
