## English translation:

“**Sūrya** harms not the quarters (of the horizon), set open daily (for his journey), the progeny of **Haryaśva**; when he has traversed the roads (he is to travel), then he lets loose his horses, for such is his office.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Harms not the quarters: **diśaḥ** sūryo na mināti na hiṃsati = he does not injure;

Haryaśva = **Indra**, or he with the tawny horses
