## English translation:

“Let (your car), **Indra**, drawn by your horses (rush) downwards (upon the **asuras**); let your destroying thunder-bolt fall upon your enemies; slay those that assail in front or in rear, or that fly (from the combat); make the universe (the abode of) truth; (let such power) be concentrated in you.”
