## English translation:

“The heavy cloud, the receptacle of water, dreading you its destroyer, opened out before (you had cast your bolt); then **Indra** made easily-traversed paths for the waters to issue, and desirable and loud sounding they proceeded to the (waters of the earth) invoked of many.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Heavy cloud: alātṛṇo **valaḥ** = a cloud, that which by its abundance of water, is able to do mischief; cf. **Nirukta** 6.2; desirable and loud-sounding: prāvan puruhūtam, vāṇirdhamantīḥ = vananīyaḥ 'sabdāyamānās-tā āpaḥ puruhūtam bahubhirāhūtam pārthivam udakam abhyagacchan;

Dhamantīḥ = dhamatirgatikarmā (Nirukta 6.2)
