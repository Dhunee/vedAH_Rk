## English translation:

“May we, exempt from disease, rejoicing in (abundant) food, roaming free over the wide (expanse) of the earth, diligent in the worship of **Āditya**, ever be in the good favour of **Mitra**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Roaming free: mitajñavaḥ = mitajānuka, with measured knees; i.e. yathākāmam **sarvatra** gacchantaḥ, going everywhere at plural asure
