## English translation:

“**Mitra**, when praised, animates men to exertion; **Indra** sustains both the earth and heaven; Mitra looks upon men with unclosing eyes; offer to Mitra the oblations of clarified butter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mitra: signifies the sun, who is measured or appreciated (miyate) by all, and who preserves (trāyate) the world, by bestowing rain; cf. **Nirukta**. 10.22
