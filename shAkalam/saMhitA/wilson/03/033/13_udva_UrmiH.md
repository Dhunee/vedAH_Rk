## English translation:

“Let your waves (rivers) so flow that the pin of the yoke may be above (their) waters; leave the traces full, and may (the two streams), exempt from misfortune or defect, and uncensured, exhibit no (present) increase.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The pin: **śamyā**, yugkīla; or, the ropes that are fastened to the ends of the yoke, the traces: yugyakaṇṭha pārśvādi **saṃlagna** rajjavaḥ; yoktrāṇi is also similarly explained; perhaps, these refer to the traces; exhibit no present increase: ma śūnam āratām: śūnam = samṛddhim, increase, referring merely to the present moment; i.e., may the rivers not so rise as to prevent his passage; or, it may convey a wish that the rivers might never suffer any diminution, taking śūnam in the sense of śūnyam, emptiness
