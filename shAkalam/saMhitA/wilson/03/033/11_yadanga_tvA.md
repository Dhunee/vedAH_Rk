## English translation:

“**Viśvāmitra** speaks: (Since), rivers, (you have allowed me to cross), so may the **Bharatas** pass over (your united stream); may the troop desiring to cross the water, permitted (by you), and impelled by **Indra**, pass; then let the course appinted for your going (be resumed); I have recourse to the favour of you who are worthy of adoration.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Bharatas: said to be the same lineage as Viśvāmitra's: bharakulajā madiyāḥ sarve; perhaps this means, those who were the bearers of Viśvāmitra's goods and chattels; **Mahābhārata**, **Ādi Parva** 5.3734 cites **Vasiṣṭha** as the family priest of the Bharatas
