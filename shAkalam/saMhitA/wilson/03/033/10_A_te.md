## English translation:

“The rivers speak: Hymner, we hear your words, that you have come from afar with a wagon and chariot; we bow down before you; like a woman nursing (her child), like a maiden bending to embrace a man, (so will we do) for you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

For you: te is repeated at the end of the line; it is repeated out of respect, te iti punaruktir ādarārtham
