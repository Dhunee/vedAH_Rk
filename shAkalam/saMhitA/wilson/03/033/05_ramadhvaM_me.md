## English translation:

“**Viśvāmitra** speaks: Rivers, charged with water, rest a moment from your course at my request, who go to gather the **Soma**; I, the son of **Kuśika**, desirous of protection, address with earnest prayer especially the river before me.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At my request: me vacase somyāya = to my speech importing the soma, i.e. the object of my address is, that having crossed over, I may go to gather the soma; cf. **Nirukta** 2.25; the river before me: that is, the **śutudri**
