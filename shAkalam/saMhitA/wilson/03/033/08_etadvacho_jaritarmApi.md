## English translation:

“The rivers speak: Praiser of **Indra**, forget not this speech, nor the worlds that (you have addressed to us) for future ages (to reverence); celebrator (of holy rites), be favourable to us in solemn prayers; treat us not after the (arrogant fashion) of men; salutation be to you!”
