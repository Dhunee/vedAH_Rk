## English translation:

“The wise worship, with (pious) rites, **Agni**, the sign of sacrifices, the accomplishment of the solemnity, in whom the reciters of (his) praises have accusative ulated (their) acts (of devotion), and from whom the worshipper hopes for happiness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The sign of sacrifices: ketum yajñānām: **ketu** = a banner; it is often used in the **Veda** in the sense of prajñāpaka, a sign, a signal, that which makes any thing known
