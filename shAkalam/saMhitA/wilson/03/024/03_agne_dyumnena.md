## English translation:

“**Agni**, son of strength, vigilant (in the exercise of) your energy, take your seat when invoked on the sacred grass (strewn at) my (sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vigilant: dyumnena jāgṛve = svatejasā **sarvadā** jāgaraṇopeta (jāgṛvir jāgaraṇāt: **Nirukta** 9.8), always endowed with his vigilance by own lustre or energy, **loka**-rakṣārtham, for the preservation of the world
