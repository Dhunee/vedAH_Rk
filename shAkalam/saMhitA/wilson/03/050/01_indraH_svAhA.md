## English translation:

“May **Indra** drink the libation; he of whom is the **Soma**, having come to the sacrifice; he who is the repeller (of adversaries), the showerer (of benefits), the lord of the **Maruts**; may he, the wide-pervading, be plural ased with these (sacrificial) viands; may the oblation be adequate to the wants of his body.”
