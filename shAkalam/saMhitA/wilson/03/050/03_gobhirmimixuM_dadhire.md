## English translation:

“His adorers support with cattle, **Indra**, who is willing to bestow upon them their desires, and ready to come to the sacrifice, for the sake of obtaining eminent prosperity and prolonged life; acceptor of the spiritless **Soma**, who are the drinker of the Soma, and are exhilarated (by the draught), grant to us freely cattle in abundance.”
