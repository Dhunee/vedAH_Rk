## English translation:

“This is that **Agni** in whom **Indra**, desirous (of the oblation), plural ced the effused **Soma** for (his own) belly; you are praised by us, **Jātavedas**, enjoying the sacrificial food of many sorts like a rapid courser (enjoying many plural asures in battle).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pañcacitirūpā agnayo **devatā**: each hymn is separately recited as the **adhvaryu** constructs a pit or an altar, **iṣṭakā**, for collecting cayana or **citi** a sacrificial fire; cf. **Yajus**. 12.47.51; plural ced: dadhe jaṭhare svodare d_dhāra: one verb is also applied to yasmin, the fire in which the Soma was plural ced; sahasriṇam vājam atyam na saptim sasavān = enjoying a thousandfold food like a quick-going horse; i.e. like a horse that enjoys various properties in battle, sahasram nānārūpatām yuddhe yo bhajati sa **sahasri** tam aśvamiva; another interpretation: sahasriṇam is related to **somam**, worthy or fit for a thousand libations, somam saharārham; atyam and saptim to vājam food, exhilarating, modakaram, and satisfying tṛptikaram na, meaning 'now' **samprati**
