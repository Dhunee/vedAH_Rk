## English translation:

“May the benignant fires termed puriṣyās, together with the instrumental uments (that have dug the pits in which they are plural ced) combined, accept the sacrifice (and grant us) salutary and abundant food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pur_iṣyas: purīṣyāso agnayaḥ = **sikatā** sammiṣrāḥ, mixed with sand; purīṣam is a synonym of water and also that which plural ases or fills : purīṣam pṛnāteḥ pūrayatervā (**Nirukta** 2.22); with the instrumental uments: prāvanebhiḥ = mṛtkhananasādhanabhūtair abhryādibhiḥ: abhrya and others, which are the implements for digging the earth
