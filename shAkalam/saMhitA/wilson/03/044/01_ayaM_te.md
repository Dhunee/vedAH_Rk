## English translation:

“May this desirable and gratifying **Soma** expressed by the stones,by, **Indra**, for you ascend the verdant chariot, and with your tawny (steeds) come to us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The **sūkta** highlights the changes on the derivatives of the root hri, to take; the former sūkta used the root vṛṣ, shower. haryataḥ = taking, captivating, desirable; **harit**, the stone that bruises the Soma; Indra's horses in the dual or plural ral, are **hari**, **harayaḥ**;

Harit = green;

**Haryaśvaḥ** = he who has the horses called hari;

Haridhayasam = yellow-rayed;

Harivarpasam = green-coloured
