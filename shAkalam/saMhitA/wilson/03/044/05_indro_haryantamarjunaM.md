## English translation:

“**Indra** has uncovered the desirable white-coloured, fast-flowing **Soma**, effused by the expressing stones, and overlaid with the shining (milk and other liquids), in like manner as when, borne by his tawny steeds, he rescued the cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra discovers or uncovers the hidden Soma; this act was ascribed to **Pūṣan** in another text
