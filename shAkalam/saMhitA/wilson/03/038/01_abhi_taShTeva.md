## English translation:

“Repeat (to **Indra**) pious praise, as a carpenter (plural nes the wood), and engaging (zealously in sacred rites), as a quick horse bearing well his burden; endowed with intelligence, and refllecting upon the future acts acceptable (to Indra), I desire to behold the sages (whohave gone to heaven).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As a quick horse: the instrumental tutor of the rite is supposed here to address the officiating priests, urging them to be diligent laboureres, like the carpenter of the pack-horse; acts acceptable to Indra: abhipriyāṇi marmṛśat parāṇi kavīṇicchāmi sandṛśe: priyāṇi = indrasya priyatamāni;

Parāṇi = uttamāni, best and most dear to Indra;

Karmāṇi = acts; or, parāṇi = acts to be done on subsequent days, uttareśvahassu kriyamāṇāni;

**Kavi** = krāntadarśī a seer of the past;here, it is said to mean a holy person n who, for his assiduous devotion, has attained deification, yaḥ pūrvam anuṣṭhitayajñaiḥ devabhūyam agamat; so, ye vai tena ṛṣayaḥ purve pretās te vai kavayaḥ (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 6.20)
