## English translation:

“You two secure the great felicity of the ancient (worshipper), that which is happiness in heaven; do you (therefore) be even about us; all those who exercise illusion, contemplate the manifold expoits of the everlasting and blandly-speaking **Indra**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

All those who exercise illusion: viśve māyinaḥ = sarve **devāḥ**, all the gods; **māyā** also signifies wisdom, intelligence,hence, may also mean the wise;

**Māya** = deceivers, or **asuras**
