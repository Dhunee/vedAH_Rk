## English translation:

“Royal **Indra** and **Varuṇa**, embellish the three universal sacrifices (and make them) full (of all requisites) for this celebration; you have gone to the rite, for I have beheld in my mind, at this solemnity, the **gandharvas** with hair (waving) in the wind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The gandharvas: gandharvān vāyukeśān: the gandharvas are the guardians of the **Soma**, somarakṣakān; similar beings are cited in **Taittirīya**: svānabhrājān, bambhāre, hasta, **suhasta**, kṛśāṇahete vaḥ somakrayaṇās, tān rakṣadhvammā vo dabhan
