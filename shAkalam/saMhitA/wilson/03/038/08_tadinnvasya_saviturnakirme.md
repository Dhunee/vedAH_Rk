## English translation:

“No one (distinguishes) my golden lustre from that of this **Savitā**, in which (lustre) he has taken refuge; gratified by pious praise, he cherishes the all-fostering heaven and earth as a woman cherishes her offspring.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The Savitā: **asya** savitur nakir me: savitā = **Indra**, sarvasya jagato antaryāmitayā prerayitur indrasya, of Indra the impeller, through his being the internal pervader of the whole world
