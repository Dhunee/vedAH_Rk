## English translation:

“They all ornamented (**Indra**) standing (in his car) and, clothed in beauty, he proceeds self-radiant; wonderful are the acts of that showerer (of benefits), the influencer (of consciences), who omniform, presides over the ambrosial (waters).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The influencer of consciences: the text has only asurasya; the term is explained by prerakasya antaryāmitava, impeller, from being in the inner spirit
