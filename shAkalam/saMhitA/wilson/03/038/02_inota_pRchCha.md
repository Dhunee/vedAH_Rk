## English translation:

“Ask of the lords (of earth, the holy teachers), the birth of those deified sages, who with well-governed minds, and diligent in sacred rites, fabricated the heavens; and may these propitiatory (praises), augmenting (your power) and rapid as the wind, reach you at this solemn rite.”
