## English translation:

“Comprehending hidden (mysteries) here on earth, they have, through their power, made manifest (the things of) heaven and earth; they have set limits to themby their elements; they connected them both mutually united, wide-spread and vast, and fixed the intermediate (firmament) to sustain them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

They have set limits: sam mātrābhir mamire = mātrābhiḥ rodasyau iyattayā paricchinne cakruḥ, wiḥ the elements they made determinate divisions of heaven and earth by so much, i.e., to a definite limit or extent
