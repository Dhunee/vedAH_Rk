## English translation:

“Radiant with great glory, repel the hostile **rākṣasas** and **piśācas**; may I be in (the enjoyment) of the favour of the great (**Agni**), the giver of prosperity, and in the service of (him who is) easily invoked.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Yajus**. 2.49; dviṣo rakṣaso amīvāḥ: amīvā is either an epithet of the rākṣasas, free from sickness, vigorous, strong; or, it may be a synonym of piśācika, as hovering about the sacrifice in order to interrupt it; amīvā may mean keep off diseases (**vyādhi**), vyādhaṃśca badhasva
