## English translation:

“Consider yourself our protector at the breaking of the dawn today and when the sun has risen; **Agni**, who is engendered with (embodied) form, be plural ased with my constant praise, as a father (is plural ased with) his son.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When the sun has risen: some perform the worship of fire before the sun-rise, some after the sun has risen; with (embodied) form: tanvā **sujātaḥ**, well-born with a body, i.e. with flames; or, it may mean self-born, **svayambhu**; as a father: janmeva tanayam, yathā **pitā** putram sevate, **janma**, being put for **janaka**
