## English translation:

“The gods who gratify the universe with rain are present at the seven offerings (of the ministering priests), when solicited with (sincerity of) mind; may the many deities who are engendered in sensible shapes at sacrifices come to this our rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Deities in sensible shapes: in preceding **sūktas**, the doors of the hall of sacrifice, are the person nifications specified; here, the divinities presiding over the doors are implied
