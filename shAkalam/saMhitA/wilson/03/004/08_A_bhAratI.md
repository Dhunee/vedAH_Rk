## English translation:

“May **Bhāratī**, associated with the **Bhāratīs**; Iḷā with the gods and men; and **Agni**, and **Sarasvatī** with the **Sārasvatas**; may the three goddesses sit down upon the sacred grass (strewn) before them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bhāratībhiḥ, with the connections of **Bharata**, or the Sun: bharatasya sūryasya sambandhinībhiḥ, perhaps intending the solar rays;

Bhāratī = vāk, speech;

Iḷā = **bhūmi**, the earth;

Sarasvatī = **mādhyamikā** vāk; the sārasvatas are the madhyamasthānas, the middle regions, or the firmament; Agni whose name is rather unconnectedly inserted, is thus identified through their several person nifications as goddesses, with heaven, mid-heaven, and earth, or with speech or sound in the three regions
