## English translation:

“I propitiate the two chief divine invokers of the gods; the seven offerers of (sacrificial) food, expectant of water, gratify (**Agni**) with oblations; the illustrious observers of sacred rites have saluted him in every ceremony as (identifiable), verily, with water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As identifiable with water: ṛtam it ta āhuḥ = agnim eva ṛtabhūtam āhuḥ, they have called Agni, verily, ṛta; ṛta is usually rendered water but
it may mean truth; in the preceding phrase, ṛtam śansanta = udakam, desirous or expectant of water
