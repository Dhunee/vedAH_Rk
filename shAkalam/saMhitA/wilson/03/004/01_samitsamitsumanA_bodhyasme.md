## English translation:

“Repeatedly, kindled, (**Agni**), wake up favourably disposed; (endowed) with reiterated lustre, entertain the kind purpose of (granting us) wealth; bring, divine Agni, the gods to the sacrifice; do you, the friend (of the gods), minister, well-affected, to (your) parents.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Repeatedly kindled: **samit** **sama** = samiddha; or, susamiddha, an appellative of Agni in the preceding **sūktas**
