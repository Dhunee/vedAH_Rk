## English translation:

“An upward path has been prepared for you both in the sacrifice; the blazing oblations soar aloft; the invoker of the gods has sat down in the centre of the radiant (hall); let us strew the sacred grass for the seats of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You both: **Agni** and the **Barhis**, or sacred grass, to which, as in the parallel pages, the hymn is addressed
