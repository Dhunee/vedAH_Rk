## English translation:

“**Agni**, kindled into flame, come to our presence in the same chariot with **Indra** and with the swift-moving gods; may **Aditi**, the mother of excellent sons, sit down on the sacred grass, and may the immortal gods be satisfied with the reverentially-offered oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May the immortal gods: **svāhā** **devā** **amṛtā** mādayantām: svāhā = svāhākāreṇa **yuktaḥ**, joined with or addressed by the exclamation, svāhā
