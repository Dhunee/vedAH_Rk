## English translation:

“They who encouraged you, **Maghavan**, to slay Ahi, who (aided you) in the conflict with **Śambara**, and in the recovery of the cattle, and who, possessed of wisdom, contribute verily to your exhilaration, with them, the troop of the **maruts**, do you **Indra**, drink the **Soma**.”
