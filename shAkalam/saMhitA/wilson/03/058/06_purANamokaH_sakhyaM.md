## English translation:

“Your ancient friendship is desirable and auspicious; your wealth, leaders (of rites), is in the family of **Jahnu**; renewing that auspicious friendship, may we, your associates, delight you with the sweet (**Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Jahnu: yuvor draviṇam jahnāvyām: from jahnu = jahnāvyām = jahnukulajāyām, born in the lineage of Jahnu; it may imply the **Gaṅgā**, **Jāhnavī**, following the legend of her origin from Jahnu
