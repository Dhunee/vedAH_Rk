## English translation:

“Eclipsing (by your splendour) many regions, **Aśvins**, (come hither); loud priase awaits you opulent (Aśvins) among men; come to this rite by the paths traversed by the gods; here, **Dasras**, are ample stores of the exhilarating (**Soma**) juices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nidhayo madhūnām: nidh is a kind of vessel, **pātra** **viśeṣaḥ**
