## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, this most sweet **Soma** is mixed; drink it; come to (our) dwelling; your car, repeatedly bestowing wealth, is coming to the appointed plural ce of the offerer of the libation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The appointed plural ce: niṣkṛtam = the plural ce of agreement, nir ityeṣaḥ; samitye tasya sthāne = **gṛha**, house (**Nirukta** 12.7)
