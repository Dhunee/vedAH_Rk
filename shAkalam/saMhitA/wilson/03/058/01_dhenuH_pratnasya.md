## English translation:

“The cow (the dawn) yields the desired milk to the ancient (**Agni**); the son of the south passes within (the firmament); the bright-houred (day) brings the illuminative (sun); the praiser awakes (to glorify) the **Aśvins** preceding the dawn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The son of the south: dakṣināyāḥ **putraḥ** = uṣasaḥ putraḥ **Sūrya**, the sun, the son of the dawn
