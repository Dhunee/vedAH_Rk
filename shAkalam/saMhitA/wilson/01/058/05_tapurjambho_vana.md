## English translation:

“The flame-weaponed and breeze-excited **Agni**, assailing the unexhaled moisture (of the trees), with all his strength, in a volume of fire, rushes triumphant (against all things) in the forest, like a bull, and all, whether stationary or moveable, are afraid of him as he flies along.”
