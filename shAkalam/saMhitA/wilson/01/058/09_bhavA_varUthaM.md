## English translation:

“Variously-shining **Agni**, be a shelter to him who praises you; be prosperity, **Maghavan**, to the wealthy (offerers of oblations); protect, Agni, your worshipper from sin; may Agni, who is rich with righteous acts, come (to us) quickly in the morning.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Maghavan = **Indra**; also, an epithet of Agni; lit. possessor of riches
