## English translation:

“Undecaying **Agni**, combining his food (with his flame), and devouring it quickly, ascends the dry wood; the blaze of theconsuming (element) spreads like a (fleet) courser, and roars like a roaring (cloud) in the height of heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Adma** = food or what may be eaten, explained as tṛṇagulmādiam, straw and twigs;
