## English translation:

“Offer, **Nodhas**, earnest praise to the company of the **Maruts**, the senders of rain and ripeners of fruit, deserving of adoration. Composed, and with folded **hands**, I utter the praises conceived in my mind, which are efficacious in sacred rites, (and flow rreadily) as the waters.”
