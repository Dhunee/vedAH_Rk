## English translation:

“They were born handsome and vigorous from the sky, the sons of **Rudra**, the conquerors of their foes, pure from sin, and purifying (all), radiant as suns, powerful as evil spirits, diffusers of rain-drops, and of fearful forms.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rudrasya maryāḥ = lit. the mortals or men of rudra; since the **Maruts** are immortal the term should imply sons; maruts are called rudrasya **sunuḥ** = sons of Rudra. satvāno na: satvānaḥ = parameśvarasya **bhūtagaṇaḥ**, the troops of demons attendant on **Parameśvara** or **Śiva**
