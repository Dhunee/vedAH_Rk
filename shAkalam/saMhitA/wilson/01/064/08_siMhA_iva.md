## English translation:

“The most wise **Maruts** roar like lions; the all-knowing are graceful as the spotted deer, destroyign (their foes), delighting (their worshippers); of deadly strength in their anger, they come with their antelopes and their arms, (to defend the sacrificer) against interruption.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pṛṣatibhiḥ = with spotted deer, **vāhanas** or steeds of the Maruts
