## English translation:

“**Maruts**, who are distinguished in troops, who are benevolent to men, who are heroes, and whose strength is deadly in your anger, you make heaven and earth resound (at your coming); your (glory) sits in the seat-furnished chariots, conspicuous as (a beautiful) form, or as the lovely lightning.”
