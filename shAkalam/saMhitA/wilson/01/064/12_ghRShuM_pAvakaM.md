## English translation:

“We invoke with praise the foe-destroying, all-purifying, water-shedding, all-surveying band of **Maruts**, the offspring of **Rudra**; (priests) to obtain prosperity, have recourse to the dust-raising and powerful band of Maruts, receiving libations from sacred vessels, and showering down (benefits).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Receiving libations from sacred vessels: ṛjiṣiṇam abhiṣunv.vanti, they (the priests) pour the **soma** into the vessel. ṛjiṣam = a frying-pan; in context, is means any sacrificial vessel
