## English translation:

“Augmenters of rain, they drive with golden wheels the clouds asunder, as elephants (in a herd break down the trees in their way); they are honoured with sacrifices, visitants of the hall of offering, spontaneous assailers (of their foes), subverters of what are stable, immoveable themselves, and wearers of shining weapons.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As elephants: āpathyo na, lit. like that which is produced or occurs on the road; alt. meaning: like a chariot which drives over and crushes sticks and straws on the way
