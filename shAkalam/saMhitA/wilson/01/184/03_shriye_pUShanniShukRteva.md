## English translation:

“Divine **Aśvins**, in whom is no untruth, (darting) like arrows to acquire glory, and to carry off **Sūrya**, to you are addressed the prayers that are recited at holy rites, for (the completion of) the uninterrupted, sin-removing (sacrifice), as ancient ages (offered them).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Divine Aśvins: the text has **Pūṣan**, an appellation of a form of the sun; it here connotes both the Aśvins, the one as the sun and the other as the moon;

Sūrya: the legend: a prize was offered of a hymn of thousand stanzas, which the Aśvins also won; but, at the request of **Agni** and other competitors, they gave up to them portions of the hyumn; sin removing sacrifice: varuṇasya bhureḥ = avicchinnasya varuṇasya **phala** pratibandhaka pāpanivārakasya yāgasya, of the uninterrupted sacrifice which is obstructive of the sin that intercepts the reward
