## English translation:

“The radiant **Indra** proceeds (along the firmament) with the manifestation of the **Rudras**; through the Rudras, speech spreads with more expansive celerity, and praise glorifies the renowned Indra; him, attended by the **Maruts**, we invoke to become our friend.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra is radiant through identity with the sun; Rudras are radiant identified with Maruts in their character of vital airs or **prāṇa**;

**Rudra** = from rud, to weep; when the vital airs depart fromt he body, they cause the kindred of the deceased to weep, hence they are called rudras
