## English translation:

“We invoke to be our friend, **Indra**, who is attended by the **Maruts**; he who, with increasing wrath, slew the mutilated **Vṛtra** and **Śambara**, and the unrighteous Pipru, and who extirpated the unabsorbable **Śuṣṇa**”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śambara and Pipru are **asuras**;

Pipru = avratam, not performing or opposing **vratas**, religious rites; aśuṣam śuṣṇam = the dryer up, i.e. who cannot be absorbed
