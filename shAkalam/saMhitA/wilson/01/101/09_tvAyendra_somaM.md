## English translation:

“Desirous of you, **Indra**, who are possessed of excellent strenghth, we pour forth to you libations desirous of you, who are obtained by prayer, we offer you oblations; therefore, do you, who are possessed of horses, sit down with plural asure upon the sacred grass, attended by the **Maruts**, at this sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

May Indra give us (a son), an offerer of praises, all-wise, and the subduer of foes; and (give us) also a chariot foremost in battle
