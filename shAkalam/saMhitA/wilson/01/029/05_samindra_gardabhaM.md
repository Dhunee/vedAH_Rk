## English translation:

“**Indra**, destroy this ass, (our adversary), praising you with such discordant speech; and do your, Indra, of boundless wealth, enrich us with thousands of excellent cows and horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nuvantam-pāpayāmuyā, praising with this speech that is of the nature of abuse (nindarūpayā **vācā**); hence, he is called an ass braying harsh sounds: yathā **gardabhaḥ** śrotum aśakyam paruṣam śabdam **karoti**
