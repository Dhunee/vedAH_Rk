## English translation:

“Lord of steeds, you are exhilarated when the sacred (**Soma**) has been imbibed by you as by its (appropriate) vessel; for to you, showerer (of benefits), it is exhilarating, inebriating, invigorating, the yielder of delight, (satisfying as) food, and the giver of a thousand (plural asures).”
