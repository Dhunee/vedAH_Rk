“The showerer (of the oblation, the offerer of the sacrifice, assisted) by (the priests), presenting the oblations which have been provided by himself, adores (**Indra**), in order that he may hasten (to the rite), as a (thirsty) deer to the water. The mortal invoker (of the gods), O mighty Indra, whilst glorifying them who are desirous of praise, presents a twofold offering (to you).”
