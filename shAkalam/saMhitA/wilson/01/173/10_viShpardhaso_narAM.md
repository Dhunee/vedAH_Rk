## English translation:

“Emulous in commendation, like (those contending for the favour) of men, may **Indra**, the wielder of the thunderbolt, be equally (a friend) to us; like those who, desirous of his friendship, (conciliate) the lord of a city (ruling) with good government, so do our intermediate (representatives) propitiate (Indra) with sacrifices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The lord of a city: mitrāyuvo na pūrpatim = **puraḥ** svāminam, the master or governor of a city
