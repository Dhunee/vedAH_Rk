## English translation:

“We offer to him, (**Indra**), the most pious (oblations); the worshippers of the gods present to him substantial (adorations); may he, of conspicuous lustre, standing in his car, and light-moving like the **Aśvins**, be gratified (by our worship).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Substantial adorations: cyautnāni = causing to fall down; but, this explained as dṛḍhāni, firm, hard
