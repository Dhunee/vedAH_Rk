## English translation:

“One man propitiates **Indra**, augmenting (his vigour) by sacrifice; another, who is insincere, worships (him), with mind averted, (to worldly thoughts); (to the first he is) like a lake to a thirsty (pilgrim) near a sacred spot; (to the other) like a long road, which retards the end (of the journey).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a lake: the comparisons may also refer to the sacrificers
