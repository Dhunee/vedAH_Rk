## English translation:

“The priests chant the heaven-ascending **sāma**, as you know (it), for such (praise) do we venerate as the cause of increase and conferrer of heaven, whence the kine, unimpeded, do honour to the divine (**Indra**), who is seated on the sacred grass.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The heaven-ascending sāma: the sāma, the hymn that the **udgatā** chants; the kind, unimpeded: gāvo dhenavaḥ;

Dhenavaḥ = adabdhā, unimpeded, unharmed;the cows may refer to the rains
