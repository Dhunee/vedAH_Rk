## English translation:

“Heaven and earth are insufficient for the girth of that **Indra**, who, with his greatness, rules over the leaders (of sacrifice); as the atmosphere encompasses the earth, so he encompasses (the **three worlds**), and, being the master of the rain, he upholds the sky as well as the firmament and the earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He upholds the sky: opaśam iva bibharti: opaśam = near to; may be appied to the earth and sky, as contiguous to heaven;

Opaśam = a horn; i.e. he upholds the sky as easily as a bull bears his horns
