## English translation:

“The invoker (of the gods, **Agni**), pervades the measured stations (of the altars), and accepts that (oblation), which is the germ of the year of the earth; as a horse neighs when bringing (the offering to **Indra**), as a bull bellows like a messenger proclaiming (his message) between heaven and earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As a horse neighs: the simile may illustrate the roaring of the sacrificial fire
