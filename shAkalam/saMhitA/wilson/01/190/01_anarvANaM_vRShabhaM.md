## English translation:

“(Priests), augment by your hymns **Bṛhaspati**, who deserts not (his worshipper); the showerer (of benefits) the plural asant-tongued, the adorable; of whom resplendent gods and men, (the ministers) of the instrumental tutor of the sacrifice, emulous in sacred songs, proclaim (the praise).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛhaspati is here defined as mantrasya pālayitāram, the protector of cherisher of the prayer
