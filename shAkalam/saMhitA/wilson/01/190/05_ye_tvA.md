## English translation:

“Divine **Bṛhaspati**, you do not bestow desired (wealth) upon those stupid (men), who, sinful and mean subsist, considering you, who are auspicious, as an old ox; but you favour him who offers (you) libations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As an old ox: tvā usriyam manyamānaḥ: usriya = a cow giving little milk; or an old one, jīrṇam anaḍvāham vā; but your favour: cayasa it piyārum, you go to bestow favour on him who sacrifices with the **Soma**; another interpretation: you destroy the malevolent (**Nirukta** 4.25)
