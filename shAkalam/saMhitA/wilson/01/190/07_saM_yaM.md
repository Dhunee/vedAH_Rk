## English translation:

“To whom praises (necessarily) proceed, as men (assemble round a master); as rivers, rolling between their banks, flow to the ocean; that wise **Bṛhaspati** greedy (after rain), and stationary in the midst, contemplates both (the ferry and the water).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That wise Bṛhaspati: ubhayam caṣṭe **antam**. bṛhaspatistara āpaśca **gṛdhraḥ**: gṛdhraḥ = vṛṣṭim ākāṅkṣamāṇa, desirous of rain;

**Taras** = taraṇam jalābhivṛddhim, crossing, or a ferry or increase of water;

**Apaḥ** =water; ubhayam antar madhye sthitvā, having stood in the middle; caṣṭe paśyate,he sees; or **karoti**, he does; identifying Bṛhaspati with **Indra**, ubhayam, both, may denote heaven and earth, between which in the **antarikṣa** or firmament, the region of the rain, is his proper station
