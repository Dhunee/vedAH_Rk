## English translation:

“The gloryof this **Bṛhaspati** spreads through heaven and earth like the sun; receiving worship, and giving intelligence, he bestows (the rewards of sacrifice); like the weapons of the hunters, so these (weapons) of Bṛhaspati fall daily upon the workers of guile.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the weapons of the hunters: mṛgāṇām na hetayaḥ = hantum anviṣyatam āyudhanīva, like the weapons of those seeking to kill
