## English translation:

“He is ready (to accept) the offered praise, the presentation of the homage, the hymn, as the sun (is ready) to put forth his rays; by the acts of him whom the **rākṣasas** (oppose not), the daily (revolving sun) exists, and he is strong as a fearful beast of prey.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He: or, the pronoun may apply to the **yajamāna**, who exerts himself to offer the praise, the oblation
