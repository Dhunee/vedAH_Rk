## English translation:

“The hymns of the (rainy) season are addressed to him, who is verily the creator (of the rain), and has granted it (to the prayers) of the devout; for that **Bṛhaspati** is the manifester (of all), the expansive wind that (dispensing) blessings has been produced for (the diffusion of) water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The hymns of the rainy season: ṛtivyā = varṣarttu sambandhinyo **vācaḥ**, prayers connected with the season of the rain
