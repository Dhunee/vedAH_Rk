## English translation:

“Be a (plural asant) way to him who goes well and makes good offerings, like the affectionate friend of (a ruler who) restrains the bad; and may those sinless men who instrumental uct us, although yet enveloped (by ignorance), stand extricated from their covering.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Those sinless men: abhi ye cakṣate naḥ, those who speak to us; who, bodhayantī, waken or instrumental uct us;; apīvṛtā, ajñānenāvṛtā, enveloped by ignorance; let those who revileus, and are being protected be deprived of that protection
