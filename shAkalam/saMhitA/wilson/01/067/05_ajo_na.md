## English translation:

“\[5-6\] Like the unborn (sun) he sustains the earth and the firmament, and props up the heaven with true prayers; **Agni**, in whom is all sustenance, cherish the plural ces that are grateful to animals; repair (to the spots) where there is no pasturage.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Propped up the heaven: the gods alarmed at the obliquity of the region of the sun and fearing that it might fall, propped it up with the metres of the **Veda** (**Taittirīya**). This act is attributed to Agni in this hymn. **Guha** guham gaḥ= guha means any arid or rugged tract unfit for pasture; sañcārayogyam sthānam, a plural ce unfit for grazing; hence, a region which may be scorched by Agni
