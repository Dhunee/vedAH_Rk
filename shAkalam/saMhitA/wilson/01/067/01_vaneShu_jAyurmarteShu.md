## English translation:

“\[1-2\] Born in the woods, the friend of man, **Agni** protects his worshipper, as a **rājā** favours an able man; kind as a defender, prosperous as a performer of (good) works, may he, the invoker of the gods, the bearer of oblations, be propitious.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Havyavāḥ = bearer of oblations to the gods; three **Agnis**: havyavāḥ (**havyavāhana**), that which conveys offerings to the gods; kavyavāḥ, that which conveys them to the **pitṛs** or manes; saharakṣas, that which receives those offered to the **rākṣasas**
