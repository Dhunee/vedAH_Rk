## English translation:

“**Indra**, who is invoked by many, attended by the moving (**Maruts**), having attacked the **Dasyus** and the Śimyus, slew them with his thunderbolt; the thunderer then divided the fields with his white-complexioned friends, and rescued the sun and set free the water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śimyus = enemies and **rākṣasas**; sakhibhi s-vitnyebhiḥ: winds or Maruts; allusion to earthly friends or worshippers of Indra, who were white (śvitnya)
