## English translation:

“May he, of whom the excellent measure (of all things), through strength, eternally and everywhere cherishes heaven and earth, propitiated by our acts, convey us beyond (evil); may **Indra**, associated with the **Maruts**, be our protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Śavasā**-mānam, the distributor of all things, through his power, i.e. he is the prototype of everything endued with vigour
