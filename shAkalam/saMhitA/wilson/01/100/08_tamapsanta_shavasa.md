## English translation:

“To him, a leader (to victory), his worshippers apply in contests of strength for protection and for wealth, as he grants them the light (of conquest) in the bewildering darkness (of battle); may **Indra**, associated with the **Maruts**, be our protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Jyotis**. = light; cit-**tāmasi** = in the darkness of thought; hopefully, Indra will give the light of knowledge to darkness of understanding
