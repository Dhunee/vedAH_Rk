## English translation:

“(Pupil): I beseech the **Soma**, which has been drunk in my heart, that it may fully expiate the sin we have committed; man is subject to many desires.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

What has been drunk in my heart: antito hṛtsu pītam, drunk mentally, not actually; the sin we have committed: the sin of listening ot the conversation of their **guru** with his wife
