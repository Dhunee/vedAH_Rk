## English translation:

“I glorify with sacred rites themighty Heaven and Earth, the augmenters of sacrifice, who (are to be contemplated) with devotion at holy ceremonies; those two, who, cherishing their worshippers as children, are venerated by the devout, and therefore with favour bestow (upon us) desirable blessings.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Cherishing their worshippers as children: devebhir ye devaputre sudaṃsasa" = who having the gods for children, are reverenced by the gods;

**Deva** = **yajamāna**
