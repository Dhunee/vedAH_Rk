## English translation:

“These, your children, the performers of good works, and of goodly appearance, recognize you as their great parents, through experience of former (kindness); preserve uninterrupted stability in the functions of your progeny, whether stationary or moving, (depending for existence) on none other than you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

On none other than you: advayāvinaḥ = having no second parent or protector, no other to depend upon for subsistence
