## English translation:

“Those provident and intelligent sisters, (the rays of light), conceived of the same womb, (ever) united (with each other), and dwelling in the same abode, metre out (all things); knowing (their functions), and bright-shining, they spread in ever new (directions) throughout the radiant firmament.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The epithets are to agree with te, they two;but some epithers are in plural ra, not the dual: te māyinaḥ supracetasaḥ, kavayaḥ sudītyaḥ; some are in the dual: sayoni, samokasā; the plural rals seem to imply another substantive: raśmayaḥ, rays of light: e.g., supracetasaḥ = prakarṣeṇa cetitum śaktā raśmayaḥ, rays able distinctly to apprehend; sudītayaḥ udyotanāḥ, raśmayaḥ, rising rays; the dual s are consistently referred to 'heaven and earth': samokasā, both dwelling together in the same space: dyu pṛthivyor ekasmin nevā vakāśarūpe ākāśe avasthānāt
