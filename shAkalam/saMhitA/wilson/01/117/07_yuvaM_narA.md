## English translation:

“You restored, leaders (of sacrifices), Viṣṇāpu (his lost son) to **Viśvaka**, the son of **Kṛṣṇa**, when he praised you; you bestowed, **Aśvins**, a husband upon **Ghoṣā**, growing old and tarrying inher father's dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ghoṣā was the daughter of **Kakṣīvat**; she was a leper, and therefore, unfit to be married; but when advanced in years, she prayed to the Aśvins, who healed her leprosy and restored her to youth and beauty, so that she obtained a husband
