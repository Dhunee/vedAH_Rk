## English translation:

“(Desiring) that the enjoyment (arising from the perfection) of the senses (should be restored to the blind), the she-wolf invoked you, (saying), "**Aśvins**, showerers (of benefits), leaders (of sacrifices), **Ṛjrāśva**, (lavish) as a youthful gallant, (has given me) a hundred and one sheep, cutting them into fragments".”
