## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, causing the barley to be sown (in the fields that had been prepared) by the plural ugh; milking (the clouds) for the sake of **Manu**; destroying the **Dasyu** with the thunderbolt; you have bestowed brilliant light upon the **Ārya**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Āryāya: viduṣe, to the sage, that is to Manu;

**Manuṣa** = Manu
