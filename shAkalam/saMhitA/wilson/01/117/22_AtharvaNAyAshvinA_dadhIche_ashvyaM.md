## English translation:

“You replaced, **Aśvins**, with the head of a horse, (the head of) Dadhyañc, the son of **Atharvan**, and, true to his promise, he revealed to you the mystic knowledge which he had learned from **Tvaṣṭā**, and which was as a ligature of the waist to you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tvaṣṭā = **Indra**; the knowlege was kakṣyam. vām = a girdle to you both; strengthening them to perform religious rites
