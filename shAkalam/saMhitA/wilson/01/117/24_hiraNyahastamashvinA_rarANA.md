## English translation:

“Liberal **Aśvins**, leaders (of sacrifices), you gave to Vadhṛmati her son **Hiraṇyahasta**; bounteous Aśvins, you restored to life the triply-mutilated **Śyāva**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śyāva was cut into three pieces by the **asuras**; the pieces were reunited into one by the Aśvins
