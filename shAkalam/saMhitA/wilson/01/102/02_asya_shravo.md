## English translation:

“The seven rivers display his glory; heaven, and earth, and sky display his visible form; the sun and moon, **Indra**,perform their revolution, that we may see, and have faith in what we see.”

Ahi and **Vṛtra** are differently-formed clouds. **Rauhina** = an **asura**, possibly, a red cloud
