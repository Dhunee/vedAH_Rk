“**Indra**, in whatsoever rite (the priests) from of old have plural ced the brilliant (sacrificial) food for you upon the altar, in that plural ce of sacrifice you abide; do you declare what (rite), that men may thence behold the intermediate (firmament bright) with the rays (of the sun); for this, Indra, the searcher (of rain, is) the searcher after cattle, for (the benefit of) his kindred (worshippers), and knows in due course (the season of the rain).”
