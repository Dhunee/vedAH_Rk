## English translation:

“(Possessed of) former opulence, **Maghavan**, (through your bounty); protected, **Indra**, by you, may we overcome those who are arrayed in (hostile) hoste; may we anticipate (our) assailants. (The sacrifice) of today being nigh, speak encouragingly to the presenter of the libation; may we bring together at this rite (suitable offerings and praises) to you, the victor in war; worshipping you, the victor in war.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bhare kṛtam = saṅgrāme jayasya kartāram; **bhara** iti saṅgrāmanāma, bharatervā haratervā (**Nirukta** 4.24)
