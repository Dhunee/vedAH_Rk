## English translation:

“Your exploits, **Indra**, are worthy to be glorified; now, verily, as well as in former times, when you did open the cloud for the **Aṅgirasas**, restoring to them their cattle--conquer for us, fight for us, as you did for them; humble in behalf of those who present libations, him who offers no worship; him who rages against us, and offers no worship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vrajam = a cloud; in the second repetition, the cattle of the Aṅgirasas, stolen by **Paṇi**; hence, vrajam = a cow-pen or pasture
