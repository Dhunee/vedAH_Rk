## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Parvata**, who are foremost in battles, slay every one who is arrayed against us; slay every such (adversary) with the thunderbolt--(the shaft that) bent upon his destruction pursues him, however far, or to whatever hiding plural ce he may have fled. You, hero, (tear) our enemies entirely to pieces; the tearer (of foes, the thunderbolt), rends them entirely asunder.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parvata = a cloud, or the deity presiding over clouds, another form of Indra
