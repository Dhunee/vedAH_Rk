## English translation:

“Inasmuch as the hero (**indra**), rightly judges men by their deeds, therefore do the (pious), sacrificing (to him) for sustenance, become enabled, by the wealth that has been attained, to overcome (their foes); desirous of food, they diligently worship (him); the (sacrificial) food offered to him in the source of progeny (to the worshipper), and (men) worship him, that by their own strength they may overcome (their foes); pious sacrificers enjoy residence in the heaven of Indra; pious sacrificers are, as it were, in the presence of the gods.”
