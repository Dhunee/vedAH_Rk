## English translation:

“Go, **Indra**, to the mighty rain-shedding leaders (of the clouds), and exert yourself in (thine) aerial dwelling; for their broad-footed steeds stand (firm), like the manly energies of an enemy in the field of battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the manly energies: tīrthe **nāryaḥ** pauṃsyāni tasthuḥ: **ārya** = areḥ, śatroḥ, of an enemy;

Tīrthe = yuddhamārge, the way of battle; another rendering: the broad-based, dark-coloured clouds stand like the manly armies of a prince, svāminaḥ, on the royal road, **rājā** vithyām
