## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, quickly grant us that wealth (which you possess, for we gratify) the donor with a most worthy present; we, your praisers, offer to you, the ready giver of boons, the laudations that would propitiate you; (and the priests) nourish you with sacrificial food, as they cherish the bosom (of a feminine le for the sakeof replenishing it) with sweet (milk).”
