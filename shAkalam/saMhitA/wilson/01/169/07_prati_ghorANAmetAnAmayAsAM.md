## English translation:

“The noise of the formidable, dark-coloured, swift-moving and advancing **Maruts**, is everywhere echoed; (the noise) of them who strike down their mortal (foes) gathering in a host against them, by their self-defending blows, as (they strike down) a contemptible enemy.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛnāvānam = a contemptible enemy; it may imply a debtor, as if the cloud was debtor to the winds for its contents
