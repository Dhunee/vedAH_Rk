## English translation:

“We invoke, **Indra**, whether he come from this earthly region, or from the heaven above, or from the vast firmament; that he may give (us) wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Either the **pṛthivī**-**loka** or the dyu-loka (heaven); **antarikṣa**-loka = sphere of the firmament (space between the earth and heaven, perhaps = **vyoman** or **ākāśa**, sky or atmosphere)(**Manu**, I.13)
