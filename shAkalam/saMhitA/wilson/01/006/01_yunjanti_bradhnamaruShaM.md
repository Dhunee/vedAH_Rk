## English translation:

“The circumstationed (inhabitants of the **three worlds**) associate with (**Indra**), the mighty (Sun), the indestructive (fire), the moving (wind), and the lights that shine in the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Paritasthuṣaḥ, those who are standing around; or, lokatrayavarttinaḥ **prāṇinaḥ**, the living beings of the three worlds;

Vradhna = mighty (**Āditya**);

Aruṣa = non-injuring (fire);

Caran = moving (wind). **Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** endorses the equivalence: Āditya, **Agni**, **Vāyu** (asau vā, ādityo vradhnaḥ; agnir vā aruṣaḥ; vāyurvai caran) (3.9.4.1-2); identification of Indra with the three epithets implies his supremacy: paramaiśvaryayukta
