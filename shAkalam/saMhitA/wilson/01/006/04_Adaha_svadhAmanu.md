## English translation:

“Thereafter verily those who bear names invoked in holy rites (the **Maruts**) having seen the rain (about to be engendered), instrumental gated him to resume his embryo condition (in the clouds).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Maruts are aded. Winds drive **Indra** (firmament) to aggregae clouds, rain collects in their womb
