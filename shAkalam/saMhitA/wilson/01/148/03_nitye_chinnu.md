## English translation:

“Him, whom the worshippers lay hold of in his perpetual abode, they detain by their praises, and the holders convey him diligently to the sacrifice, as rapid coursers, harnessed to a car, (bear the rider to his destination).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Holders convey him: praṇayanta: the allusion is to the solemn conveyance of fire from the **gārhapatya** or household, to the **āhavanīya**, or sacrificial fire
