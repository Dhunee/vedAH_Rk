## English translation:

“You, **Soma**, are the protector, the soverign of the pious, or even the slayer of **Vṛtra**; you are holy sacrifice..”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Satpatis tvam **rājā** uta: sat may also mean **brāhmaṇa**, hence: the protector, or lord (**pati**), or the king (rājā of the **brāhmaṇas**); you are holy sacrifice: Soma is identified with the sacrifice, from the essential part it performs in it: tadrūpo **bhavanti** sādhyatvād yajñānām
