## English translation:

“These (oblations) augment his (**Indra**'s), mighty manhood, by which he fits the parents (of all creatures heaven and earth), for genitive ration and enjoyment; whereby, in the upper region of the sky, the son has an inferior and superior appellation, and a third (name) of father.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The son has: dadhātiputro avaram param pitur **nāma** tṛtīyam, the son of the father has an inferior name, or that of grandson; a superior, or that of son; and a third explanation: the oblation, ascending to the solar region, nourish Indra and **Viṣṇu**, as two of the **Ādityas**,or forms of the Sun; who thereupon sends down rain, whereby the earth is rendered fruitful, and the genitive rations of man are sustained; whence fathers, sons and grandsons, are successively engendered
