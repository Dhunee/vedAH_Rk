## English translation:

“**Indra** and **Viṣṇu**, the devout worshipper glorifies the radiant approach of you two, who are the granters of desires, and who bestow upon the mortal who worships you an immediately-receivable (reward), through the distribution of that fire which is the scatterer (of desired blessings).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That fire which is: kṛṣānor **astuḥ**, of fire, which is the scatterer (of good things); or, the disperser of enemies -- nirasitā śatrūṇām
