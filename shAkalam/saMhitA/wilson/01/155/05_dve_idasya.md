## English translation:

“Man glorifying (**Viṣṇu**), tracks two steps of that heaven-beholding (deity), but he apprehends not the third; nor can the soaring-winged birds (pursue it).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

But he apprehends not the third: his path on earth and in the firmament iw within mortal observation; not so that in heaven; the soaring-winged birds: vayaścana patayanta patatriṇaḥ; the first two are the everywhere-going **Maruts**;

Patatriṇaḥ = **garuḍa**, and other brids, or the winds
