## English translation:

“Quickly quaffing the libations, and devouring the grateful viands (presented) at the three (daily) sacrifices which are dedicated to the creator (of the world), he, the pervadere of the universe, stole the ripe (treasures of the **asuras**); the vanquisher (of his foes), the hurler of the thunderbolt, encountering pierced the cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Viṣṇu** = pervader, an epithet applied to **Indra**, sarvasya jagato **vyāpakaḥ**. Cloud = **varāha**. Viṣṇu is the person nified **yajña**; he attracted the accusative ulated wealth of the asuras; then, he remained concealed behind seven difficult passes, or the days of initiatory preparation for the rite. Indra crossed the seven defiles or went through the seven days of initiation and pierced the sacrifice. **Taittirīya** expands this further: Varāha, the stealer of what is beautiful, cherishes beyond the seven hills, the wealth of the asuras; Indra, having taken up the tufts of grass, and pierced the seven hills, slew him: varāhoyam vamamoṣaḥ saptānam giriṇām parastād vittam vedyam asurāṇām bibharti; sa darbhapiñjulam uddhṛtya, sapta girin bhitvā, tam ahanniti
