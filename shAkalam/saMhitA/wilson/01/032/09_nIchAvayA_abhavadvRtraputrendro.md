## English translation:

“The mother of **Vṛtra** was bending over her son, when **Indra** struck her nether part with his shaft; so the mother was above and the son underneath, and **Dānu** slept (with her son), like a cow with its calf.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dānu derived from do, to cut or destroy or from Dānu wife of **Kāśyapa** and mother of the **Dānavas** or Titans
