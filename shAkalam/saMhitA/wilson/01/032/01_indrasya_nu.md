## English translation:

“I declare the former valorous deeds of **Indra**, which the thunderer has achieved; he clove the cloud; he cast the waters down (to earth); he broke (a way) for the torrents of the mountain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Vṛtra**, also called Ahi, is alluded to as condensed accusative ulation of vapour figuratively **shut** up or obstructed by a cloud; Indra, with his thunderbolt or atmospheric prowess divides up the augmented mass yielding a vent for the rain to descend on the earth and moisten the fields
