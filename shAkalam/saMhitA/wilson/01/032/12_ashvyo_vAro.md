## English translation:

“When the single resplendent **Vṛtra** returned the blow (which had been inflicted), **Indra**, by your thunderbolt, you became (furious), like a horse's tail. You have rescued the kine; you have won, Hero, the **Soma** juice; you have let loose the seven rivers to flow.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a horse's tail, as a horse lashes his tail to get rid of the flies; seven rivers: **gaṅgā**, **yamunā**, **sarasvatī**, śatudrī, paruṣṇī (**irāvatī**), **asikni**, **marudvṛdhā**, **vitastā**, ārjīkīya (**vipāsā**) and **suṣomā** (**sindhu**)
