## English translation:

“When fear entered, **Indra**, into your heart when about to slay Ahi, what other destroyer of him did you look for, that, alarmed, you did traverse ninety and nine streams like a (swift) hawk?”

When fear entered Indra: his fear was the uncertainty whether he should destroy **Vṛtra** or not
