## English translation:

“The arrogant **Vṛtra**, as if unequaled, defied **Indra**, the mighty hero, the destroyer of many, the scatterer of foes; he has not escaped the contact of the fate (Indra's) enemies. The foe of Indra has crushed the (banks of the) rivers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rujānāḥ pipiṣe, he has ground the rivers or broken down the banks of the rivers, signifying the fall of Vṛtra
