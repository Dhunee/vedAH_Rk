## English translation:

“When, **Aśvins**, you harness your bounty-shedding chariot, refresh our strength with trickling honey; bestow (abundant) food upon our people; may we acquire riches in the strife of heroes.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With trickling honey: madhunā ghṛtena: **madhu** iti udakanāma (**Nirukta** 1.12.11), madhu may be an adjective for **madhura**, sweet, with sweet water; or, it may be a substantive for **amṛta**, ambrosia, with trickling nectar; or, it may just be honey, in the context of the next hymn where the chariot of the Aśvins is termed madhuvāhana, honey-bearing; upon our people: asmākam **brahma** pṛtanāsu: **pṛtanā** = **manuṣya** (pṛtanā iti manuṣyanāma--- Nirukta 2.3.25); i.e., children and dependants. **Brahmā** = **anna**, food
