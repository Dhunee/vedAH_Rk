## English translation:

“**Agni** is awakened upon earth; the Sun rises; the spreading dawn, exhilarating (all) by her radiance, has dispersed (the darkness); harness, (therefore), **Aśvins** your chariot, to come (to the sacrifice), that the divine **Savitā** may animate allbeings to (the performance of) their several (duties).”
