## English translation:

“Glorify the three-headed, seven-rayed **Agni**, who is sibject to no diminution, seated on the lap of his parents, (heaven and earth); and gratifying all (desires); as the universal radiance of the divine (Agni), whether moving or stationary, (spreads around).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three-headed: a reference to three daily sacrifices, or the three household fires, or the three regions, heaven, earth and mid-air; the seven-rayed Agni: the seven flames of fire; or, **raśmi**, a ray = reign or rule, a possible reference to the seven **chandas** (metres) of the **Vedas**
