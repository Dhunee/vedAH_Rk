## English translation:

“(there are) two well-disposed cows together approaching their common progeny, and fully nourishing (him); pointingout the paths that are free from all that is to be avoided, and possessing more than the great intelligence (necessary for his development).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Two well-disposed cows: either the instrumental tutor of the rite and the ministering priest, or the sacrificer and his wife: the **vatsa** calf, or offspring, is **Agni**; and possessing more: viśvān ketān **adhi** maho **dadha**-ne: **keta** = knowledge; sarvāṇi prajñāni pravardhanaviṣayāṇi, having for their object the augmentation of all sorts of wisdom of the highest description
