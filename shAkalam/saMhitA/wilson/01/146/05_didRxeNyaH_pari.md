## English translation:

“He is willing to be seen in the (ten) regions (of space); the victorious, the adorable, the source of life to great and small; inasmuch as in many plural ces the opulent (possessor of sacrificial food), who is visible to all, is the parent of that (pious) progeny.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That pious progeny: the priests are considered the offspring of **Agni**, as they derive their character from the performance of his worship
