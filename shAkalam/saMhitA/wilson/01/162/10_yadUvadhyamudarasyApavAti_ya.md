## English translation:

“Whatever undigested grass fall from this belly; whatever particle of raw flesh may remain; let the immolators make the whole free from defect, and so cook the pure (offering) that it may be perfectly dressed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Particle: gandhan = **leśaḥ**, a little part; may be perfectly dressed: medham śṛtapākam pacantu = let them cook the pure flesh with perfect cooking; i.e. make it fit for the gods, and not done toomuch or toolittle, as may be fit for **pitṛs** and men
