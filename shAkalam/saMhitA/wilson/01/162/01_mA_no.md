## English translation:

“Let neither **Mitra** nor **Varuṇa**, **Aryaman**, Āyu, **Indra**, **Ṛbhukṣin**,nor the **Maruts**, censure us; when we proclaim in the sacrifice the virtus of the swift horse sprung from the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Āyu = **vāyu** (āyuḥ satatagantā **vāyuḥ**, vakāralopo vā);

Ṛbhukṣin = Indra; but,here **Prajāpati**, he in whom the **ṛbhus**,or the **devas**, abide (kṣiyanti); sprung from the gods: **devaja**-tasya = born as the type of various divinities, who are identified with different parts (e.g. uṣā vā **aśvasya** medhyasya **śiraḥ**: **Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad** 1.1.1);

Legend: the horse's origin from the sun, either direct, or through the agency of the **Vasus**: surād aśvam vasavo nirataṣṭa
