## English translation:

“When they, (the priests), bring the prepared offering to the presence (of the horse), who has been bathed and decorated with rich (trappings), the various-coloured goat going before him, bleating, becomes an acceptable offering to **Indra** and **Pūṣan**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The prepared offering: rātim-gṛbhītām = lit. the seized wealth; the offering to be made for the horse;

Pūṣan = **Agni**; the goat is to be tied to the front of the horse at the sacrificial **post**, such a goat, black-necked, kṛṣnagrīva (**āgneyaḥ** kṛṣṇagrīvaḥ: **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 5.5.22), being always regarded as an **āgneya** **paśu**, or victim sacred to Agni, and to be offered to him (**Kātyāyana** **Sūtra** 98). A black goat is also dedicated to pūṣan, along with **soma** (**Yajus**. xxix.58; but, he is also to be attached to the **nābhi** or middle of the horse (Yajus. xxiv.1)
