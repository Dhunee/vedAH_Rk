## English translation:

“The axe penetrates the thirty-four ribs of the swift horse; the beloved of the gods, (the immolators), cut up (the horse) with skill, so that the limbs may be unperforated, and recapitulating joint by joint.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thirty-four ribs: it is noted that other animals have only 24 ribs;

Unperforated: acchidrā **gātrā**: the **viśasana** **kartāraḥ**, or dissectors, are to utter the name of the parts, as heart, tongue,breast, as they divide them; and are to so separate them that they may not have holes or perforations, they may not be mangled
