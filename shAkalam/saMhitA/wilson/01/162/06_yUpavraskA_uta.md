## English translation:

“Whether they be those who cut the (sacrificial) **post**, or those who bear the post, or those who fasten the rings on the top of the post, to which the horse (is bound); or those who prepare the vessels in which the food of the horse is dressed; let the exertions of them all fulfil our expectation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The post: twenty-one **posts**, of different kinds of wood, each twenty-one cubits long, are to be set up, to which the different animals are to be fastened, amounting to three hundred and forty-nine, besides two hundred and sixty wild animals, making a total of six hundred and nine (**Kātyāyana**); the text seems to refer to a single post: caṣālam ye aśvayūpāya takṣati: caṣāla = a wooden ring, or bracelet, on the top of the sacrificial post; or, it was perhaps a metal ring at the foot of the post
