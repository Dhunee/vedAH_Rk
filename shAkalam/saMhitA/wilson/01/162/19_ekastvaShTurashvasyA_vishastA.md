## English translation:

“There is one immolator of the radiant horse, which is Time; there are two that hold him fast; such of your limbs as I cut up in due season, I offer them, made into balls (of meat) upon the fire.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Time: ṛtuḥ, properly season; by metonymy, time; there are two: day and night, or heaven and earth
