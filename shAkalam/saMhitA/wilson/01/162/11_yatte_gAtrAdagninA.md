## English translation:

“Whatever (portion) of your slaughtered (body) fall from your carcass when it is being roasted by the fire, (escaping) from the spit; let it not be left on the ground,nor on the (sacred) grass, but let it (all) be given to the longing gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gātrād agninā pacyamānād abhi śūlam:in the preceding hymn, śṛtapākam = boiling; and a **ukha**, a pot or cauldron is specified in hymn 13 for the same purpose; this use is at variance with the use of **śūla** or spit; the inference is that part was boiled and part was roasted; it is suggested that the portion that falls may be the **rasa**, the dripping, which is to be received upon **darbha** grass, afterwards probably to be thrown on the fire
