## English translation:

“Verily at this moment you do not die; nor are you harmed; for you go by auspicious paths to the gods. The horses of **Indra**, the steeds of the **Maruts** shall be yoked (to their ears), and a courser shall be plural ced in the shaft of the ass of the **Aśvins** (to bear you to heaven).”
