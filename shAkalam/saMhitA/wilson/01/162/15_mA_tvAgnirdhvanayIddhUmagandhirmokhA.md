## English translation:

“Let not smoke-smelling **Agni** cause you, (horse), to utter sound; let not the glowing cauldron, odoriferous (with its contents), be overturned; the gods accept a horse that has been selected (for sacrifice); that has been led (round the fire); that has been devoutly offered, and has been consecrated by (the exclamation), vaṣat.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Let not: this may be addressed to the horse before the horse is killed; or, to the horse's limbs in process of cooking, to desire them not to boil too loud, that is, too fast, lest the fire split the cauldron;

Odoriferous: jaghriḥ tapena jighrati, smellling with heat
