## English translation:

“(Your worshipper) has prepared ground (for tha altar), free from defect, radiant (with sacrificial fire), and conferring heaven; come to it together every day, you who are vigilant; every day (at sacrifices) receive invigorated energy (by coming hither), sons of **Aditi**, lords of munificence; of those two, **Mitra** is the animator of mankind, and so is **Varuṇa**; **Aryaman** (likewise) is the animator of mankind.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The animator of mankind: yātayaj-**janaḥ**, by whom men are being impelled to exertion, or incited to the discharge of their respective functions; as applied to Aryaman, in the repetition, it may imply one by whom the irreligious, or those not performing religious worship, may be cast into the infernal regions, yātyāmānaḥ nipatyamānaḥ narake
