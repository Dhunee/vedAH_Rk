## English translation:

“May this **Soma** be gratifying to **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, to be enjoyed by them as they drink of it inclining downwards; a divine (beverage), fit to be enjoyed by the gods; may all the gods, well plural ased, today accept it; therefore, royal (deities), do as we request; you, who are ever truthful, do as we request.”
