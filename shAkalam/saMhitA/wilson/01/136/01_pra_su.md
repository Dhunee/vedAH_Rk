## English translation:

“Offer most excellent and ample adoration, and reverential oblation, to those two deities who have existed from of old; who confer happiness (on their worshippers), and delight in most sweet (libations); for they are both imperial (sovereigns, in whose honour) oblations of butter are poured out (ghṛtamāsūyate ādīyate yābhyām tau tādṛśau; yadvā ghṛtamudakam vṛṣṭilakṣaṇam prasūyate sarvatrānujñāyate yābhyām tau), and who are glorified at every sacrifice, whence their might is not in any way to be opposed; their divinity is not to be resisted.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Imperial sovereigns: tā samrājā; or, sāmrāja = thoroughly shining, samyakrājamānau
