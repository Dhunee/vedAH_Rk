## English translation:

“I proclaim veneration to the mighty Sun, to heaven and earth, to **Mitra**, to the benevolent **Varuṇa**, to the conferer of happiness, the showerer of benefits. Praise **Indra**, **Agni**, the brilliant **Aryaman**, and **Bhaga**, so that enjoying long life, we may be blessed with progeny; we may be happy through the protecting virtues of the **Soma**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Varuṇāya mīḷhuṣe sumṛḷīkāya mīḷhuṣe:The first attributive is an epithet of **Rudra**, the showerer of desired benefits, abhimataphalasya sektre; the two next words are applied to Mitra, Varuṇa and Rudra\].
