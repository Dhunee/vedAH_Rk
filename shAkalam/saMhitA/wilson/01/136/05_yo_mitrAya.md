## English translation:

“Whatever individual offers adoration to **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, do you preserve him entirely unharmed from sin; (preserve) from sin the mortal who presents you (with oblations); may **Aryaman** protect him who is sincere in his devotion, who offers worship addressed to both (Mitra and Varuṇa) with prayers; who offers worship with praises.”
