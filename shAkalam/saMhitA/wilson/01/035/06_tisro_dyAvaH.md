## English translation:

“Three are the spheres; two are in the proximity of **Savitā**, one leads men to the dwelling of **Yama**. The immortal (luminaries) depend upon Savitā as a car upon the pin of the axle; let him who knows (the greatness of Savitā) declare it.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Amṛta** = immortals; moon and constellations are added
