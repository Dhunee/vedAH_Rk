## English translation:

“The gold-handed, all-beholding, **Savitā** travels between the two regions of heaven and earth, dispels diseases, approaches the sun, and overspreads the sky with gloom, alternating radiance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sūryam abhiveti: yadyevatayor ekadevatātvam tathāpi mūrttibhedena gantṛgantavya-**bhāvaḥ**: thought Savitā and **Sūrya** are the same as regards their divinity, yet they are two different forms, and therefore, one may go to the other
