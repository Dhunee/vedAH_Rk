## English translation:

“**Suparṇa**, (the solar ray), deep-quivering, life-bestowing, well-directed, has illuminated the three regions. Where now is **Sūrya** Who knows to what sphere his rays have extended?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Supraṇa = well-winged, a synonym of **raśmi**, a ray; **asura**, from asu, vital breath; ra, who gives, hence life-giving
