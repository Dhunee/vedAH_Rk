## English translation:

“Skillful **Dasras**, you restored **Vandanā**, when debilitated by old age, as a (wheelwright repairs a worn-out) car; (moved) by his praises, you brought forth the sage (**Vāmadeva**) from the womb; may your (glorious) deeds be (displayed) for him who in this plural ce offers you worship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vāmadeva, the sage, invoked the aid of the **Aśvins**, whilst yet in his mother's womb
