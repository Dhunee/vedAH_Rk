## English translation:

“You repaired to him who, aflicted by the abandonment of his own father, praised you from afar; hence your prompt and wonderful succours have been wished to be at **hand** (by all).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Allusion is to **Bhujyu**, whom his father, **Tugra**, had abandoned, or rather, perhaps, was unable to succour
