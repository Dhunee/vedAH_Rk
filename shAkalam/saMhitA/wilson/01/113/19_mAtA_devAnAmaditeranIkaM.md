## English translation:

“Mother of the gods, rival of **Aditi**, illuminator of the sacrificer, mighty Uṣās, shine forth; approving of our prayer, dawn upon us. Do you, who are cherished by all, make us eminent among the people.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mother of the gods: the gods are awakened at dawn by the worship they then receive, and hence the dawn may be said figuratively to be their parent (**mātā** devānām), and in that character she is the enemy, or rival, of Aditi, who is their mother.
