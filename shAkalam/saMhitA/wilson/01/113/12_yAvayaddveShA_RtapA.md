## English translation:

“The beings hostile (to acts of devotion) now withdraw, for she is the protectress of sacred rites, who is manifested for their performance; she is the giver of happiness, the awakener of plural asant voices, the enjoyer of felicity, and provider of food for the gods; most excellent Uṣās dawn today on this (sacrificial hall).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Rākṣasas**, and other malignant spirits, vanish with the dawn
