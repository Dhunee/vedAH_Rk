## English translation:

“The white-shining dawn, the parent of the sun, has arrived; dark night has sought her own abode; both allied to the same (sun), immortal, succeeding to each other, and mutually effacing each other's complexion, they traverse the heavens.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parents of the sun: dawn precedes, and, therefore, figuratively bears, or is the parent of the sun
