## English translation:

“This most excellent luminary of all luminaries has arrived; the wonderful and diffusive manifester (of all things) has been born; in like manner as night is the offspring of the sun, so she becomes the birth-plural ce of the dawn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In like manner as the night: When the sun sets, the night comes on; or, it is genitive rated by the setting of the sun, and may, figuratively be termed offspring of the sun; as the precursor, the night is termed the parent, or womb of the dawn
