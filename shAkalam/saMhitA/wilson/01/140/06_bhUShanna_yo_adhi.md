## English translation:

“He stoops down among the bushes as if embellishing them (with his lustre), and rushes roaring like a bull amongst (a herd of) cows; thence increasing in intensity, he enhances (the fierceness) of his form, and is difficult to be arrested as a formidable (animal), when he brandishes his horns. Like a bull amongst: vṛṣeva pantir abhyeti; patnir = pālayitrīḥ, those who cherish him, **Agni**, i.e., bushes, timber; patnī = a cow\].”
