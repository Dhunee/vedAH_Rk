## English translation:

“The curving tresses (of the flames) embrace him, (**Agni**), and when expiring spring aloft again to (greet) their coming (lord); rescuing them from decrepitude, he comes sounding aloud, genitive rating (in them) intenser animation and unimpaired vitality.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The curving tresses: agruva **keśinīḥ**;

Agruvaḥ = fingers, as an attributive, implies either those that are in front, agrataḥ **sthitaḥ**, or crooked or curved like fingers
