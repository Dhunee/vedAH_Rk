## English translation:

“(**Agni**), the two-fold genitive rated, devours the triple (sacrificial) food, and when the year expires renovates what has been eaten; the showerer (of benefits) is invigorated (inone form), by eating with the tongue of another; in a different form the restrainer (of) all consumes the forest trees.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Two-fold genitive rated: either as produced by attrition from the two sticks, or first by attrition and second by consecration for sacrificial use; triple-food: trivṛd-**annam**; 1. clarified butter; 2. **puroḍāśa** butter, with other articles or cakes fried in butter; and 3. **soma**; renovates what has been eaten: same articles are offered annually; consumes the forest trees: anyasya-āsā jihvayā jenyo vṛṣānyanyena-**mṛṣṭa** = liṭ, the victorious showerer by the mouth-tongue of another; by another consumes. āsā = asyena, with the mouth;

Anyasya = of the oblation, or with the mouth in one form (or sacrificial fire) he receives the oblation through the tongue of another, i.e. the ladle of the ministering priest; in another form, i.e., the fire that burns forests, dāvāgni, he consumes the trees
