## English translation:

“Both his associated mothers, blackened (by combustion), are in movement, and give birth to an infant, whose tongue (of flame glows) in the east; (who) dissipates darkness; (who) rapidly issues forth; (who) is readily developed; (who) is (ever) to be cherished, and is the augmenter (of the prosperity) of his parent, (the instrumental tutor of the rite).”
