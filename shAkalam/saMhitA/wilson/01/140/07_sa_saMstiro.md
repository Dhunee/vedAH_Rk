## English translation:

“Now hidden, now displayed, he seizes (on the fuel), as if understanding (the purpose of the worshipper), and even reposes amidst the conscious (flames); again they break forth, and repair to the divine (fire of sacrifice), blending with which they give a different (luminous)form to their parents, (heaven and earth).”
