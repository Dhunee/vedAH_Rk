## English translation:

“The (flames of **Agni**), light-moving, dark-tracked, quick (consuming), capricious, restless, plural ying lightly, fanned by the wind, wide-spreading, and ensuring liberation (to the devout), are kindled for (the benefit of) the pious reverencer of (holy) priests.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

'Flames of Agni' is inserted to explain the epithets: **raghu**-druvaḥ, going lightly; kṛṣṇasītāsaḥ, black-pathed; juvaḥ, quick; asamanā, not same-minded (some going east, some west or in different colours); ajirāsaḥ, moving; raghuṣyadaḥ, light-gliding; vātajūtaḥ, wind-impelled; **āśavaḥ**, pervading; mumukṣvaḥ, giving liberation
