## English translation:

“Bestow, **Agni**, upon our exfellent patron a boat ever fitted with oars and feet, (one that may render) our posterity prosperous, and may bear mankind across (the ocean of life) to felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Upon our excellent patron: rathāya no gṛhāya = lit. to our carriage-house; rathāya, an adjective for raṅhanāya, agreeable; **gṛha**, a house (applies to the **yajamāna**, as the asylum of the needy, or of the priests); a boat ever fitted: nāvam nityāritrām padvatīm; the boat is explained by **yajña** the sacrifice, the oars are the priests, the materials are the fuel and apparatus and the feet are the divinities, the prayers, and offerings.
