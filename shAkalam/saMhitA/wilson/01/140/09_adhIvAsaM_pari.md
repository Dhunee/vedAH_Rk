## English translation:

“Licking up the (verdant) vesture of the mother (of all things, earth), the rapid (**Agni**) proceeds with resounding existences; granting sustenance to (every) footed (creature); ever consuming (fuel), so that a blackened track follows (hispath).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Proceeds with resounding existences: tuvigrebhiḥ satvabhiḥ viyāti = he goes variously with living beings, sounding loudly, or going quickly, accompanied by the cries or the flight of animals when he sets fire to a forest;

Footed: padvate = to that which has feet, either bipeds or quadrupeds
