## English translation:

“**Agni**, be propitiated by this our earnest praise, and may heaven and earth, and the spontaneously-flowing (streams), provide for us the produce of the herd, and of the field; and may the purple coursers (of the dawn) bestow upon us abundant food through a length of days.”
