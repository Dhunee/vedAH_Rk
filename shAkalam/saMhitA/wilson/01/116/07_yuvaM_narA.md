## English translation:

“You gave, leaders (of sacrifice), to **Kakṣīvat**, of the race of Pajra, various knowledge; you filled from the hoof of your vigorous steed, as if from a cask, a hundred jars of wine.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pajras = **Aṅgiras**; Kakṣīvat was a descendant of this family
