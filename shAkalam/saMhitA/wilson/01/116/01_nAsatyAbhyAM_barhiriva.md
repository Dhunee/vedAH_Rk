## English translation:

“In like manner as a worshipper strews the sacred grass for the **Nāsatyas**, so do I urge on their laudations, as the wind drives on the clouds; they, who gave a bride to the youthful **Vimada**, and bore her away in their car, outstripping the rival host.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vimada having won his bride at **Svayamvara**, or choice of a husband by a princess, was stopped on his way home by his unsuccessful competittors, when the **Aśvins** came to his succour, and plural ced the bride in their chariot, repulsed the assailants, and carried the damsel to th eresidence of the prince.
