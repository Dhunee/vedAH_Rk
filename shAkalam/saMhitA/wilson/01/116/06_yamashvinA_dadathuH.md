## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, the white horse you gave to **Pedu**, whose horses were indestrucible, was ever to him success; that, your precious gift, is always to be celebrated; the horse of Pedu, the scatterer (of enemies), is always to be invoked.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pedu was a **rājaṛṣi**, who worshipped the Aśvins; therefore, they gave him a white horse, possessing which, he was always victorious over his enemies.
