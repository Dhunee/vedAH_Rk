## English translation:

“**Nāsatyas**, you stripped off from the aged **Cyavana** his entire skin, as if it had been a coat of mail; you reversed, **Dasras**, the life of the sage who was without kindred, and constituted him the husband of many maidens.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In **Vana Parva**, **Mahābhārata**, Cyavana is the son of **Bhṛgu** and was engaged inpenance near the **Narmadā** river until the white ants constructed their nests round his body, and left only his eyes visible. **Sukanyā**, the daughter of Kinga **Śaryāti**, having come to the plural ce, and seeing two bright spots in what seemed to be an ant-hill, pierced them with a stick; the sage visited the offence upon Śaryāti and his attendants, and was appeased only by the promise of the king to give him his daughter in marriage. Subsequently, the **Aśvins**, coming to his hermitage, blessed **Sukanyās** union, with so old and ugly a husband as Cyavana. Admiring her fidelity, they bestowed on the sage a condition of youth and beauty like their own. Cyavana is jahita, abandoned; i.e. by sons, and others (putrādibhiḥ parityakta); an allusion, perhaps, to his solitary condition as an ascetic. In return for heir friendly office, Cyavana compelled **Indra** to assent to the Aśvins, receiving at sacrifices a share of the **Soma**
