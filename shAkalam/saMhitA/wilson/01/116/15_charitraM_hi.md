## English translation:

“The foot of (Vispalā, the wife of) Khela, was cut off, like the wing of a bird, in an engagement by night; immediately you gave her a metallic leg, that she might walk, the hidden treasure (of the enemy being the object of the conflict).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Khela was a king; **Agastya** was his **purohita**. Through his prayers the **Aśvins** gave **Viśalā** a metallic leg
