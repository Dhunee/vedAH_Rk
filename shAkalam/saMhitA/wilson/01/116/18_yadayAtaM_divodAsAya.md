## English translation:

“When, **Aśvins**, being invited, you went to his dwelling (to give due rewards) to **Divodāsa**, offering oblations, then your helping chariot conveyed (food and) treasure, and the bull and the porpoise were yoked together.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The bull and the porpoise: the **Vṛṣabha** and **Śiṃśumāra**. The latter is **a graha**, which is properly an alligator; but the śiṃśumāra is a gangetic porpoise; they were yoked to the car of the Aśvins, to display their power
