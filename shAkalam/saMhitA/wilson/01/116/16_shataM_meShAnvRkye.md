## English translation:

“When his father caused,Ṛjrāśvā, as he was giving to a she-wolf a hundred sheep cut up in pieces, to become blind, you, **Dasras**, physicians (of the gods), gave him eyes (that had been) unable to find their way, with which he might see.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ṛjrāśva** was one of the sons of **Vṛṣāgir**; a she-wolf: **vṛkā** was one of the asses of the **Aśvins** in disguise, to test his charitable disposition; but, as he exacted the sheep from the people, his father was angry, and caused him to lose his eyesight, which the Aśvins restored to him
