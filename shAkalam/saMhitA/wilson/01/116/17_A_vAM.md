## English translation:

“The daughter of the sun ascended your car, (like a runner) to a goal; when you won (the race) with your swift horse, all the gods looked on with (anxious hearts), and you, **Nāsatyas**, were associated with glory.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Sūrya** was desirous of giving his daughter Sūrya to **Soma**, but all the gods desired her as a wife; they agreed that he who should first reach the sun, as a goal should wed the damsel. The **Aśvins** were victorious, and Sūrya, well plural ased by their success, rushed immediately into their chariot
