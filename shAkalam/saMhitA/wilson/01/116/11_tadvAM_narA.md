## English translation:

“**Nāsatyas**, leaders, glorious was that exploit of yours, one to be celebrated, to be adored, to be desired by us, when, becoming aware (of the circumstance), you extricated **Vandanā**, (hidden), like a concealed treasure, from the (well) that was visible (to travellers).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Darśatāt, well, i.e. that which was to be seen by thirsty travellers
