## English translation:

“I proclaim, leadeers (of sacriifce), for the skae of acquiring wealth, that inimitable deed which you performed, as the thunder (announces) rain, when provided by you with the head of a horse. Dadhyañc, the son of **Atharvan**, taught you the mystic science.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend: **Vana Parva**, **Mahābhārata**: gods, being oppressed by the **Kālakeya** **asuras**, solicited from the sage **Dadhica** his bones, which he gave them, and from which **Tvaṣṭā** fabricated the thunderbolt with which **Indra** slew **Vṛtra** and routed the asuras. The text: Indra, having taught the science called **pravargya** **vidyā** and **madhu-vidyā** to Dadhyañc, threatened that he would cut off his head if ever he taught them to any one else; the **Aśvins** prevailed upon him, nevertheless, to teach them the prohibited knowledge, and, to evade Indra's threat, took off the head of the sage, replacing it by that of a horse; Indr, apprised of Dadhyañc's breach of faith, sturck off his equine head with the thunderbolt; on which, the Aśvins restored to him his own. The pravargya vidyā is said to imply certain verses of the ṛk, yajur and **sāma vedas**, and the **madhu**-vidyā the **Brāhmaṇa**
