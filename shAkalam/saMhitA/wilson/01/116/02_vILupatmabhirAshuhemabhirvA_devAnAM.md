## English translation:

“**Nāsatyas**,borne by strong and rapid (steeds), and (urged) by the encouragements of the gods, the ass of you, thus instrumental gated, overcame a thousand (enemies) in conflict, in the war grateful to **Yama**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The ass: An ass (**rāsabha**) given by **Prajāpati**. The chariot of the **Aśvins** is drawn by two asses (rāsabhavaśvinoḥ) (**Nighaṇṭu** 1.14); or, it may mean, 'one going swiftly', and the rest of the passage, 'obtained precedence for the Aśvins over other gods in the oblation, through his mastering the stanzas declared by Prajāpati'
