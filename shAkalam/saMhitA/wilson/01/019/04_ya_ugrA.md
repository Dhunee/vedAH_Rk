## English translation:

“Who are fierce, and send down rain (**arka**, from arc to worship; āpo vā **arkaḥ** (**Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa** 10.6.5.2); hence, arka connotes water or rain), and are unsurpassed in strength; come, **Agni** with the **Maruts**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

So arcannacarat tasyārcataḥ āpo ajāyanta: **Hiraṇyagarbha** proceeded, worshipping, (after creating the solid earth), and from him worshipping the waters were produced (**Śatapatha** **Brāhmaṇa** 10.6.5.1)
