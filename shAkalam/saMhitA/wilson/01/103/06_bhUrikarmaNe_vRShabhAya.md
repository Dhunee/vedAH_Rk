## English translation:

“We offer the **Soma** libation to him who is the performer of many exploits, the best (of the gods), the showerer (of benefits), the possessor of true strength, the hero who, holding respect for wealth, takes it from him who performs no sacrifice, like a foot-pad (from a traveller), and proceeds (to give it) to the sacrificer.”
