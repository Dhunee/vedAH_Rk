## English translation:

“When the search was set on foot by **Indra** and the **Aṅgirasas**, Suramā secured food for her young; then **Bṛhaspati** slew the devourer and rescued the kine, and the gods, with the cattle, proclaimed their joy alouḍ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Saramā** agreed with Indra to go in search of the stolen cattle on condition that the milk of the cows should be given to her young ones. Bṛhaspati = Indra, the master of the great ones (bṛhatam), the gods
