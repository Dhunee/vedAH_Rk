## English translation:

“From a remote time the contiguous, unshifting, and unwearied fingers practise with (all) their energies many thousand acts of devotion (towards **Indra**); and like the wives (of the gods), the protecting sisters worship him who is without shame.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Panīḥ **svasāraḥ** = the protecting or propitiatory and moving epithets of **avaniḥ**, fingers; janayo na = like wives (i.e., of the gods, devānām)
