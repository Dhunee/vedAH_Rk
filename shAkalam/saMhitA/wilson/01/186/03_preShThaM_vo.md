## English translation:

“I praise with hymns, (O gods), your best beloved guest, **Agni**, who is prompt (to partake of the oblation) and who is well plural ased along (with you); so that (thereby) **Varuṇa**, the possessor of renown, the subduer of foes, the animator (of men), may fill us with food.”
