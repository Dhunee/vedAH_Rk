## English translation:

“For our minds, yoked together like horses tend to the ever youthful **Indra**, as cows to their calves; and the praises of men, (addressed) to him, are genitive rating most fragrant (fruit), as wives bear (children to their husbands).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Most fragrant fruit: surabhiṣṭamam = atiśayena surabhim, exceedingly fragrant
