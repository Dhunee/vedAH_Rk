## English translation:

“May, **Ahirbudhnya** grant us happiness; may **Sindhu** come, nourishing us as a (cow her) calf, whereby we may propitiate the grandson of the waters, (**Agni**), whom the clouds, swift as thought, convey.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ahirbudhnya: or, ahir who is also budhnya; ahi and **budhna** = **antarikṣa**; the compound implies a divinity presiding over the firmament; ahirvradhna of the **Purāṇas** is enumerated as one of the **Rudras**; ahirbradhna is the name of **Śiva**
