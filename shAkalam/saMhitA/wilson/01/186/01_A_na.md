## English translation:

“May the divine **Savitā**, the benefactor of all men, come benignantly to our solemnity, together with the divinities of earth, and do you, who are (always) young, willingly present at our sacrifice, exhilarate us, as (you exhilarate) the whole world.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Another interpretation: **viśvānara** = an epithet of Savitā, **viśva nara** hitakāri, the doer of good to all men;

Iḷa = food, yathā sarve irām bhakṣayanti tathā etu; but, iḷābhiḥ **saha** = bhūmisthānābhiḥ devābhiḥ, with the divinities, whose plural ce is earth;

Jagad = **jaṅgama**, moveable, i.e. cattle and offspring
