## English translation:

“Propitiate the **Aśvins** and **Pūṣan**, for my protection; (propitiate) those (deities), who are of independent powers, as **Viṣṇu**, devoid of hatred, **Vāyu** and **Ṛbhukṣin**, and may I influence the gods to be present for my felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who are of independent powers: svatavaso hi **santi** = ye svāyattabalāḥ santi, those who are self-dependent, powerful;

Ṛbhukṣin = **Indra**
