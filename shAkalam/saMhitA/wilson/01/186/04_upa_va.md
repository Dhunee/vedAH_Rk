## English translation:

“I approach you, (deities), with reverence, night and day, in the hope of overcoming (sin), as (willingly), as a genitive tle cow (comes to be milked), mixing (for you) on the appropriate day the (sacrificial) food, (consisting) of multiform (preparations) of milk (genitive rated) from the same udder.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Multiform preparations: viṣurūpe payasi sasminnūdhan = in multiform milk in a common udder; i.e. the manifold water or solution of the **Soma** prepared for the sacrifice; since it yields rewards, it is compared to an udder yielding milk whence butter, **ghee**
