## English translation:

“Or may the **Maruts**, being of one mind, come from heaven and earth (to the sacrifice); they who are a mighty host, who have parti-coloured steeds, who are like protecting chariots, and who are devourers of foes may they come like friendly deities.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like protecting chariots: avanayo na rathāḥ = rakṣakāḥ rathāḥ;

Avanaya = bending, or inclining downwards
