## English translation:

“The fellies are twelve; the wheel is one; three are the axles; but who knows it? within it are collected 360 (spokes), which are, as it were, moveable and immoveable.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The wheel is the year of twelve months; the three axles are the three doubble seasons, or hot, wet and cold; and the three hundred and sixty spokes are the days of the lunar-**solar year**; **stanaḥ** śaśayaḥ, **śayāna**, sleeping; dehe **vartamānaḥ**, abiding in the body
