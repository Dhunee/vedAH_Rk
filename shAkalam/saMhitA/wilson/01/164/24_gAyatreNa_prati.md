## English translation:

“He constructs the prayer with the **gāyatrī** metre; with the prayer (he constructs) the **Soma**, and with the **triṣṭubh** metre the couplet (or triplet); with the couplet (or triplet) he constructs the hymn with (verses of) two or four distichs; and with the syllable they construct the seven metres.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gāyatreṇa parimimīte arkam: he, severally measures the **mantra** with the gāyatrī metre;or, a part being put for the whole, with any Vedic metre; tṛṣṭubhena vākam: **vāka** signifies either dvṛca or tṛca rūpam, the form or phrase of two or three hymns; or, it may imply a **sūkta**; vākena vākam: the first vāka is interpreted as sūkta, when repeated it implies the **varga** or anuvāka; if vāka signifies a couplet or triplet, is may be applicable to the sūkta; akṣarena sapta **vāṇīḥ** = the seven genitive ric metres of the **Veda** with the syllable, the syllable being the chief element of the metre; gāyatrī has eight syllables; trṣṭubh has eleven syllables; **jagatī** has twelve syllables. The classification of the metrical system of the **Vedas** is ascribed to **Brahmā** or the ṛṣis, the priests
