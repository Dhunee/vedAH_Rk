## English translation:

“Those which (the sages) have termed descending, they have also termed ascending; and those they have termed ascending, they have also called descending; and those (orbits) which your, **Soma** and **Indra**, have made, bear along the worlds like (oxen) yoked to a twain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Those which: the rays of light, or the plural nets changing their relative position as they revolve; Soma and Indra: the moon and the sun; Indra is one of the twelve **Ādityas** or identical here with the sun
