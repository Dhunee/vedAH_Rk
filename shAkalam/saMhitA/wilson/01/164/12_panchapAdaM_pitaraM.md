Puriṣin: from **puriṣa**, water;

Puriṣin = the sun, as the source of rain; the first five feet are the five seasons, the dewy and cold seasons forming one; the twelve forms are the twelve months, or twelve **ādityas**;

Arpita = adhīnam or parāyattam, dependent upon, and applicable to the sun, as dependent upon, or influenced by, the course of the year, or recurrence of the solstices; moving quick or slow according to his southern or northern declination; in the hither portion of the sky: upare = where living creatures are delighted--uparamanta asmin **prāṇinaḥ**; or, it may mean a year, vā **saṃvatsaraḥ**; it may be related to the first line of the hymn: **divaḥ** pare ardhe, in the further part of the sky; upara may imply the nearer or hither part, referring to the two **ayanas**, or solstices; the seven wheels are the seven rays, or the seven days of the week, the six spokes are the six seasona
