## English translation:

“They who know the station of **Agni** upon the earth; the station of **Vāyu** that was fabricated from the firmament; and that station of the Sun which is plural ced in heaven, obtain immortality.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Yadgāyatre **adhi** gāyatram traṣṭubhād vā traiṣṭubham: perhaps, a mystical reference to the text of the **Veda**, a knowledge of which is essential to final felicity; **gāyatra** is derived from **gāyatrī** the earth; it is the **pada**, or station of Agni; **traiṣṭubha** is identified with the firmament, and the plural ce of Vāyu; jāgat is identified with the sun: jāgat, the solar region (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.2.9.5-6)
