## English translation:

“I distinguish not if I am this all; for I go perplexed, and bound in mind; when the first-born (perceptions) of the truth reach me, then immediately shall I obtain a portion (of the meaning) of that (sacred) word.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I distinguish not: na vijānāmi yadiva idam asmi: this may be read as: yadi va idam, that I am like that which this is; or, if I am this; in either meaning, the philosophical implication is the identity of individual and universal spirit
