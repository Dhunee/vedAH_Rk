## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In the highest heaven: the sound **gaurī**: clouds or sky, as differently originated; in one station, ekapadī, from the clouds; in two, **dvipadī**, from the clouds and sky; in four, the four quarters of space; in eight, the four points and four intermediate points of the horizon; or from them and the zenith, navapadī, nine-stationed; articulate speech, gaurī: single as the crude form only, double as declension and conjugation, fourfold as nouns, verbs, prepositions and particles; eightfold as the eight cases, including the vocative; and ninefold as the same, with the addition of indeclinable; articulate sound, gaurī: diversified according to the nine parts of the body whence it may be supposed to proceed, navel, chest, throat; the highest heaven is **hṛdaya ākāśa**, ethereal element of the heart, as the basis of speech, mūlādhāre
