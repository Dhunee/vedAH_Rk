## English translation:

“They have called thes, my virtuous feminine les, **males**; he who has eyes beholds; the blind man sees not; he whois a sage son understands this, and he who discriminates is the father of the father.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Males: an instrumental nce of grammatical mysticism: **raśmi**, a ray of the sun, is here person nified as a feminine le, is properly a noun masculine; the father of the father: the sun is to be considered as the father of the rays of light, which are the cause of rain, or the fosterers or parent of the earth; the sun is, therefore, the father of the father, and he who knows this is identical with the sun
