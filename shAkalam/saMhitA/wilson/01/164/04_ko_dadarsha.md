## English translation:

“Who has seen the primeval (being) at the time of his being born; what is that endowed with substance which the unsubstantial sustains; from earth are the breath and blood; but where is the **soul**; who may repair to the sage to ask this?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tha endowed with subtance: asthanvantam yad anasthā bibharti = liṭ, that which having bone the boneless sustains; the boneless is the **prakṛti** of the **sāṅkhya**, or the **māyā** of the vedāntins, which is formless matter, or spiritual illusion, from which the material and visible world proceeds; where is the soul: bhūmyā asur-asṛg-**ātmā** kva svit: **bhūmi** = **sthūla śarīra**, gross body;

Asuḥ = breath, the **sūkṣma śarīra**, or suble body;

**Asṛj** = blood, the aggregate elements of which the body is formed; ātmā or **cetanā**, the thinking principle, although connected with gross and subtle form, is nowhere perceptible as a separate object, and not to be apprehended, either by pupil or teacher
