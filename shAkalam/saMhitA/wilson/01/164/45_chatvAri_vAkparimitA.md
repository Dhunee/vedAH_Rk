## English translation:

“Four are the definite grades of spech; those **Brahmaṇas** who are wise know them; three, deposited in secret, indicate no meaning; men speak the fourth grade of speech.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Four are: catvāri vākparimitā padāni: the language of the **mantras**, the **kalpa**, the **brāhmaṇa** and **laukika**, or current speech (**Taittirīya** Samhitā 1.31.2); those **brāhmaṇas**: brāhmaṇā ye manīṣiṇaḥ: brāhmaṇā = those acquainted with the **śabdabrahma**, **brahma** as the word, or, the **yogis**, mystics; fourth grad eof speech: vāk, speech, was created fourfold, three kinds of which are in the three regions, the fourth amongst the **paśus**; the form on earth, associated with **Agni** is in the **rathantara**; the form in the firmament, associated with **Vāyu**, is in the **Vāmadevya** mantras; that which is in heaven, with **Āditya**, is **Bṛhatī**, or in the thunder (stanayitnau); whatever else was more than this was plural ced amongst the paśus, liṭ, animals; here the brāhmaṇas are implied: **atha** paśuṣu tato yā vāg atiricyate tām brāhmaṇeṣu adaduḥ; thus, the brāhmaṇas speak both languages, that of the gods and that of man (tasmād brāhmaṇā ubharyo vācam vadanti yā ca devānām yā ca manuṣyāṇa(m (**Nirukta** 13.9)
