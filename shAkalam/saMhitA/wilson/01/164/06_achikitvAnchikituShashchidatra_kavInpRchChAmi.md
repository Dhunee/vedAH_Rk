## English translation:

“Ignorant, I inquire of the sages who know (the truth); not as one knowing (do I inquire), for the sake of (gaining) knowledge; what is that one alone, who has upheld these six spheres in the form of the unborn?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

What is that one alone: yas tastambha śad imā rajāṃsi **ajasya** rūpe kim apisvidekam: the 'one' is: 1) the orb of the ungenerated sun on which the six seasons depend; 2) **satyaloka**, whence there is no return, the stay of the other six worlds or regions; 3) the sole form of the unborn creator
