## English translation:

“I have beheld the Lord of men with seven sons; of which delightful and benevolent (deity), who is the object of our invocation, there is an all-pervading middle brother, and a third brother, well fed with (oblations of) **ghee**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Seven sons: seven solar rays; **Āditya**, the seventh son of **Aditi**; a third brother: V_yu and **Agni**, the younger brothers of Āditya: **Parameśvara** = Āditya, the three sons refer to the attributes of Parameśvara of creating, preserving and destroying; The **sūkta** enunciates the doctrines of **vedānta**, the spiritual unity of **Brahmā** and the universe; Āditya or the sun, is glorified aqnd identified with all creation. **Śaunaka** explains the sūkta at the level of repentance for a crime: if a **brāhmaṇa** has committed theft, he may expiate the offence by fasting three nights and repeating the sūkta silently
