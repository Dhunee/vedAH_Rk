## English translation:

“The mother, (sky), was associated in (sustaining) the burden of the fulfiller of desires, (the earth); the embryo (water) rested within the (womb of the) clouds; thereupon the calf bellowed, and beheld the omniform cow in the three combinations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The calf bellowed: the cloud thundered; the omniform cow: viśvarūpyam gām triṣu yojaneṣu = the earth diversified by various crops in consequence of the co-operation of the cloud, the wind, and the rays of the sun
