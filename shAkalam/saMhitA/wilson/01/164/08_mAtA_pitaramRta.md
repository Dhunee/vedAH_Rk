## English translation:

“The mother, (earth), worships the father, (sun), with holy rites, for the sake of water; but he has anticipated (her wants) in his mind; whereupon desirous of progeny, she is penetrated by the dews of impregnation, and, (all) expectant of abundance, exchange words (of congratulation).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Exchange words: metaphocial account of the agency of the sun sending rain upon the earth and its consequent fertility
