## English translation:

“The seven (sustaining), the embryo (rain) for half a year, the fecundating (element) of the world, abide, by appointment, in the various functions of **Viṣṇu**. By their intelligence they pervade in thought all around (them), for they are intelligent and diffusive.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven: the solar rays, saptārdhagarbhāḥ; either retaining the rains for half a year, i.e. during the dry months, or abiding in a part or half of space, or in the mid-heaven or firmament. Viṣṇu is the pervading sun; vyāpakasya Ādityasya, in whose various duties of cherishing the world, the solar rays are, by direction, pradiśā, especially employed
