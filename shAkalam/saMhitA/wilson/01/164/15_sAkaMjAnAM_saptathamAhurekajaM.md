## English translation:

“Of those that are born together, sages have called the seventh single-born; for six are twins, and are moveable, and born of the gods; their desirable (properties), plural ced severally in their proper abode, are various (also) in form, and revolve for (the benefit of) that which is stationary.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Six are twins: six seasons, made of two months each; the seventh is the intercalary month, which has no **āditya** to preside over it; the six seasons are also ṛsi, ṛṣayaḥ = gantāraḥ, goers; a ṛṣi is present in the sun's car in each of the twelve months; revolve for the benefit: the seasons are diversified by classes of temperature, produce, for the benefit of the world
