## English translation:

“Life endowed with breath, eager (in discharge of its functions), reposes, steady, in the midst of its (proper) abodes; the life of the mortal body, cognate with the mortal frame, endures immortal (sustained) by (obsequial) offerings.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By obsequial offerings: svadhābhiḥ **putra** kṛtaiḥ, by offerings made by the sons
