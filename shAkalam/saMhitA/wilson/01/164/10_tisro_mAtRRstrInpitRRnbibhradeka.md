## English translation:

“The one sole (sun), having three mothers and three fathers, stood on high; none ever over-weary him; the (gods) on the summit of the sky take counsel respecting him in language all-comprehending (but) not extending to all.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Three mothers and three fathers: the **three worlds**, earth, sky, heaven; and the three deities presiding over them: **agni**, **vāyu**, **sūrya**; in language: viśvavidam vācam aviśvaminvām = speech or discourse, knowing all, or which may be known by all; or, that which does not extend to all, a-sarvavyāpinīm;

Speech = thunder: vācam garjitalakṣaṇam
