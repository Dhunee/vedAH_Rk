## English translation:

“The heaven is my parent and progenitor; the navel (of the earth) is my kinsman; the spacious earth is my mother. The womb (of all beings) lies between the two uplifted ladles, and in it the parent has deposited the germ (of the fruitfulness) of the daughter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

My parent: nābhir atra **bandhu**: **nābhi** is related to me **pitā** **janitā**, i.e. the moisture of the earth, by which corn is abundant, and which, as derived from the rain of heaven, makes the latter the parent and progenitor of man;

**Bandhuḥ** = bandhikā, binding or supporting; this word is an epithet of **pṛthivī**, the earth; two uplifted ladles: uttānayos' camvor yonir antar: the uplifted ladles are heaven and earth, and the womb of all beings between them is the firmament, the region of the rain; the parent has deposited: the father, the heaven, may be regarded as identical with either **Āditya** or **Indra**; the daughter is the earth, whose fertility depends upon the rain deposited as a germ in the firmament
