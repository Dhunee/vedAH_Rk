## English translation:

“They yoke the seven (horses) to the one-wheeled car; one horse, named seven, bears it along; the three-axled wheel is undecaying, never loosened, and in it all these regions of the universe abide.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

One-wheeled car: either the orb of the sun, or time, or a year; the seven horses may be the seven solar rays,or the six seasons, with their aggregation and year; or the six doublemonths, and the intercalary month; or the seven days of the week; the wheels of the car, as typical and identical are said to be one; one horse; eko aśvo saptanāma = the Sun or **Āditya**, either as the absorber of the seven flavours, or as praised by the seven ṛṣi; it may be a pun, since sapta = a horse, seven; three-axled wheel: the day with its three **sandhyās**; or time, past, present and fugure; all these regions: all things are dependent upon time, which of itself is imperishable: anādinidhanaḥ **kālaḥ**, time is without beginning or end
