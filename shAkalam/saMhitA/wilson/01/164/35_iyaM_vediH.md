## English translation:

“This altar is the uttermost end of the earth; this sacrifice is the navel of the world; this **Soma** is the fecundating power of the rain-shedding steed; this **Brahmā** is the supreme heavn of (holy) speech.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This altar: etāvatī vai **pṛthivī** yāvātī **vediḥ**, such or so much, verily, as the earth, so much is the altar; it is the essence of the whole earth (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.6.4); the navel of the world: **nābhi** = sannahana, the binding together of man with the mans of subsistence, or the crops that spring from the rain which falls as the consequence of sacrifice or of oblations; holy speech: the texts of the **Vedas**, of which Brahmā, or the priest, is the author ir expounder
