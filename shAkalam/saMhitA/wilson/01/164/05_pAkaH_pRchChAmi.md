## English translation:

“Immature (in understanding) undiscerning in mind, I inquire of those things which are hidden (even) from the gods; (what are) the seven threads which the sages have spread to envelop the sun, in whom all abide?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Immature: **pākaḥ** = lit. ripening, being or making mature; here, it is equated with paktavyaḥ, what is to be matured; apakvamatiraham, I of immature mind; seven threads: sapta tantūn = seven forms of the **soma** sacrifice, or the seven metres of the **vedas**; the seen: vatse baṣkaye **adhi**: vatse = sarvasya nivāsa bhūte;

Baṣkaye = āditye; the lit. meaning is, a yearling calf, just as **vatsa** also means a calf; the term vatse is already used, hence, baṣkaya = time or the sun
