## English translation:

“The seven who preside over this sevenpwheeled chariot (are) the seven horses who draw it; seven sisters ride in it together, and in are deposited the seven forms of utterance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The seven: either the solar rays or the seven portions of a year: **ayana** (solstine season), month, fortnight, day, night, hour; seven horses: seven wheels and seven horses are the seven solar rays; seven sisters: either the rays of the run, or the six seasons and the aggregate year of the six double and one intercalary month; seven forms of utterance: seven notes of music as employed in chanting the praises of the Sun; or, if gavām is used in the sense of water, the seven forms may be the seven divine rivers
