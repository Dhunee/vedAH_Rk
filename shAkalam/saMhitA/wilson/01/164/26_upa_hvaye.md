## English translation:

“I invoke the cow that is easily milked, that the handy milker may milk her; may **Savitā** accept this our excellent libation, that his heat may (thereby) increase; it is for this, verily, that I earnestly invoke him.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The cow is the cloud, the milk is the rain; **Vāyu** or win, is the milker; the metaphor is continued in the following three hymns, where the calf is the world or mankind anxious for the rain, as the cause of abundance
