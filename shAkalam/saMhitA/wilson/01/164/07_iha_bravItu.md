## English translation:

“Let him who knows this (truth) quickly declare it; the mysterious condition of the beautiful ever-moving (sun); the rays shed (their) milk from his (exalted) head investing his form with radiance; they have drunk up the water by the paths (by which they were poured forth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the paths: the solar rays, which sedn down rain and also reabsorb water
