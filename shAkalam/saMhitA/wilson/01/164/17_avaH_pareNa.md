## English translation:

“The cow, holding her calf underneath with her fore-feet, and then above with her hind-feet, has risen up; whither is she gone; to whom has she turned back when half-way; where does she bear young; it is not amidst the herd.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The cow is the burnt-offering and the calf is **Agni** and the positions of the two indicate the station of the offerer with respect to the sun; or, the cow may typify the solar rays collectively and the calf the worshipper
