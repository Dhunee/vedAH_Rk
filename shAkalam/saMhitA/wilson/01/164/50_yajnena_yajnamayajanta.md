## English translation:

“The gods sacrifice with sacrifice, for such are their first duties; those mighty ones assemble in heaven, where the divinities who are to be propitiated (by sacred rites) abide.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Where the divinities: **yatra** pūrve **sādhyāḥ** **santi** **devāḥ**: sādhyāḥ = **karma**-**devaḥ**, divinities presiding over or giving effect to religious acts, yajñādi sādhanavantaḥ; or, the term may mean those who have obtained the portion, or the condition of gods, by the former worship of **Agni**, or the **sādhyās** = **ādityas**, or the **aṅgirasas**, or deities presiding over the metres, chando abhimāninaḥ; sādhyās are named among the minor divinities in **Amarakośa**
