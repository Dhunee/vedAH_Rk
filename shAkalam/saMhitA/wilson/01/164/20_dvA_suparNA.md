## English translation:

“Two birds associated together, and mutual friends, take refuge in the same tree; one of them eats the sweet fig; the other abstaining from food, merely looks on.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Two birds associated together: the vital and **supreme spirit**, jivātmā and **paramātmā**, are here alluded to using the metaphor of the two birds; eats the sweet fig: pippalam **svādu** **atti**: the vital spirit enjoys the rewards of acts. dvau dvau pratiṣṭhitau sukṛtau dharmakartārau: two species of **souls** to be intended as abiding in one body (**Nirukta** 14.30)
