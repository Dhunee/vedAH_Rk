## English translation:

“The three, with beautiful tresses, look down in their several seasons upon the earth; one of them, when the year is ended, shears (the ground); one, by his acts, overlooks the universe; the course of one is visible, though not his form.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three: **Agni**, who burns up the earth; the Sun, who revives it by his light, and the rain which he sends; and **Vāyu**, the wind, who contributes to the fall of rain
