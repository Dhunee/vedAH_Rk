## English translation:

“Where the smooth-gliding (rays), cognizant (of their duty), distil the perpetual portion of ambrosia (water); there has the lord and steadfast protector all beings consigned me, (though) immature (in wisdom).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Smooth-gliding: supraṇa = supatanaḥ **śobhana** **gamana** raśmayaḥ, the goers easily or beautifully, the rays of the sun; consigned me: **Āditya** has admitted, or admits me, the reciter of the hymn, to the sphere of the sun
