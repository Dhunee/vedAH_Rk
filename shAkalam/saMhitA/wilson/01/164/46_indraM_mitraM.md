## English translation:

“They have styled (him, the Sun), **Indra**, **Mitra**, **Varuṇa**, **Agni**, and he is the celestial, well-winged **Garutmat**, for learned priests call one by many names as they speak of Agni, **Yama**, **Mātariśvan**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hi, the Sun: Sun is assumed; **Nirukta** assumes the Agni: agni is all the divinities (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.3)
