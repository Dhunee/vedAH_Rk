## English translation:

“**Dasras**, in truth most imperial, adorable, swifter than the winds, and eminent in good works, riders in a car, and most distinguished charioteers, bring hither your car, full heaped up with ambrosia, and with it come, **Aśvins**, to the donor (of the offering).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Most imperial: indratamā, superlatively **indra**; so, maruttamā, superlatively **maruts**; marutttamā may also mean, of moderated passions, mild, genitive le, mitarāgiṇau; or, not noisy, mitarāviṇau
