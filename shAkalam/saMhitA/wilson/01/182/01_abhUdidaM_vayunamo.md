## English translation:

“The information, sage (priests), has been received; be ready with your praises, for the (benefit) showering car (of the **Aśvins** has arrived); propitiate (the divinities), for they show favour to the doer of good works; they are entitled to praise, rich in benevolence to mankind the grandsons of heaven, and observers of holy rites.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rich in benevolence: viśpalāvasu, having wealth; **vasu**, which is cherishing **palā** for **pāla**; mankind, vis'; the reference may be to the legend of the metal or golden leg given to viśpala) (RV. 1.171.15)
