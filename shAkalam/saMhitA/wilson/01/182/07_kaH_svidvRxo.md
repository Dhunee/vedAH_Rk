## English translation:

“What was the tree that was stationed in the midst of the ocean, to which the supplicating son of **Tugra** clung; as leaves (are caught hold of) for the support of a falling animal; you, **Aśvins**, bore him up to safety, to your great renown.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As leaves for the support: parṇā mṛgasya patatorivārabhe: **mṛga** = mārjaytrī śodhayitrī, a sweeper, a cleaner; thus, like leaves for the support or prop in the occurrence of injury, and the like, of a sweeper when falling, patanaśīlasya mārjayituḥ śodhayitur hiṃsāder ārabhe ālambanāya parṇāniva, as they are sufficient for support, tāni yathālambanāya prabhavanti tad vat
