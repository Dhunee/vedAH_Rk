## English translation:

“Through your friendship, **Pūṣan**, they who are diligent in your praise and assiduous in your worship enjoy (abundance), through your protection; by (assiduous) worship they enjoy (abundance); as consequent upon your recent favour, we solicit infinite riches. Free from anger, and entitled to ample praise, be ever accessible to us; be our leader in every encounter.”
