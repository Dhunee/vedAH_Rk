## English translation:

“I exalt you, **Pūṣan**, with praises, that you may hasten (to the sacrifice), like a rapid (courser) to the battle; that you may bear us across the combat, like a camel; therefore do I, a mortal, invoke you, the divine bestower of happiness, for your friendship; and do you render our invocation productive (of benefit); render them productive (of success) in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uṣṭro na = like a camel; as a camel bears a burden; productive of benefit: dyumninaskṛdhi, make them possessed of wealth = **dyumna** = dyotanavataḥ, brilliant or having fame of food, yaśovataḥ or annavataḥ; in the reiteration, the latter is explained as the result of conquests.
