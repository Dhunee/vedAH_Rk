## English translation:

“Free from anger, and liberal of gifts, be nigh to us, Ajāśva, for the acceptance of this our (offering); be nigh to those, Ajāśva, who solicit food; we have recourse to you, destroyer of enemies, with pious hymns. I never cease, **Pūṣan**, accepter of offerings, to think of you; I never disregard your friendship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ajāśva = he who is drawn by goats, or has goats for horses, according to **Yāska**
