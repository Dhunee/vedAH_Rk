## English translation:

“The greatness of the strength of the many-worshipped **Pūṣan** is universally lauded; no one detracts (from his praise); his praise displeases no one. Desirous of happiness, I adore him, whose protection is ever nigh; who is the source of felicity; who, when devoutly worshipped, blends with the thoughts of all (his worshippers); who, (thought) a deity, is united with the sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Mana** āyuyuve **makha**, **deva** āyuyuve **makhaḥ** : the text intends to identify Pūṣan, spiritually or mystically, with the performer and and the performance of the worship; a different explanation is offered: makha = yajñavān, having or receiving sacrifice, who confers the boon the sacrificer solicits, thus 'mixing with' or assenting to his thoughts or mind (mana ayuyuve samantād miśrayati s'Ighravara pradānāt); makha repeated is equated with makham, objective case, the sacrifice, with which Pūṣan mixes, or is present at, until completed, sampūrtiparyantam miśrayati
