## English translation:

“Whatever good you may, **Agni**, bestow upon the giver (of the oblation), that verily, **Aṅgiras** shall revert to you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aṅgiras = **aṅgāra**, a live coal (**Nirukta** 3.17); 'the coals became the **Aṅgirasas**', ye **aṅgārāḥ** āsanste aṅgiraso abhavan (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 3.34); the legend: (**Mahābhārata**, Vanaparvan, Vol. II) **Mārkaṇḍeya** tells **Yudhiṣṭhira**, when the latter asks, "How is it that while Agni, went too the forest and ceased his functions; yet, Aṅgiras became Agni to convey the oblations to gods? How is it that Agni, who is one, becomes many?" Agni, says Mārkaṇḍeya, engaged in penance and relinquished his duties; **Muni** Aṅgiras took upon himself the office of Agni. When he prevailed upon Agni to resume his office, the latter became his son; his descendants, the Aṅgirasas, therefore are also the descendants of Agni, or so many **Agnis**, or fires. The fires are enumerated at length, explained as person nification of light, of luminous bodies, of divisions of time, of celestial phenomena, and fires adapted to peculiar occasions (full-moon, changes in phases of moon or to particular rites, **aśvamedha**, **rājasūya**, **pāka yajñas** (sacrifices with food), obsequial and funeral fires, expiatory fires). A further legend is told: First Agni is called **Saha**, who hid himself in the ocean to avoid the approach of **Niyata**, the son of **Bharata**, the fire of the funeral pile. The text says, 'through fear'; **Sāyaṇa** adds: either through fear of being rendered impure by his contact, or being ashamed of his relationship, Niyata being his own grandson. When gods came looking for Agni, the latter designated as his substitute, **Atharvan**, also called Aṅgiras
