## English translation:

“**Agni**, the unobstructed sacrifice of which you are on every side the protector, assuredly reaches the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Adhvaram yajñm, free from injury or interruption; 'on every side': fires at a sacrifice are lighted at four cardinal points: **āhavanīya**, mājālīya, **gārhapatya** and agnīdhrīya
