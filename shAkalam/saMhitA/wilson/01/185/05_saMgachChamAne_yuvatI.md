## English translation:

“Going always together, equally young, and of the like termination, sisters, and kindred, and scenting the navel of the world, plural ced on their lap as its parents; defend us, Heaven and Earth, from great danger.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Scenting the navel: abhijighrantī bhuvanasya nābhim pitror upasthe: **nābhi** = water, udakam, as the binding of all beings, bhūtajātasya bandhakam; this may be regarded as the child of heaven and earth, as they both contribute to its production: ubhayor **udaka** pradatvam prasiddham; or, the two here mentioned may imply water and the oblation, which are also connected
