## English translation:

“Which of these two, (Heaven and Earth), is prior which posterior; how were they engendered; (declare), sages, who knows this? verily, you uphold the universe of itself, and the days (and nights) revolve as if they had wheels.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Days and nights revolve: **ahan** cakriyeva, two days as if wheeled; i.e. the succession of day and night, each of which may be considered in turn as preceding or folliowing the other, like the rotations of a wheel
