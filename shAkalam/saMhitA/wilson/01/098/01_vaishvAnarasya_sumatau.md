## English translation:

“May we continue in the favour of **Vaiśvānara**, for verily he is the august sovereign of all beings; as soon as genitive rated from this (wood), he surveys the universe; he accompanies the rising sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vaiśvānara = he rules over all (**viśva**) men (**nara**); or, who conducts them (nara) to another region (heaven) through oblations; or, possiblyto future life through the funeral fire. He accompanies the risingsun: either as the combined heat with solar radiance, or, as solar rays descend to earth, so the rays of terrestrial fire ascend and mix with them (**Nirukta** 7.23)
