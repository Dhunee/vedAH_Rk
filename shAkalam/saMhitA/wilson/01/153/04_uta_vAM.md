## English translation:

“May the divine cows, and the waters, supply you with (sacrificial) food, for the prosperity of the people whom you favour; or may (**Agni**), the former protector of this (our patron), be the donor (of the oblation); eat (of the butter and curds), drink of the milk of the kine.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Milk of the kine: vītam pātam **payasa** usriyāyāḥ, eat, drink, of the milk of the cow; 'eating' may refer to the coagulation of the milk, or curds, butter, or the like
