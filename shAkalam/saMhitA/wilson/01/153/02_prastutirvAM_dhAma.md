## English translation:

“The purpose of worshipping you, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, is not the performance, but (even by so much) I may attain to your glory, and there is acquittance (of my duty); for when the priest offers you oblations in sacrifices, then the pious man, showerers (of benefits), being desirous of worshipping you, (obtains) felicity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

There is acquittance: prastutiḥ vām **dhāma** na prayuktir ayāmi suvṛktiḥ = lit. the previous purpose of praising you is not the fulfilment, but I come to your abode well detached; suvṛktiḥ-**śobhana** āvarjako yuṣmāt pārigrahāt
