## English translation:

“Let the productive cow, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, furnish abundant nutriment to the pious man who presents you with oblations, as when Rātahavya, glorifying you, propitiates you in the solemnity, like the ministrant priest of a man (who instrumental tutes the rite).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rātahavya = name of a **rājā**, king
