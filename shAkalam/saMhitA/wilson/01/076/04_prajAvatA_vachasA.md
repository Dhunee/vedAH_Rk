## English translation:

“I invoke (you), who are the conveyor (of oblations), with your flames, with a hymn productive of progeny (to the worshipper); sit down here with the gods, and do you, who are deserving of worship, discharge the office of **Hotā**, or of **Potā** and awaken us, you who are the depository and genitive rator of riches.”
