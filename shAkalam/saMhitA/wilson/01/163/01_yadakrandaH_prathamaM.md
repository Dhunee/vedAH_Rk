“Your great birth, O Horse, is to be glorified; whether first springing from the firmament or from the water inasmuchas you have neighed (auspiciously), for you have the wings of the falcon and the limbs of the deer.”

Spring from the firmament: samudrād uta vā purīṣāt = **antarikṣa**, the firmament, and **udaka**, water;

**Samudra** = the sun
