## English translation:

“Your body, horse, is made for motion; your mind is rapid (in intention) as the wind; the hairs (of your mane) are tossed in manifold directions; and spread beautiful in the forests.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The horse is identified with **Agni**, whose flames consume the forests
