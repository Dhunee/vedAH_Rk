## English translation:

“May the two plural asing-tongued receivers of praise, the divine and sage invokers (of the gods), officiate today at this our sacrifice, which confers (rewards) and attains heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Attains heaven: **mandra**-**jihvā** is an apithet applied to **Agni**, the two flames that give delight to the gods
