## English translation:

“The pure, purifying, wonderful Narāśaṃsa, an adorable god among gods, (having come) from heaven, thrice mixes the sacrifice with the sweet (**Soma**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Narāśaṃsa is the deity presiding over the sacrifice: yajñābhimāni **devaḥ**; thrice mixes: he comes thrice, or he thrice bestows rewards, perhaps an allusion to the three daily sacrifices
