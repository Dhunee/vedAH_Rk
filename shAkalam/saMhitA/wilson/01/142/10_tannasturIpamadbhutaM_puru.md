## English translation:

“May **Tvaṣṭā**, favourably disposed towards us, send to us, for our nourishment and prosperity, the quick (falling), wonderful, abundant (water), in the centre (of the cloud, effecting), of itself much (good).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Qucik (falling), wonderful: the hymn has epithets only related to udakam, water: turīpam adbhutam **puru** **vāram** puru tmanā; in the centre: **nābhā** nābhau meghasya avasthitam udakam, i.e. rain;

Tvaṣṭā = person nified fire or lightning, in which capacity he is the sender of rain, vṛṣṭyādeḥ **kartā**
