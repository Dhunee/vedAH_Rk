In the form of Gāyatra: Gāyatra-vepase--gāyatra is substituted for itara-**sāma**: vepas = **rūpa**; gāyatram- rūpam yasya;

Gāyatravepas = a name or form of Indra; along with Pūṣan and the Maruts: liṭ, having or possessed of Pūṣan or the Maruts: puṣanvate marutvate; viśvadevāya (singular) = **viśvadeva**- saṅghāya, the assemblage of all the gods; or, an epithet to identify Indra with all the deities; the person nification of **Agni** is svāhā, as one of the Āpris
