## English translation:

“I invoke **Mitra**, of pure vigour, and **Varuṇa**, the devourer of foes; the joint accomplishers of the act bestowing water (on the earth).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mitra = the Sun;

Varuṇa = the regent of the waters; both are among the twelve **Ādityas**; Mitra presides over day, Varuṇa presides over night; dhiyam ghṛtācīm sādhantā: dhi, an act; ghṛtācīm, water-shedding
