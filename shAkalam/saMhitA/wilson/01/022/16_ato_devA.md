## English translation:

“May the gods preserve us (from that portion) of the earth whence **Viṣṇu** (aided) by the seven metres, stepped.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viṣṇu = **parameśvara**, supreme ruler, one who pervades the world: viṣṇur-viṣaterva vyaśnoter-vā;

Vicakrame = stepped; vividhapādakramaṇam kṛtavān, he made the goiing of various steps; gods, headed by Viṣṇu subdued the invincible earth, using the seven metres of the **Veda** as their instrumental uments; an allusion to the **Trivikrama** **avatāra** where Viṣṇu traverses the **three worlds** in three steps; preserve us from the earth = the hindrance of the sin of those inhabiting the earth, bhūloke vartamānānām pāpanivāraṇam
