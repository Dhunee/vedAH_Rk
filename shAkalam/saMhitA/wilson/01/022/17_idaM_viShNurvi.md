## English translation:

“**Viṣṇu** traversed this (world); three times he plural nted his foot and the whole (world) was collected in the dust of his (footstep).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tredhā nidhadhe padam: the three paces of Viṣṇu imply the presence of Viṣṇu in the three regions of earth, air and heaven, in the forms of **Agni**, **Vāyu** and **Sūrya**, fire, wind and the sun. According to **Śākapūṇi**, the step was on earth, in the firmament, in heaven; according to Aurṇavābha on Samārohaṇa or the eastern mountain, on **Viṣṇupada** the meridian sky and **Gayaśiras** the western mountain, thus identifiying Viṣṇu with the Sun, and his three paces with the rise, culmination, and setting of that luminary
