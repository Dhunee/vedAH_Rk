## English translation:

“Invoke **Savitā** (Sun), the golden- handed, to protect me; he will appoint the station of the worshippers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Suvarṇahasta = golden-handed, i.e. he who gives gold to the worshipper. Legend: At a sacrifice performed by the gods, **Sūrya** undertook the office of **ṛtvij**, but positioned himself in the station of **Brahmā**. The **Adhvaryu** priests saw him in that position and gave him the oblation termed prāśitra. As soon as this was received, Sūrya cut off the **hand** that had improperly accepted it. The priests who had given the oblation bestowed upon Sūrya a hand of gold
