## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, stir up (mimikṣatam = mix intimately, rapidly like a whip) the sacrifice with your whip that is wet the foam (of your horses), and lashing loudly.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Kāśa** = whip, may also mean speech; **madhumatī** and sunṛtāvatī = wet and loud, signifying sweet and veracious--come with such speech, Aśvins and taste the libation
