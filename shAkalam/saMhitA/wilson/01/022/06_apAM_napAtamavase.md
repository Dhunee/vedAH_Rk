## English translation:

“Glorify **Savitā**, who is no friend to water, or our protection; we desire to celebrate his worship.(apām **napāt** = son of the waters).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Apām-**napat** may also mean the Sun, who is the parent of the waters: ādityāt jāyate **vṛṣṭiḥ**: rain is born from the sun (**Manu** 3.76);

Napāt = lit. who does not cherish (na pālayati), but dried them up by his heat, santāpena śoṣakaḥ
