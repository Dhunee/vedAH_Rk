## English translation:

“**Agni**, like patrimonial wealth, is the giver of food; he is a director, like the instrumental uctions of one learned in scripture; he rests in the sacrificial chamber like a welcome guest, and like an officiating priest, he brings prosperity on the house of the worshipper.”
