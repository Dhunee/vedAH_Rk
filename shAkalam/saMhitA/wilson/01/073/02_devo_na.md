## English translation:

“He who is like the divine Sun, who know the truth (of things), preserves by his actions (his votaries) in all encounters; like nature, he is unchangeable and, like **soul**, is the source of happiness; he is ever to be cherished.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Amati = **rūpa**, **svarūpa**, peculiar form of nature; Like soul which is the seat and source of all happiness, so **Agni**, the chief agent of sacrifice is the main cause of felicity both here and hereafter: Brihadāraṇyaka **Upaniṣad** 4.3.32
