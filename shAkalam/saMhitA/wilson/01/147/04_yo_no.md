## English translation:

“When a wicked (man), with twofold (malignity of thought and speech), obstructing our offerings, and refraining from gifts (himself), reviles us, may his prayer be heavy on him, and involve his person n (in the consequences of) his evil words.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The epithets such as aghāya seem to refer to asmai (not to **mantra**); the allusion is to the use of maledictory prayers or imprecations
