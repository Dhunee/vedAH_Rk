## English translation:

“Your fostering (rays), **Agni**, beholding the blind son of **Mamatā**, relieved him of the affliction; he who knows all things protect the pious, and (their) malevolent enemies are unable to do them harm.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The blind son of Mamatā: the legend: Mamatā was the the wife of Utatthya; her son was **Dīrghatamas**, long-darkness, being the blindness or ignorance which is the natural offspring of Mamatā, mine-ness, or selfishness
