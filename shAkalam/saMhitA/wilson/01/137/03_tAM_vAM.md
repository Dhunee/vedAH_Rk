## English translation:

“They milk for you two with stones, that succulent creeper, like a productive cow; they milk the **Soma** with stones; come to us as our protectors; be present with us to drink the Soma; thos Soma has been effused, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, for you both; effused for your drinking.”
