## English translation:

“Come, for the dipping **Soma** are mixed with curds; they are expressed and mixed with curds; whether they be prepared for you at the awaking of the dawn, or (be associated) with the rays of the sun; the juice is effused for **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, for their drinking the grateful (libation); for their drinking at the sacrifice.”
