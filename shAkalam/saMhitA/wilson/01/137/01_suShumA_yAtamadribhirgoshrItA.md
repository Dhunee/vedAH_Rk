## English translation:

“Come, (**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, to our sacrifice); where we express (the **Soma**) with stones; these Soma mixed with milk are exhilarating; these (Soma) are exhilarating; come to us, royal divinities, dwellers in heaven and our protectors; these Soma are mixed with milk for you, Mitra and Varuṇa, they are pure, mixed with milk.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Matsarāḥ = the repetition of the word suggests the sense of 'envious', envious or emulous of those presented at other ceremonies.
