## English translation:

“The **Ṛbhus** have divided unto four the new ladle, the work of the divine **Tvaṣṭā** (i.e. devasambandhiḥ takṣana.**vyāpāraḥ** = divinity whose duty in relations to gods is carpentry; cf. tvaṣṭā tvaṣṭuḥ **śiṣyāḥ** **Ṛbhavaḥ** = Ṛbhus are the disciples of Tvaṣṭā; four ladles are an apparent reference to an innovation in the objects of libation for sharing).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tvaṣṭā is the artisan of the gods; he is a divinity whose duty is carpentry, with relation to the gods
