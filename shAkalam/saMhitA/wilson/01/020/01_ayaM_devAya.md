## English translation:

“This hymn, the bestower of riches, has been addressed by the sages, with their own mouths, to the (class of) divinities having birth (lit. to the divine or brilliant birth; e.g. **Ṛbhus**--**Ṛbhu**, **Vibhu** and **Vāja** were pious men, who through penance became divinities).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Devāya janmane: lit. to the divine or brilliant birth;

Janmane: jāyamānāya, being born, or having birth;

Devāya: **deva**-saṅghāya, a class of divinities, Ṛbhus who achieved deification: **manuṣyāḥ** santastapasā devatvam prāptāḥ. Ṛbhus were three sons of **Sudhanvan**, a descendant of **Aṅgiras**. Through their good work (**svapas** = su-**apas**), they became divine, exercised superhuman powers and became entitled to receive praise and adoration. They dwell in the solar sphere, identified with the rays of the sun
