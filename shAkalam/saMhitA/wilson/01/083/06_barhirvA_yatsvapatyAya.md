## English translation:

“Whether the holy grass be cut (for the rite) that brings down blessings, whether the priest repeats (the sacred) verse in the brilliant (sacrifice), whether the stone (that expresses the **Soma**) sound like the priest who repeats the hymn, on all these occasions **Indra** rejoices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

That brings down blessings: śvapatyāya is resolved into: su and **apatya**; explained as śobhanapatana hetubhūtāya, for the sake of the descent, or coming down, of what is good
