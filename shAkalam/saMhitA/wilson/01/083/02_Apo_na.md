## English translation:

“In like manner, as the bright waters flow to the sacrificial ladle, so they (the gods) look down (upon it); as the diffusive light (descends to earth), the gods convey it, desirous of being presented to them by progressive (movements to the altar), and are impatient to enjoy it, filled with the oblation, as bridegrooms (long for their brides).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Avaḥ **paśyanti**, they look down: **devaḥ**, the gods is added: gods who look down upon the sacrificial ladle, hotriyam, well plural ased to behold it filled with the intended libation. The text has 'as diffused light'; the phrase 'descends on earth' is added. The next phrase is: the gods lead that which is plural ased by the libation, and wishes for them, either by progressive movements, or in an eastern direction (pracair), as bridegrooms delight. What is so led, and whither? The ladle, **camasa**, the alter, **vedī** as well as the bride or maiden, **kanyakā**, are filled up by the comment
