## English translation:

“**Atharvan** first by sacrifices discovered the path (of the stolen cattle); then the bright sun, the cherisher of pious acts, was born. Atharvan regained the cattle; **Kāvya** (Uṣanās) was associated with him. Let us worship the immortal (**Indra**), who was born to restrain (the **asuras**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ajani, was born: 'the sun appeared, in order to light the way to the cave where the cows were hidden'; Kāvya is identified with Uṣanās; Uṣanās is identified with **Bhṛgu**; **kāvyaḥ** kaveḥ **putra** uṣanā **bhṛguḥ**, meaning that only Uṣanās was of the family of Bhṛgu (cf. **Viṣṇu Purāṇa**, 82); To restrain (the asuras): the text has yamasya jātam; the term yamasya is explained: asurāṇām niyamanārtham
