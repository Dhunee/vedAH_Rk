## English translation:

“Celebrate, **Kaṇvas**, the aggregate strength of the **Maruts**, sportive, with horses, but shining in their car.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kaṇvas = sages or priests;

Anarvāṇam = bhrātṛvya-rahitam, lit. without a brother's son;

**Arvan** = a horse; since Maruts' chariot is drawn by deer, they can do without horses;

Bhrātṛvya = enemy
