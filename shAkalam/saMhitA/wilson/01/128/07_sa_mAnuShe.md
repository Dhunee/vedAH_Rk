## English translation:

“**Agni** is a most amiable friend in human infirmity through the means of sacrifices; the beloved protector of all in sacrifices, like a victorious prince, he alights upon the oblations of men when plural ced upon the altar; he preserves us from the malignity of **Varuṇa**; from the malignity of the mighty deity (of sin).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trāsate varuṇasya dhūrter maho **devasya** dhūrteḥ, preserves us from the malevolence of the obstructor of religious rites (varuṇa = **vāraka**, the impeder)-- from the malevolence of the mighty deity presiding over sin, **pāpa**-**devatā**
