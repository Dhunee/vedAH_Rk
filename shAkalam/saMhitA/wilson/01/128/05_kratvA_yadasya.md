## English translation:

“Inasmuch as (all men) offer in holy rite (food) for his satisfaction in the blazing (flames) of **Agni**, like (the grains that) are to be enjoyed by the winds, and like the viands that are to be given to him who solicits them; therefore the worshipper presents gifts to him, according to the extent of his opulence; and he preserves us, when oppressed (by sin), from wickedness; from overpowering malevolence and sin.”
