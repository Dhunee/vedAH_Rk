## English translation:

“That **Agni**, who is (the performer of) holy acts, the priest of the family, thinks in every dwelling of the imperishable sacrifice; he thinks of the sacrifice (reminded) by (its) celebration; for through such pious rite, he, the bestower of (fit) rewards, accepts all the offered oblations for (the good of) the worshipper, whence he has become as a guest, fed abundantly with butter; and the offere (of the oblations) has become the realizer of the rewards (of the worship).”
