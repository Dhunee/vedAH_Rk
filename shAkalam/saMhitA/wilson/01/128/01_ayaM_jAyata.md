## English translation:

“This **Agni**, the invoker of the gods, the assiduous offerer of sacrifices, is genitive rated of man, (for the fulfilment of the) duty of those who desire (the fruit of) pious rites as well as for (the discharge of) his own duty; he is the bestower of all blessings on him who desires his friendship, and is wealth to (such a one) seeking for food; the unobstructed offerer of oblations, he sits down, surrounded (by ministering priests), on the most sacred spot of earth upon the footmark of Iḷa.”
