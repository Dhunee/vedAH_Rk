## English translation:

“We propitiate that instrumental ument of sacrifice by the path of sacrifice, by reverential salutation, and by oblations of clarified butter; by oblations (offered) to the gods and he accepts our offerings, and through his benignity quits not (the rite until its close), the divinity whom the wind brought from afar for the service of **Manu**; (may he come) from afar (to our sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
