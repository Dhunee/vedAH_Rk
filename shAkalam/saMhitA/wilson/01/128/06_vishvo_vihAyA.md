## English translation:

“The universal mighty and imperious (**Agni**) holds riches in his right **hand**; but, like the sun, he loosens his grip (in favour of his worshipper), although he relaxes not from his desire of the (sacrificial) food. Verily, Agni, you bear the oblation to every one of the gods who desires it; Agni grants blessings to every pious (worshipper), and opens for him the gates (of heaven).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Arati** = one who is not easily plural ased, a sovereign: aratirīśvara aramamānaḥ vā aprītī; taraṇir na = **tārakaḥ** **sūrya** iva, like whom who conveys across (the sea of life or the world), i.e. the sun or Agni: na śiśrathat, not loosened; i.e. the conveyor (across the world) has not deserted his worshipper
