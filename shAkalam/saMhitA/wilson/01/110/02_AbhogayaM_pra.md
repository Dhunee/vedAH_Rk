## English translation:

“When, **Ṛbhus**, you who are amongst my ancestors, yet immature (in wisdom), but desirous of enjoying (the **Soma** libations), retired to the forest to perform (penance), then, sons of **Sudhanvan**, throught he plural nitude of your completed (devotions), you came to the (sacrificial) hall of the worshipper **Savitā**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhurvibhvā **vāja** iti sudhanvana āṅgirasasya **trayaḥ** putrāḥ babhūvuḥ (**Nirukta** 11.16): Sudhanvan, father of the Ṛbhus, was a descendant of **Aṅgiras**; so is **Kutsa**;

Prāñcaḥ = **pūrva** kālīna, of a former period; Kutsa is a kinsman of Ṛbhus of a former period
