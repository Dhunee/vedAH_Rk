## English translation:

“Then **Savitā** bestowed upon you immortality, when you came to him, who is not to be concealed, and representd (your desire) to partake of the libations; and that ladle for the sacrificial viands which the **Asura** had formed single, you made fourfold.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who is not to be concealed: In the previous hymn, Savitā (from su, to offer oblations) perhaps refers to the presenter of oblations; in this hymn, the sun is alluded to
