## English translation:

“(The priests) desirous of wealth, holding stones in their **hands**, praise the divine (**Agni**) Draviṇodas (= Agni, donor of wealth), both in the primary (e.g. **Agniṣṭoma**) and subsidiary (e.g. **Ukthya**) sacrifices.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Grāva**-hastāsaḥ, having stones in their hands, with which to bruise **Soma**. Grāva-vān is one of the 16 priests. Draviṇodas is an appellative of Agni; donor (das) of wealth, or of strength, **draviṇa**; **adhvara** is said to be the primary or essential ceremony, **prakṛti**-**rūpa**, e.g. agniṣṭoma; **yajña** related to mofied ceremonies, **vikṛti**-rupeṣu, e.g. ukthya, elsewhere refered to as offering with Soma: somasaṃsthayāgam
