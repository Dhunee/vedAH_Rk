## English translation:

“That eminent person n, the cherisher of the pious, (he instrumental tutor of the ceremony), promotes his own prosperity, who, while offering oblations to **Indra**, pronounces his praise; or who, along with the offerings he presents, recites hymns (in honour of him); for him the bounteous Indra causes the clouds to rain from heaven.”
