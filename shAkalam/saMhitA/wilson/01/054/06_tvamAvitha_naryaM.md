## English translation:

“You have protected **Narya**, **Turvaśa**, **Yadu** and **Turvīti**, of the face of **Vayya**; you have protected their chariots and horses in the unavoidable engagement; you have demolished ninety-nine cities (of **Śambara**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Turvaśa may be **Turvasu**, son of **Yayāti**, since another son of Yayāti, Yadu is also named. Turvīti is a ṛṣi;

Etasam = **aśva**
