## English translation:

“Offer exhilarating praises to the great and illustrious **Indra**, of whom, undaunted, the steady mind is concentrated in its own firmness; for he, who is of great renown, the giver of rain, the repeller of enemies, who is obeyed his steeds, the showerer (of bounties), is hastening hither.”
