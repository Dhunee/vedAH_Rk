## English translation:

“Where, **Maruts**, is the limit of the vast region (whence you come); where is the beginning of that to which you proceed; when you scatter the dense vapour like light grass, and hurl down the brilliant rain-cloud by the thunderbolt.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The limit of the vast region: rajaso mahasparam = the limit of the rains;

**Rajas** = **loka**, or, **udaka**
