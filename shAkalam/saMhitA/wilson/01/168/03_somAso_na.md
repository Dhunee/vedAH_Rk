## English translation:

“They, who are like the **Soma**, with well-nourished shoots, and then poured out (in libations), are imbibed; they abide, like devoted adherents, in the hearts (of men); upon their shoulders hangs (a lance) like a youthful feminine le, and in their **hands** a guard and sword are wielded.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With well-nourished shoots: tṛptāṃśavaḥ = tṛptāvayavaḥ, having satisfied or well-nourished limbs; hangs (lance): what is suspended on the shoulders of the **Maruts** is not specified; the suggestion is, either a lance, **śakti** or the beuty of the arms, bhujalakṣmī
