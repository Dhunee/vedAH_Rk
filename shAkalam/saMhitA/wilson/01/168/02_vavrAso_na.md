## English translation:

“They who are as if embodied, self-born, self-invigorated, and (ever) tremulous (in movement), are genitive rated (to confer) abundant food and heaven; they are numerous as the undulations of the waters; they are to be praised when present, shedding water, like cows (yielding milk).”
