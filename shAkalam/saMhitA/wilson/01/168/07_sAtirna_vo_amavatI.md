## English translation:

“Like your possession of treasure, **Maruts**, is your liberality; ministerial (of **Indra**'s bounty), heaven-bestowing, brilliant, fruitful, favourable to the husbandman, propitious; it is like the donation of a wealthy (donor), prompt (of distribution), and like the all-subduing force of the **asuras**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the all-subduing force: asuryeva jañjatī = asurasya sarvābhibhavantī **śakti**: as the asuras take from one to give to another, so the winds plural nder the clouds to enrich the earth
