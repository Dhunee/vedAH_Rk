## English translation:

“**Maruts**, at every sacrifice your alacrity is uniform; you, verily, discharge your every function for the benefit of the gods; therefore, do I invite you to come hither, by sacred hymns, for (the sake of) your powerful protection of heaven and earth, and your benevolent praise.”
