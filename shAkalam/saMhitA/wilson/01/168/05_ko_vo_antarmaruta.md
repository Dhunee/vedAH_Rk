## English translation:

“**Maruts**, lightning-armed, who, (standing) amongst you, sets you of yourselves in motion, as the jaws are (set in motion) by the tongue; as falling rains(are essential) for the obtaining of food, so (those, desirous of sustenance), excite you in various ways, like a horse in (his) daily (training).”
