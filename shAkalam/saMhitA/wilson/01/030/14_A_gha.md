“O Dhṛṣnu, let some such divinity as you are, self-presented, promptly bestow, when solicited, (bounties) upon your praisers, as (they whirl) the axle of the wheels (of a car).”

**Dhṛṣṇu** = resolute, firm, high-spirited (**Indra**); akṣam na cakrayoḥ = of the two wheels of a car; prakṣipanti (= turn over) is assumed
