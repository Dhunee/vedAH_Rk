## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, excellent and steady, may your chariot, vast as the earth, broad-fronted, rapid as the rain (fleet) as thought, cumulative and adorable, come hither for (our) good.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Emulative: ahampūrvaḥ, I first, is normally related to a warrior, one who would be first in battle; here, it is explained as intelligent, manasvin; or very genitive rous atyudāraḥ
