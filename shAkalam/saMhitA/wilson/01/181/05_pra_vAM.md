## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, may the golden-coloured (car of one of you), traversing at will the quarters of space, come to our dwellings; may mankind encourage the horses of the other by food, by friction, and by shouts.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Traversing at will: niceruḥ kakuho vaśām anu: **kakuha** is an epithet of **ratha**, signifying best, **śreṣṭha**; it may also mean the points of the horizon
