## English translation:

“The wise offerer of oblations, like **Pūṣan**, praises you, **Aśvins**, as (he would praise) **Agni** and Uṣā, (at the season) at which I invoke you praising with devotion that we may thence obtain food, strength, and long life.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the season: the allusion is to the time at which it is especially proper to worship Aśvins, the morning sacrifice
