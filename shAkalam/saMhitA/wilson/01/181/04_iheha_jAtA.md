## English translation:

“Born here (in the middle region) and here (in the upper region), you are glorified together, as faultless in your forms and (perfect in) your own many excellences; one (of you) the victorious son (of the firmament), the devout (promoter) of sacred sacrifice, the other, the auspicious son of heaven, (each) upholds (the world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Born here and here: iheha **jātā** = liṭ, born here and here, iha iha; the amplification identifies the **Aśvins** with the sun and the moon; faultless in your forms: arepasā tanvā nāmabhiḥ svaiḥ: arepasā = free from sin, apāpau; the allusion is to the legend of the decapitation of Dadhyañc, by which act, with reference to its result, no sin was incurred; the auspicious son of heaven: as the same with the moon and sun, one **Aśvin** may be termed the son of the middle region or firmament; the other, the son of the upper region, heaven or sky
