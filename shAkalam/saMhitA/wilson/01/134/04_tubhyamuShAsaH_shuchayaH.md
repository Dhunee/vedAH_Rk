## English translation:

“For you, the brilliant dawns, (rising) from afar, spread abroad their auspicious raiment in inviting rays; in variegated and glorious rays; for these, the cow that yields ambrosia milks all kinds of treasure; you beget the **Maruts**, of the firmament, for (the purpose) of showering rain; (for the purpose of replenishing) the rivers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Inviting rays: daṃsu, raśmiṣu: daṃsu = daṃseṣu karmavatsu, doing their work; or, **daṃsa** = a house, i.e. in rays investing or covering the world like a house; or, it may refer to the chamber of sacrifice, in which the fires are lighted at dawn, and the rays or flames of the fire may be said to offer a raiment to **Vāyu**; **bhadra** **vastra**, auspicious garments;

Sabardughā: sabar = **amṛta**
