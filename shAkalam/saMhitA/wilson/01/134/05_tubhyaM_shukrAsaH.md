## English translation:

“For you, the bright, pure, quick-flowing (**Soma**), potent for exhilaration, are eager for the (fire of) oblation; are eager for the cloud (showering) waters. The timid and anxious (worshipper) praises you, who are auspicious, for (driving away) thieves; for you defend (us) from all beings, (as the reward) of our righteousness; you protect us from the fear of evil spirits, (as the reward) of our righteousness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The oblations that are offered to fire are the remote cause of the rain;

Bhurvan = **yāga**, a sacrifice; and, a cloud; You who are auspicious: tvām bhagamo takvavīye: bhajanīyam, that which is to be enjoyed, that which is agreeable or acceptable; taskarāṇām **yajña**- vighatinām **anyatra** gamanāya, for causing to go elsewhere thieves,i.e., obstructers of sacrifices
