## English translation:

“You, **Vāyu**, who are preceded by none, are entitled to drink first of these our **Soma** libations; you are entitled to drink of the effused, moreover, (of all) oblations and sin-offerings of men; for you, their cattle yield milk; (for you) they yield butter.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Āśiram = kṣīram; **ghṛta**; in both meanings, aṣrayana dravyam, an article which is the material of oblations and the like
