## English translation:

“Let your swift coursers, **Vāyu**, bring you quickly hither, that you may be the first to drink; the first (of the gods) to drink of the **Soma**. May our appraised, discriminating, and sincere (praise) be acceptable to your mind; come with your steed-yoked car for (the libation) to be presented to you; come, Vāyu, for granting (the objects of worship).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Steed-yoked car: niyutvatā rathenā: with the car having the **niyuts**; denominating the horse of Vāyu; For granting the objects: dāvane: from dav, to give; i.e. 'come for that which is to be given by us', dāyavyayu; and, 'for giving to us that we solicit'
