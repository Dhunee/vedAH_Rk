## English translation:

“May the exhilarating drops (of the libation) exhilarate you, **Vāyu**, being fitly prepared, doing their office, administered opportunely, rendered efficacious by (our) praises, and flowing (in due season); for which purpose, your docile and active steeds, the **niyuts**, attending (your presence, bring you) to the sacrificial hall to accept the offering; to the sacrifice in which the pious (priests) represent their desires.”
