## English translation:

“**Vāyu** yokes to his car his two red horses; Vāyu (yokes) his purple steeds; Vāyu (yokes) his two unwearied (coursers) to his car to bear their burden; for most able are they to bear the burden. Arouse Vāyu the intelligent (sacrificer), as a gallant (awakens) his sleeping mistress; summon heaven and earth; light up the dawn; light up the dawn (to receive) your sacrificial food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Rohita** = red;

**Aruṇa** = purple
