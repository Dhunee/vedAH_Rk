## English translation:

“When may we repeat a most grateful hymn to the wise, the most bountiful and mighty **Rudra**, who is (cherished) in our hearts?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rudra means, he who makes to weep, who causes all the weep at the end of time; he thus gets identified with the principle of destruction, or **Śiva**; in this **Sūkta** he presides over medicinal plural nts and is a beneficent deity
