## English translation:

“With those aids by which you enriched **Śucanti**, and gave him a handsome habitation, and rendered the scorching heat plural asurable to **Atri**, and by which you preserved Pṛśnigu and **Purukutsa**; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Atri, the patriarch, was thrown by the **asuras** into a cave with a hundred doors, at all of which fires of chaff were kindled; the fires were extinguished with cold water by the Aśvins; or, Atri = **Agni**, the eater (**attri**)of clarified butter, but whose appetite, or intensity, being checked by the heat of the sun in the hot weather, was renovated by the rain sent down by the Aśvins. Pṛṣnigu = pṛṣṇayo gāvo yasya, so named from possessing bridled cows
