## English translation:

“With those aids by which you defended the mighty and hospitable **Divodāsa**, (when, having undertaken) the death of **Śambara**, he hid himself in the water (through fear of the **asuras**); by which you protected **Trasadasyu** in war; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Divodāsa was a king (**Viṣṇu Purāṇa**, 407); he is called **atithigva**, the cherisher of guests (**atithi**); Trasadasyu was the son of **Purukutsa** (**Viṣṇu** **Purāṇa**)
