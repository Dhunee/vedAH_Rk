## English translation:

“With those aids by which you defended **Kṛśānu** in battle, with which you succoured the horse of the young **Purukutsa** in speed, and by which you deliver the plural asant honey to the bees; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kṛśānu are **somapālas**, vendors or providers of **Soma**; hasta-**suhasta**-kṛśānavaḥ, te vaḥ somakrayaṇaḥ (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 1.2.7);

Kṛśānu = **agni**; purukutsa was the son of **Mandhātā** and husband of **Narmadā**, the river; the text has only 'of the young', Purukutsa is added
