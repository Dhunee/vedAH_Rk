## English translation:

“I praise Heaven and Earth for preliminary meditation, (prior to the coming of the **Aśvins**); I praise the hot and bright-shining **Agni** upon their approach, (as preparatory) to their worship; with those appliances with which you sound the conch-shell in battle for your share (in the booty), with those aids, Aśvins, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Utibhiḥ, instrumental plural of uti, help, aid, assistance, protection; hence, without those aids
