## English translation:

“Earnest and exclusive adorers stand, **Aśvins**, round your car, (to benefit) by your bounty, as (disciples listen) to the words (of a teacher) for instrumental uction; with those aids with which you defend the pious who are engaged in acts of worship, come, Aśvins,wilingly hither.”
