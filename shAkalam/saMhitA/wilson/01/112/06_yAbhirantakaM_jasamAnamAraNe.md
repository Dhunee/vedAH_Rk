## English translation:

“With those aids by which you rescued **Antaka**, (when cast into) a deep (pool), and about to be destroyed; by which, inflicting no distress, you preserved **Bhujyu**, and by which you relieved **Karkandhu** and **Vayya**; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Antaka was a **rājarṣi**, whom the **asuras** threw into a pond or a well;

Bhujyu = son of **Rājā** **Tugra**. Bhujyu had embarked on a maritime expedition against the enemies of his father, but encountered a storm, in which his vessel was lost; he was saved, and brught back to his father by the intervention of the Aśvins; Karkabandhu and Vayya: asuras whom the Aśvins extricated from isfortunes; cf. RV. I.116.3
