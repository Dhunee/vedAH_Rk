## English translation:

“With those aids by which the circumambient (wind), endowed with the vigour of his son, the measurer of the two worlds (of heaven and earth), and swiftest of the swift, beautifies (all things), and by which (**Kakṣīvat**) became learned in the three kinds of sacrifice; with them come, **Aśvins**, willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Endowed with the vigour of his son: **Agni** is the son of Va-yu; vāyor-**agniḥ** (**Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** 8.1), either as genitive rated, in the character of digestive warmth, by the vital airs, or as having been excited into flame by the wind at the time of creation; Measurer of the two world: dvīmātṛ may relate to the wind inconjunction with Agni, as the occupants of the firmament and the earth, respectively; or, explained as the son of two mothers, or the two sticks used for attrition, and hence, applicable to Agni; Learned in the three kinds of sacrifice: Or, trimantu, acquaintd with the **pāka-yajñas**, or offering sof food; the **havir yajñas**, or oblations of clarified butter, and the **soma yajñas**, or libations of **Soma**. Trimantu = Kakṣīvat
