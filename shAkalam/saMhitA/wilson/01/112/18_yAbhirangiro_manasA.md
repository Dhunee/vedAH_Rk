## English translation:

“**Aṅgiras**, (prise the **Aśvins**); Aśvins, with those aids by which, with (gratified) minds, you delight (in praise), and thence preceded the gods to the cavern, to recover the stolen cattle; by which you sustained the heroic **Manu** with food; with them, Aśvins, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sustained Manu: By making him aware of the grain hidden in the earth, or teaching him, in fact, agriculture
