## English translation:

“With those aids by which you encompassed the sun, when afar off, (to extricate him from eclipse); by which you defended **Mandhātā** in (the discharge of) his soverign functions, and by whciḥ you protected the sage **Bharadvāja**; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mandhātā was a **rājaṛṣi**, a royal sage. Māndhātrā is a celebrated prince of the solar dynasty (Viṣnu **Purāṇa**, 363);

Kṣetrapati = lord, either of fields or of the earth. Bharadvāja, **vipra** = **brāhmaṇa**, **medhāvin**, wise (Viṣnu Purāṇa 449)
