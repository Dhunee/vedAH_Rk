## English translation:

“Showerers (of benefits), with those aids by which you enabled (the lame) Parāvṛj (to walk), the blind (**Ṛjraśva**) to see, and (the cripple) **Śroṇa** to go, and by which you set free the quail when seized (by a wolf); with those aids, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parāvṛj, Ṛraśva and Śroṇa were ṛṣis. Prāndha was a totally blind ṛṣi (Ṛjraśva); Śroṇa is said to have been made to walk, though not a cripple. **Vārttika** = quail, may also be a bird like a sparrow
