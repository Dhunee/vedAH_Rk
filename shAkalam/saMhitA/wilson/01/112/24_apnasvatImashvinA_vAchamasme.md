## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, sanctify our words with works; showerers (of benefits), subduers of foes (invigorate) our understandin g(for the sacred study); we invoke you both, in the last watch of the night, for our preservation; be to us for increase in the provision of food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Adyūtye, in the absense of light, i.e. in the last watch of the night, or that preceding the dawn, at which time, according to **Āśvalāyana** **Śrauta Sūtra**, the Aśvins are especially to be worshipped
