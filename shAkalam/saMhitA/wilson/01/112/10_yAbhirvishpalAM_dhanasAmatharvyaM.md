“With those aids by which you enabled the opulent Viśpalā, when she was unable to move, to go to the battle rich in a thousand spoils, and by which you protected the devout **Vaśa**, the son of **Aśva**; with them, **Aśvins**, come willingly hither.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Viśpalā was the wife of Khela, son of **Agastya**. Vaśa and **Asva** were ṛṣis
