## English translation:

“Let not the maternal waters swallow me, since the slaves hurled down this decrepit (old man); in like manner as Traitana wounded his head, so has the slave wounded his own, and has struck his breast and shoulders.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vitakṣat = imperative, takṣatu: tasmāt sa **dāsaḥ** svayam svakīyam eva **śiras** takṣatu, therefore may that slave of his own accord wound his own head. The silent repetition of the hymn is said to be a sure protection against a murderer, a wolf, or a tiger; particularly, a traveller is asked to repeat it for three times, until sunrise
