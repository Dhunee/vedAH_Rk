## English translation:

“May the praise addressed to you, **Aśvins**, preserve the son of Ucatthya; let not those revolving (days and nights) exhaust me; let not the ten times kindled fire consume me; let it not be, that one who is your, (dependant), bound (with bonds), should of himself bite the earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Should of himself bite the earth: tmani khādate kṣām = lit. by himself he eats the earth; i.e. being unable, from age and infirmity, to walk, he crawls or rolls on the ground
