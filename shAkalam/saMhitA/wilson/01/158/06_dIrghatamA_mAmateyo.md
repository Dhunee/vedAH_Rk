## English translation:

“**Dīrghatamas**, the son of **Mamatā**, has grown old after the tenth **yuga** (has passed); he is the **Brahmā** of those who seek to obtain the object of their (pious) works; he is their charioteer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He is the Brahmā: apām **artham** yatīnām brahmā **bhavati** **sārathiḥ**: he is the Brahmā, like **Brahma** (brahmā brahmāsadṛśaḥ parivṛḍhaḥ bhavati), the great, the chief;

Parivṛḍha = the progenitor,or creator of people. apām = apkāryāṇām, of those by whom offerings of water, obsequial libations to the manes are to be made; or, apām = apasam, of works, religious rites in genitive ral;

Sāratiḥ = lit. a charioteer; i.e. a conveyer, to heaven, a deity
