## English translation:

“The golden-haired **Agni** is the agitator of the clouds when the rain is poured forth, and, moving with the swiftness of the wind, shines with a bright radiance. The mornings know not (of the showers, like honest (people), who, provided with food, are intent upon their own labours.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Satyaḥ**, true, sincere; **prajāḥ**, people or progeny is added
