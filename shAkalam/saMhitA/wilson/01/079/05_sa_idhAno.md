## English translation:

“He, the blazing **Agni**, who is wise, and the granter of dwellings, is to be praised by our hymns; oḥ! you whose mouth (glows) with many (flames), shine (propitiously, so) that food-providing wealth may be ours.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

With many (flames); purvaṇīka, from **puru**, many and **anīka**, face or mouth; **jvālā**-**jihvā**, flame-tongued is Agni
