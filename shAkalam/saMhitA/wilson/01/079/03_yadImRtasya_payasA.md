## English translation:

“When this, (the lightning, **Agni**), nourishes the world with the milk of the rain, and conducts it by the most direct ways to (the enjoyment of) water, then **Mitra**, **Aryaman**, **Varuṇa** and the circumambient (troop of **Maruts**) pierce through the (investing) membrane into the womb of the cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Direct ways: uses (as drinking, washing, bathing)
