## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, the best of all beings, the assailer and humiliator (of your foes), the chief ot the **Ṛbhus**, the friend of man, the subduer of enemies, did aid the young and illustrious **Kutsa**, and slew Śuṣna, in the deadly and close-fought fight.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhukṣa = Ṛbhūnām **adhipati**; teṣu kṛtanivāsaḥ, he who abides in the Ṛbhus;

**Ṛbhu** = a wise man, a sage (**medhāvin**)
