## English translation:

“**Indra**, you are the mighty one, who, becoming manifest in (the hour of) alarm, did sustain by your energies heaven and earth; then, through fear of you, all creatures, and the mountains, and all other vast and solid things, trembled, like the (tremulous) rays of the sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By your energies: balaiḥ = by strength;

Śuṣmaiḥ = the driers up (of enemies)
