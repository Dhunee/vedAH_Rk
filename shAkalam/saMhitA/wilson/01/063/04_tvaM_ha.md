## English translation:

“You verily did animate him to (acquire) such (renown) as that which, sender of rain and wielder of the thunderbolt, you (dis-acquire) when you slew **Vṛtra**, and when, munificent hero, who easily conquer (your foes) you did put to fight the **Dasyus** in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dasyus are enemies of **Kutsa**: kutsasyopakṣayatāraḥ
