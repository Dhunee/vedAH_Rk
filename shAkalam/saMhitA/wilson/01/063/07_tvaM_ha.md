## English translation:

“**Indra**, wielder of the thunderbolt, warring on behalf of **Purukutsa**, you did overturn the seven cities; you did cut off for **Sudāsa** wealth of Aṅhas, as if (it had been a tuft) of sacred grass, and did give it to him, O king, ever satiating you (with oblations).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Purukuts ais a ṛṣi. Sudāsa is a king. Aṅas is an **asura**
