## English translation:

“We invoke, from heaven, with reverence, him who has excellent food, who is radiant, and has braided hair, who is brilliant, and is to be ascertained (by sacred study), holding in his **hands** excellent medicaments; mayhe grant us health, defensive armour, and a (secure) dwelling.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Him who has excellent food: **varāha**, lit. a boar and one who has a hard body, like a boar; this is an abbrieviation of varāhāra, from **vara**, good, and **āhāra**, food
