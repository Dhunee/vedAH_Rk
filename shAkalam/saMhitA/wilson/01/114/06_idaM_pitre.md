## English translation:

“This praise, the sweetest of the sweet, and cause of increase (to the reciter), is addressed to **Rudra**, the father of the **Maruts**; immortal Rudra, grant us food sufficient for mortals, and bestow happiness on me, my son, and my grandson.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rudra, the father of the Maruts: 'After their birth from **Diti**, under the circumstances told in the **Purāṇas** (**Viṣṇu Purāṇa**), they were behdl in deep affliction by **Śiva** and **Pārvati** as they were passing sportively along; the latter sid to the former, "If you love me, transform these lumps of flesh into boys". **Maheśa** accordingly made them boys of like form, like age, and similarly accoutered, and gave them to Pārvati, as her sons, whence they are called the sons of Rudra.' Hence, maruts are the sons of Rudra. Another legend: Pārvati, hearing the lamentations of Diti, entreated Śiva to give the shapeless births, forms, telling them not to weep (mā rodiḥ); another, that he actually begot them, in the form of a bull, on **Pṛthivī**, the earth, as a cow
