## English translation:

“Be gracious to us, **Rudra**; grant us happiness, for we worship the destroyer of heroes with oblations; and, by your directions, Rudra, may we obtain that freedom from disease and exemption from dangers which our progenitor, **Manu**, bestowed upon us, (having obtained them form the gods).”
