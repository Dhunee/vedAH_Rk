## English translation:

“Of whom, or of which divinity of the immortals, shall we invoke the auspicious name? who will give us to the great **Aditi** that I may again behold my father and my mother.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aditi =earth;

**Adit** = earth. **Rāmāyaṇa**, b.i, ch.61 presents Śunahśepas, son of the Ṛṣis Ṛcika and is sold for a hundred cows by his father to Ambaṛṣa, king of **Ayodhyā**, as a victim for a human sacrifice. He sees **Viśvāmitra**, near the lake **Puṣkara** and learns a prayer when repeated at the stake induces **Indra** to come and set him free. **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** has the legend: the **rājā** is **Hariścandra**, who has no sons and worships **Varuṇa** to obtain a son and promises to sacrifice to him his first-born. He gets a son, named **Rohita**; when Varuṇa claims this son, the king delays the sacrifice using various pretexts, until Rohita attains adolescence. When Rohita is told of the rājā's commitment to Varuṇa, **Rohina** refuses to submit himself and moves into the forests. In the forest, Rohita meets a ṛṣi, Ājīgartta who is in great distress. Rohita person ades the ṛṣi to part with his second son, Śunahśepas, to be substituted for Rohita as an offering to Varuṇa. The deal is struck and Śunahśepas is about to be sacrificed. On the advice of Viśvāmitra, an officiating priest, Śunahśepas appeals to the gods and is ultimately liberated. This hymn is uttered by Śunahśepas when bound to the **Yūpa**, or stake, as the **puruṣaḥ**-**paśuḥ**, the man-animal (or victim), as the **Bhāgavata** terms him: "Of whom" (**kasya**) may also be rendered; of **Brahmā** or **Prajāpati** (also called ka): as ko ha vai **nāma** **prajāpatiḥ** (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 3.21; 7.26)
