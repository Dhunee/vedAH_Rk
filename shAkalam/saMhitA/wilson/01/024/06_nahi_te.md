## English translation:

“These birds, that are flying (through the air), have not obtained, **Varuṇa**, your bodily strength or your prowess, or (are able to endure your) wrath; neither do these waters that flow increasingly, nor (do the gales) of wind, surpass your speed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Savitā** refers Śunahśepas to Varuṇa
