## English translation:

“**Varuṇa**, loosen for me the upper, the middle, the lower band; so, son of **Aditi**, shall we, through faultlessness in the worship, become freed from siṇ”

Reference to the ligature fastening the head, the feet, and the waist; resulting in loosening from the bonds of sin: anāgasaḥ **syāma**, may we be sinless
