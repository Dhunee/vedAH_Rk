## English translation:

“Let us invoke the auspicious name of **Agni**, the first divinity of the immortals, that he may give us to the great **Aditi**, and that I may behold agin my father and my mother.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**: **Prajāpati** said to Śunahśepas: 'Have recourse to Agni, who is the nearest of the gods'; upon this, he resorted to Agni. Tam prajāpati-ruvācāgnirvai devānām nediṣṭhastam evopadhāveti: so Agnim upasasāra
