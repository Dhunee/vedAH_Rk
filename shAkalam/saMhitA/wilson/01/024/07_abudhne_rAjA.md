## English translation:

“The regal **Varuṇa**, of pure vigour (abiding) in the baseless (firmament), sustains on high a heap of light, the rays (of which) are pointed downwards, while their base is above; may they become concentrated in us as the sources of existence.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abudhne = in the baseless; **mūla**-rahite = antarikṣe, in the sky; vanasya stūpam = attribute: **tejasaḥ**, radiance;

Saṅgham = a heap; Varuṇa is an **Āditya**
