## English translation:

“Praising you with (devout) prayer, I implore you for that (life) which the instrumental tutor of the sacrifice solicits with oblations; **Varuṇa**, undisdainful, bestow a thought upon us; much-lauded, take not away our existence.”

The term, tadāyus is supplied in the context of **māna** āyuḥ pramoṣiḥ = do not take away our life
