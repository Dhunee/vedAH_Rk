## English translation:

“These constellations plural ced on high, which are visible by night, and go elsewhere by day, are the undisturbed holy acts of **Varuṇa** (and by his command) the moon moves resplendent by night.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ṛkṣāḥ**, constellations may be seven Ṛṣis, Ursa Major or constellations, in genitive ral. Constellations and the mo9on shine because of Varuṇa's piety (varuṇasya vratāni) since they shine by his command. A reference to asterisms: varuṇasya karmāṇi **nakṣatra**-darśanādirūpāṇi
