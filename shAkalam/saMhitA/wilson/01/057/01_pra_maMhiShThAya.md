## English translation:

“I offer especial praise to the most bountiful, the excellent, th eopulent, the verily powerful and stately **Indra**, whose irresistible impetuosity is like (the rush) of waters down a precipice, and by whom widely-diffused wealth is laid open (to his worshippers) to sustain (their) strength.”
