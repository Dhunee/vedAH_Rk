## English translation:

“All the world, **Indra**, was intent upon your worship; the oblations of the sacrificer (flowed) like water (falling) to a depth); for the fatal golden thunderbolt of Indra, when hurling it (against the foe), did not sleep upon the mountain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Did not sleep upon the mountain = against the side of **Vṛtra**
