## English translation:

“Beautiful Uṣas, now present the oblation in this rite to the formidable, praise-deserving **Indra**, whose all-sustaining, celebrated, and characteristic radiance has impelled him hither and thither, (in quest) of (sacrificial) food, as (a charioteer drives) his horses (in various directions).”
