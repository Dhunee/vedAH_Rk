## English translation:

“Veracious (**Indra**) has risen up (as ardently) as a horse (approaches) a mare, to partake of the copious libations (contained) in the (sacrificial) ladles; having stayed his well-horsed, golden, and splendid chariot, heplies himself, capable of heroid (actions with **Soma**).”
