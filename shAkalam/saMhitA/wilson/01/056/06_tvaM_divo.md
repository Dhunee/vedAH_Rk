## English translation:

“You, mighty **Indra**, send down from the heaven by your power, upon the realms of earth, the (world) sustaining rain; exhilarated (by **Soma**), you have expelled the waters (from the clouds), and have crushed **Vṛtra** by a solid rock.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śamayā pāṣyā = **sama**, whole, entire; hence, **pāṣya** may mean a stone (or a spear?)
