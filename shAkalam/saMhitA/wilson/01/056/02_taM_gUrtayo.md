## English translation:

“His adorers, bearing oblations, are thronging round (him), as (merchants) covetous of gain crowd the ocean (in vessels) on a voyage ascend quickly, with a hymn to the powerful **Indra**, the protector of the solemn sacrifice, as wome (climb) a mountain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Women climb a hill to gather flowers
