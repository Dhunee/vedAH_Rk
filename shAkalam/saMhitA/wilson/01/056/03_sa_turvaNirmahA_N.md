## English translation:

“He is quick in action, and mighty; his faultless and desructive prowess shines in manly (conflict) like the peak of a mountain (afar), with which, clothed in metal (armour), he, the supressor of the malignant, when exhilarated (by **Soma**), cast the wily **Śuṣṇa** into prison and into bonds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Āyasaḥ** = of iron, i.e. whose body is defended by armour of metal; an intimation of **Indra** as an idol
