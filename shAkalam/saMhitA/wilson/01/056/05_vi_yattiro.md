## English translation:

“. When you, destroying **Indra**, did distribute the (previously) hidden life-sustaining, undecaying waters through the different quarters of the heaven, then, animated (by **Soma**), you did engage in battle, and with exulting (prowess) slew **Vṛtra**, and did send down an ocean of waters.”
