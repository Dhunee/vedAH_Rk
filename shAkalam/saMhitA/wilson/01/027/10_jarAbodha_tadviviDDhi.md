## English translation:

“Jarābodha, enter into the oblation for the completion of the sacrifice that benefits all mankind; the worshipper offers agreeable laudation to the terrible (**Agni**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Jarābodha = he who is awakened (**bodha**) by praise (**jarā**); **rudra** is equated with the fierce or cruel Agni: krurāya Agnaye
