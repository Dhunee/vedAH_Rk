## English translation:

“All living beings adore her, that she may be visible; bringer of good, she lights up the world; the affluent daughter of heaven drives away the malevolent and disperses the absorbers (of moisture).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sridhaḥ: śoṣayitṛn = the driers up; an allusion to the clouds which take up the dew of night?
