## English translation:

“She animates the diligent, and sends clients (to their patrons); and shedder of dews, knows not delay; bestower of food, at your rising the soaring birds no longer suspend (their flight).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Arthinaḥ visṛjati = she lets loose the solicitors; the explanation: te (yācakaḥ) uṣahkāle samutthāya svakīyadātṛgṛhe gacchanti, they, having risen at early morning, go to the houses of those who are their respective benefactors
