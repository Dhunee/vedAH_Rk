## English translation:

“Abounding with horses, abounding with kine, bestowers of every sort of wealth, (the divinities of morning) are possessed of much that is necessary for the habitations (of men); Uṣas, speak to me kind words; send us the affluence of the wealthy.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The epithets of Uṣas are in feminine plural, without a substantive: aśvavatiḥ, **gomatiḥ**, viśvasuvidaḥ; hence, assumed: uṣo-**devataḥ**, the many divinities of dawn
