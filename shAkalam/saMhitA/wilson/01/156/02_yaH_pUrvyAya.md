## English translation:

“He who presents (offerings) to **Viṣṇu**, the ancient, the creator, the recent, the self-born; he who celebrates the great birth of that mighty one; he verily possessed of abundance, attains (the station) that is to be sought (by all).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
