## English translation:

“Hymners, propitiate of your own accord that ancient **Viṣṇu**, since you know him as the germ of sacrifice, cognizant of his greatness, celebrate his name; may we, Viṣṇu, enjoy your favour.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Propitiate of your own accord: januṣā pipartana = lit. plural ase or propitiate (him) by your birth; i.e. **svata** eva, of yourself or spontaneously, not from any interested motive: na kenacid **vara** lābhādinā; the germ of sacrifice: ṛtasya garbham, born as one with sacrifice (yajño vai **viṣṇuḥ**: **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.1.2.13); verily (is) Viṣṇu; or, if ṛta keep the sense of water, then the phrase applies to Viṣṇu as the cause or creator of water: apa eva sasarja ādau (**Manu** 1.8), in the beginning he created water
