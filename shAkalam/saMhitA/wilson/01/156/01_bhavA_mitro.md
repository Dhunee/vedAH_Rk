## English translation:

“Be (to us), **Viṣṇu**, like a friend, the giver of happiness, the acepter of oblations, abounding with food, the granter of protection, and every way accessible; on which account your praise is to be repeatedly recited by the wise, and your worship to be celebrated by the offerer of oblations.”
