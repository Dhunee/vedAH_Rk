## English translation:

“He amongst those (who are your followers), who observes truth, who is considerate, who is commended by the wise, who is able to (inflict) harm, carefully weighs (the means whereby), fierce and well-armed, he slays (a foe) less efficiently accoutred, and (by which) the revilers of the gods, however mighty, may perish.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Etaccana tvā eṣām = etayor madhye tvasvana ekaḥ, one of you tow, the plural ral is honorific; **Mitra** or **Varuṇa**,if one of you can do such things (etad), how much more irresistible must you be together; or, eṣām = tad **anucara**, their followers of worshippers; triraśrim. hanti caturaśriḥ = lit. he who has a quadrangular weapon kills him who has a triangular one; i.e. implying one with most arms or weapons, adhikāyudhavān is more than a match for one who has fewer or inferior arms or weapons
