## English translation:

“Without steeds, without stay, (he is nevertheless) borne swift-moving and loud-sounding; he travels, ascending higher and higher, connecting the inconceivable mystery (of sacred rites) with the radiance (abiding) in **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, (which men), eulogizing, glorify.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Connecting the inconceivable mystery: acittambrahma **yuvānaḥ**: acittam = **citta** aviṣayam,not an object of the mind or thought;

**Brahma** = parivṛḍham uktarūpam **karma**, the act of which the nature is declared very great
