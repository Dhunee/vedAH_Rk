## English translation:

“May the cow, propitious to the devout son of **Mamatā**, be possessed of well-filled udders; knowing the rites (necessary to be performed), let him beg (the residue) of the offerings for his eating, and worshipping (you both) complete the perfect (ceremony).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be possessed of well-filled udders: To supply appropriate offerings to **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, who are the products of milk: mitrāvaruṇābhyām payasyeti śruteḥ; let him beg: pitvo bhikṣeta, let him beg of or for food, i.e., for what is not consumed in oblations
