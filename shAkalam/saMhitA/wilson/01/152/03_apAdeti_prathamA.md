## English translation:

“Who knows, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, that it is your doing, that the footless dawn is the precursor of footed beings; and that your infant (progeny, the sun), sustains the burden of this (world); he diffuses (the) truth (of light), and disperses the falsehood (of darkness).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mitra and Varuṇa (ahorātre vai mitrāvaruṇau--**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.4.10.1) are respectively the divinities presiding over day and night, consequently the break of day, and the course of the sun, may be considered as their work; the dawn is termed apād or footless, or not moving by its own feet or steps, but as depending upon the motion of the sun.
