## English translation:

“Robust **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, you wear vestments (of light); your natures are to be regarded as without defect; you annihilate all untruths; you associate (us) with sacrifice.”

Robust: pīvasā = pīnau, fat, stout, as an epithet of **Mitrāvaruṇa**; or, acchinnāni, untorn; vastrāṇi, garments; or, in the 3rd case, singular, with great or intense radiance, tejasā
