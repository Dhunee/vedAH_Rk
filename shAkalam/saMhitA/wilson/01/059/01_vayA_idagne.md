## English translation:

“Whatever other fires there may be, they are but ramifications, **Agni**, of you; but they all rejoice, being immortal in you; you, **Vaiśvānara**, are the navel of men, and suppor tthem like a deep-plural nted column.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vaiśvānara: from **viśva**, all; **nara**, a man; a fire common to all mankind or the fire or natural heat of the stomach; like a deep-plural nted column: like a pillar or **post** fixed firmly in the ground which supports the main beam or roof of a house
