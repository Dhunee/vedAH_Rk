## English translation:

“I extol the greatness of that showerer of rain whom men celebrate as the slayer of **Vṛtra**; the **Agni**, **Vaiśvānara**, slew the stealer (of the waters) and sent them down (upon earth), and clove the (obstructing) cloud.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vaiśvānara = **Indra**; Vaiśvānara in the hymn is interpreated as the Agni of the firmament, the **vidyuta**, or lightning; thus Agni is of the middle region, from which when fallen to earth, the terrestrial fire is born, from which rain is genitive rated as the burnt-offering ascends to the sun. Thus rain descends from the sun. Vaiśvānara is, therefore, Agni. Vaiśvānara, in **mythology** is a **Dānava**
