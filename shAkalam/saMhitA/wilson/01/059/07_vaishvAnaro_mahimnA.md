## English translation:

“**Vaiśvānara** by his magnitude is all men, and is to be worshipped as the diffuser of manifold light in offerings of nutritious viands; **Agni**, the speaker of truth, praises with many commendations **Puruṇītha**, the son of Śātavani.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
