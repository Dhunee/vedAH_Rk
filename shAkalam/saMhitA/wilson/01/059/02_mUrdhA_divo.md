## English translation:

“**Agni**, the head of heaven, the navel of earth, became the ruler over both earth and heaven; all the gods engendered you, **Vaiśvānara**, in the form of light, for the venerable sage.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This is the first verse of a tṛca to be recited on the day of the equinox. Agni is the head of heaven, as the principal element; Agni is the navel of earth, as its main source of support. Āryāya may refer to **Manu** as the instrumental tutor of the first sacrifice or to the **yajamāna**, the instrumental tutor of the present rite
