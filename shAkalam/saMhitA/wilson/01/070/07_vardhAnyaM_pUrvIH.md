## English translation:

“\[7-8\] **Agni**, whom many variously-tinted (mornings) and nights increase, whom, invested with truth, all moveable and immoveable things augment, has been propitiated, and is kindly seated at the holy rite, as the invoker (of the gods), and rendering all (pious) acts (productive) of reward.”
