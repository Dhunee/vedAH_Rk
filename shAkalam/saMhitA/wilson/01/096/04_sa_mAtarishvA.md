## English translation:

“May **Agni**, the dweller in the firmament, the nourisher with abundant benefits, the bestower of **svarga**, the protector of mankind, the progenitor of heaven and earth, instrumental uct my sons in the right way; the gods retain Agni as the giver of (sacrificial) wealth.”
