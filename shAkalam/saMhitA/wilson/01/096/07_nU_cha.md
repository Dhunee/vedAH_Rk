## English translation:

“The gods retain **Agni** as the giver of (sacrificial) wealth, who now is, and heretofore has been, the abode of riches, the receptacle of all that has been, and all that will be, born, and the preserver of all (that) exists, (as well as of all) that are coming into existence.”
