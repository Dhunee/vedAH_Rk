## English translation:

“Approachinghim,let all men adore **Agni**, the chief (of the gods), the accomplisher of sacrifices, who is gratified by oblations and propitiated by praises--the offspring of food, the sustainer of (all men), the giver of continual gifts; the gods retain Agni as the giver of (sacrificial) wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Prathama** = lit. the first; here, mukya, chief (of the gods)
