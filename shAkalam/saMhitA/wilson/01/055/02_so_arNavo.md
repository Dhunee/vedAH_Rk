## English translation:

“The firmament-abiding **Indra** graps the wide-spread waters with his comprehenisve faculties, as the ocean (receives the rivers); he rushes (impetuous) as a bull, to **drik** of the **Soma**; he, the warrior, even covets praise for his prowess.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gṛbhṇāti varīmabhiḥ, he graps with his powers of comprehending or collecting (saṃvaraṇaiḥ) or may be, his vastness (urutvaiḥ)
