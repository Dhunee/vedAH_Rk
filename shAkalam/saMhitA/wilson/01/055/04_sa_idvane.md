## English translation:

“He verily is glorified by adoring (sages) in the forest; he proclaims his beautiful vigour amongst men ; he is the granter of their wishes (to those who solicit him); he is the encourager of those who desire to worship (him), when the wealthy offerer of oblations, enjoying his protection, recites his praise.”
