## English translation:

“The amplitude of **Indra** was vaster than the (space of) heaven; earth was not comparable to him in bulk; formidable and most mighty, he has been ever the afflicter (of the enemies of) those men (who worship him); he has his thunderbolt for sharpness, as a bull (his horns).”
