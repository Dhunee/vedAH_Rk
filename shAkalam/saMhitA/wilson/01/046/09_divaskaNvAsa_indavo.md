## English translation:

“**Kaṇvas** (ask this of the **Aśvins**); (How) do the rays (of the sun proceed) from the sky? (How) does the dawn (rise) in the region of the waters? Where do you desire to manifest your own person ns?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Lit. the text is: 'Rays from the sky, Kaṇvas, cause of dwelling in the plural ce of the rivers; where do you wish to plural ce own form?' The added assumption is that Kaṇvas are asked to inquire of the Aśvins the questions posed in the translation
