## English translation:

“May our sin, **Agni**, be repented of; manifest riches to us; may our sin be repented of.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agham apa naḥ śośucad: from śuc, to sorrow, with the vedic imperative apa (let) prefixed; two interpretations: 'let our sin pass away from us, and light upon our adversaries'; or 'let our sin, afected by grief, perish'
