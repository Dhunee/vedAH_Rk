## English translation:

“Destroyers of foes, no adversary of yours is known above the heavens, nor (is any) upon earth; may your collective strength be quickly exerted, sons of **Rudra**, to humble (your enemies).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rudrāsaḥ: **rudra-putraḥ**, sons of Rudra, perhaps a reference to the protection by Rudra
