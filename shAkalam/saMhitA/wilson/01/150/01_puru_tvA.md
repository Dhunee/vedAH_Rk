## English translation:

“Presenting many offerings, I address you, **Agni**, ever coming into your presence (like a servant) in the dwelling of a mighty master.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like a servant: arir agne tava svidā: ari = enemy, assailant **amitra**, unfriend (**Nirukta** 5.7); the word is equated with artā, a servant, in the character of bringing oblations and the like before Agni: yato aham agne tava svit tavaiva ā abhimukhyena arir artā havirādi prāpaṇena sevako aham, 'Since I, Agni, going verily into your presence for the purpose of conveying oblations, I am a servant'. A mighty master: todasya, a governor, a master; śikṣakasya svāminaḥ = lit. a tormentor, a tyrant
