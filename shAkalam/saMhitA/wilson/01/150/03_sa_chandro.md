A moon in heaveṅ so candro maryaḥ: he becomes like the moon the rejoicer of all, āhlādakaḥ sarveṣām; or, he even becomes the moon, **candra** eva **bhavati**; according to the Chandogās: candratvaprāptim chandogā āmananti, the Chandogās are authority for obtaining the condition of the moon; pitṛlokādākāśam ākāśāc-candramasam eṣa somo **rājā**, from the region of the **pitṛs** to the **ākāśa**; from ākāśa to the moon, this is **soma**, the king. **Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad** also refers to: dyulokaprāptiḥ, the attainement of heaven
