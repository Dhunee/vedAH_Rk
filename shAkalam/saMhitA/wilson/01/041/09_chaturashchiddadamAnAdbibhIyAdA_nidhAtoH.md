## English translation:

“For he (the worshipper) loves not, but fears to speak evil (of any one), as a gamester fears (his adversary) holding the four (dice), until they are thrown.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Caturaścid dadamānād vibhīyād-ā-nidhātoḥ, he may fear from one holding four until the fail; explained as: caturo akṣān dhārayataḥ kitavat = from a gambler holding four dice. The dice are four cowrie shells, **kapardakaḥ**
