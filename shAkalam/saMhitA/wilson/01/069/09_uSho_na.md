## English translation:

“\[9-10\] May **Agni**, who is possessed of manifold light, like the extinguisher of the dawn, the granter of dwellings, and of cognizable form, consider (the desires of) this, (his worshipper); (his rays), spontaneously bearing the oblation, open the doors (of the sacrificial chamber), and all spread through the visible heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uṣo na **jāraḥ**: extinguisher of the dawn, is explained by jarayitrī, the causer of decay. The dawn is obliterated by the superior radiance of the sun
