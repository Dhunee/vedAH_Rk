## English translation:

“\[1-2\] White-shining (**Agni**), like the (sun), the extinguisher of the dawn, is the illuminator (of all) and fills united (heaven and earth with light), like the lustre of the radiant (sun). You, as soon as manifested, have pervaded all the world with devout acts, being (both) the father and son of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Devānām **pitā** **putraḥ** san: the protector, either of the gods or of the priests (ṛtvijam) and their messenger, that is, at their command, like a son. Metaphorically, Agni, as the bearer of oblations, is said to give paternal support to the gods; he is their son as the presenter of sacrificial offerings to them
