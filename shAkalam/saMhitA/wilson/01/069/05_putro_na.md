## English translation:

“\[5-6\] He diffuses happiness in a dwelling like a son(newly) born; he overcomes (opposing) men like an animated charger; whatever (divine) beings I may along with other men invoke (to the ceremony), you, **Agni**, assume all (their) celestial nature.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tad devatarupo **bhavati**: he becomes of the form or nature of that deity; **tvan** agne varuṇo jāyate tvam mitro bhavasi: you are born as **Varuṇa**, you become **Mitra**
