## English translation:

“You mount your chariot willingly, **Indra**, for the sake of drinking the libations; such as you delight in having been prepared (at the sacrifice of) **Śāryāta**; be plural ased with them, as you are gratified by the effused **Soma** (at the sacrifices) of others, so do you obtain imperishable fame in heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Śaryāta** was a **rājaṛṣi**, descent from **Bhṛgu**. **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**: he was a prince of the Mnau lineage. Śāryāta is a descendant of **Śaryāti**, the fourth son of **Manu** **Vaivasvata**. Ṛṣi **Cyavana** married his daughter at a solemn sacrifice attended by Indra and **Aśvins**. Cyavana took the share of the oblations intended for the Aśvins. This act made Indra angry; to appease Indra another sacrifice was prepared. The legend is cited from **Kauśitaki** (the legend is also noted in the **Bhāgavata** and **Padma Purāṇas**).
