## English translation:

“You have opened the receptacle of the waters; you have detained in the mountain the treasure of the malignant; when you had slain **Vṛtra**, the destryer, you made the sun visible in the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Parvate danumad **vasu** = in the mountain, a dwelling of **Indra**;

Danumad = descended from **Danu**, a **Dānava**, an **asura** or an epithet of vasu, wealth, fit for liberality (from danu, giving) or one doing injury, an enemy; Vṛtra (Ahi) is hantri, the slayer; so yat sarvān etat samabhavat tasmād ahiriti, inasmuch as he was the same as all that (benefits of sacrifice, fame, knowledge, prosperity), he wa called Ahi
