## English translation:

“Anime with praises that ram, (**Indra**), who is adored by many, who is gratified by hymns, and is an ocean of wealth; whose good deeds spread abroad for the benefit of mankind, like the rays of light; worship the powerful and wise Indra, for the enjoyment of prosperity.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tyam. meṣam: Indra assumed the form of a ram and came to a sacrifice performed by **Medhātithi** and drank **Soma**, so a legend;

**Meṣa** = victor over foes. Another legend is that **Aṅgiras** worshipped to get a son who would resemble Indra; Indra himself became his son whose name was **Savya**
