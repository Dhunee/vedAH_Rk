## English translation:

“You have opened the cloud for the **Aṅgirasas** you have shown the way to **Atri**, who vexes his adversaries by a hundred doors (by a number of **yantras**, means or contrivances); you have granted wealth, with food, to **Vimada**; you are wielding your thunderbolt in defence of a worshipper engaged in battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Gotra** = herd of cattle or a cloud;

**Gotrabhid** = mountain-breaker with his thunderbolt (**Indra**) or may allude to the recovery of cows stolen by **Paṇi**;;

Vimada = a **maharṣi**
