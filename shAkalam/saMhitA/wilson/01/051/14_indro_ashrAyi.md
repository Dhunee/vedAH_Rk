## English translation:

“**Indra** has been had recourse to, that he may assist the pious in their distress. Praise by the Pajras, is (as stable) as the **post** of a doorway. Indra, the giver of riches, who is possessed of (who desires to possess, expecting as gifts from the instrumental tutor of the ceremony) horses, cattle, chariots and wealth is present.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pajras = **Aṅgirasas**
