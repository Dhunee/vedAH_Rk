## English translation:

“You have given, **Indra**, the youthful Vṛcaya to the aged **Kakṣīvat**, praising you and offering oblations; you, **Śatakratu**, were **Menā**, the daughter of **Vṛṣaṇaśva**; all these your deeds are to be recited at your worship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vṛcaya was given to Kakṣīvat at a **rājasūya** ceremony. Indra became Menā, the daughter of Vṛṣaṇaśva and later, also fell in love with her. Menā is a daughter of **Pitṛs** by **Svadhā** and the wife of **Himavat**, king of mountains
