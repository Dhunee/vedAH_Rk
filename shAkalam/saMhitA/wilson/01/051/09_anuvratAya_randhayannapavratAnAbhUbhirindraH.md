## English translation:

“**Indra** abides, humbling the neglecters of holy acts in favour of those who observe them; and punishing those who turn away from his worship in favour of those who are present (with their praise); Vamra, while praising him, whether old or adolescent, and spreading through heaven, carried off the accusative ulated (materials of the sacrifice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vamro vijaghāna samdihaḥ = vamra destryed the collections. Vamra, a ṛṣi, when Indra was absent, carried away the accusative ulated heap of offerings, the marrow or essence of the earth, yad **valmika**-vap_sambhāro **bhavati** ūrjjam eva pṛthivyāḥ
