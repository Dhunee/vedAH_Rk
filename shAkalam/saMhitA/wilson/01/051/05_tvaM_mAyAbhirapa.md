## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, by the devices, have humbled the deceivers who presented oblations to their own mouths; propitious to men, you have destroyed the cities of Pipru, and have well defended Ṛjiśvan in robber-destroying (contest).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pipru is an **asura**; Ṛjiśvan is a worshipper whom they oppressed; **dasyu**-hatyeśu, in battles killing the **dasyus**
