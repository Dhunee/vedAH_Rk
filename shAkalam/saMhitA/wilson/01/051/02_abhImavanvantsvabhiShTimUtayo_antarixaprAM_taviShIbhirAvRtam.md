## English translation:

“The protecting and fostering **Ṛbhus** hastened to the presence of **Indra**, of graceful motion, and irradiating the firmament, imbued with vigour, the humiliator of his enemies, the performer of a hundred pious acts; and by them, encouraging words were uttered.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhus = **Maruts** who encouraged Indra; 'all gods who were your friends have fled; may there be friendship between the Maruts and you'. Indra is one of 12 **Ādityas**, as **Śakra**, hence 'irradiating the firmament'; words were uttered: **prahara** bhagava vīryasva, strike; **bhagavan**, be valiant
