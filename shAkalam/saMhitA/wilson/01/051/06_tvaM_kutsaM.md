## English translation:

“You have defended **Kutsa** in fatal fights with Śuśna; you have destroyed **Śambara** in defence of **Atithigva**; you have trodden with your foot upon the great **Arbuda**; frm remote times were you born for the destruction of oppressors.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śuśna, Śambara and Arbuda are **asuras**. Kutsa is a ṛṣi;

Atithigva = hospitable, **Divodāsa**
