## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, are king; they who are gods (are subject) to you; therefore, scatterer (of foes), do you protect and cherish us men; you are the protector of the good, the possessor of wealth, the extricator of us (from sin); you are true, the invester (of all with your lustre) the giver of strength.”
