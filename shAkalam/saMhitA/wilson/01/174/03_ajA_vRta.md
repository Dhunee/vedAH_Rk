## English translation:

“Go the cities inhabited by the **rākṣasas**, and thence to heaven (attended), receiver of many sacrifices by those who (attend you). Defend, like a lion, the untamed, quick-moving **Agni**, that he may abide in his dwelling, fulfilling his functions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To the cities inhabited by rākṣasas: **vṛtaḥ** **śura** patnīḥ = raksobhiḥ pālayitā vṛtaḥ **purīḥ**; defend like a lion: as a lion protects the forest, in which his lair is, from the depredations of other animals
