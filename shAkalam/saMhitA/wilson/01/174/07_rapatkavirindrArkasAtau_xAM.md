## English translation:

“The sage praises you, **Indra**, for the grant of desirable (food), since you have made the earth the bed of the **asura**; **Maghavan** has made the three (regions) marvellous by his gifts, and has destroyed for (the prince) Duryoṇi (the asura), Kuyavāca, in combat.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The three regions: **bhūmiḥ** is added to the term of the text, **tisraḥ**: either earth in three aspects as identical with the three rituals of the **darśa** or lunar periods; the **paśu** or victim; and **Soma**, or libation; or, as implying earth, firmament and heaven
