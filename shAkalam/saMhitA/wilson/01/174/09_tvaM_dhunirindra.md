## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, are the terrifier (of your foes); you have made the trembling waters overspread (the earth) like flowing rivers; but, hero, when you fill the ocean you have protected in their well-being **Turvaśa** and **Yadu**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like flowing rivers: **sīrāḥ** na sravantīḥ: **sīrā** may be a certain river; or river, in genitive ral; you have protected:pārayā turvaśam yadum **svasti**: pāraya = apālayaḥ, you have protected;

Svasti = avināśam, without loss or detriment;

Pāraya = bear across, convey over in safety
