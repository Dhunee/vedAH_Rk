## English translation:

“Let (your foes, **Indra**), humbled by the might of your thunderbolt rest in their own station, for your glory; when you move, (armed) with your weapons, you send down the waters; arresting your horses, increase, by your power, (the abundance of) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rest in their own station: in the firmament, the enemies are the clouds
