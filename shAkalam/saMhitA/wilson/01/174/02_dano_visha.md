## English translation:

“You have humbled the people, suing for pardon when you have destroyed their seven new cities; you the irrproachable have dispersed the flowing waters; you have destroyed **Vṛtra** for the sake of the youthful **Purukutsa**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You have humbled the people: dano **viśa** **indra** mṛdhravācas = make liberal men soft-spoken, dānamanaso manuṣyān indra mṛduvācaḥ **kuru**; another interpretation, based on rurhi, current aceptation: you have made the subject (rain), soliciting ofrbearance, descend (in showers); when you have rent asunder the gliding, world-filling (clouds), then, irreproachable one, you did make the wates flow in channels, and did open the chief cloud for young Purukutsa
