## English translation:

“The affluent and adorable Uṣas has sent her rays abroad, as (a cowherd drives) the cattle (to pasture), and spreads expansive, like flowing water; she is beheld associated with the rays of the sun, unimpeding sacred ceremonies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aminatī daivyāni vratāni = not injuring, i.e. favouring, divine rites to the gods, which are to be performed by daylight (after dawn): na rātrau na **sāyam** **asti** devāya ajuṣṭam = sacrifice is not acceptable to the gods at night, or in the evening (RV. 5.77.2)
