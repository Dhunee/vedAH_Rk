## English translation:

“Her brilliant light is first seen towards (the east); it spreads and disperses the thick darkness; she anoints her beauty as the priests anoint the sacrificial food in sacrifices; the daughter of the sky awaits the glorious sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Duhitā **divaḥ**, the daughter of heaven or the sky
