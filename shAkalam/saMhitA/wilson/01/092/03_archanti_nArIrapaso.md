## English translation:

“The feminine le leaders (of the morning) illuminate with their inherent radiance the remotest parts (of the heaven), with a simultaneous effort, like warriors (with their shining arms in the van of battle), bringing every kind of food to the performer of good works, to the bountiful, and to the worshipper who presents libations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Arcanti = lit. worship; i.e. illuminate the heavens, spreading over or extending; like warriors: the comparison is explained: 'as they spread with bright arms along the front of the array, so the rays of the dawn spread along the sky before the coming of the sun'
