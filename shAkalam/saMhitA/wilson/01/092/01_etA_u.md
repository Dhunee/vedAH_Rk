## English translation:

“These divinities of the morning have spread light (over the world); they make manifest the light in the eastern portion of the firmament, brightening all things, like warriors burnishing their weapons; the radiant and progressing mothers (of the earth), they travel daily (on their course).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uṣāsaḥ (plural): allusion to divinities that preside over the morning; **Yāska** notes that the plural is used honorifically (**Nirukta** 12.7); progressed mothers: **mātṛ** = maker, author; bhāso nirmātryaḥ: authors of light (Nirukta 12.7)
