## English translation:

“Uṣas cuts off the accusative ulated (glooms), as a barber (cuts off the hair); she bares her bosom as a cow yields her udder (to the milker); and, as cattle hasten to their pastures, she speeds to the east, and shedding light upon all the world, dissipates the darkness.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nṛtūr iva, like a barber;

Nṛtūḥ = a dancing-girl; alternative reading: uṣas displays graces, like a dancing-girl (peśaṃsi vapate, to cut off or possess either darkness or elegance)
