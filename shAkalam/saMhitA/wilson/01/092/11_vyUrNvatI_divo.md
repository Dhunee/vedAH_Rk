## English translation:

“She has been seen illuminating the boundaries of the sky, and driving into disappearance the spontaneously-retiring (night); wearing away the ages of the human race, she shines with light like the bride of the sun.”

Svasāram = svayam sarantim, going to her own accord (night);

**Jāra** = causer of the decay of night, explained as **Sūrya**
