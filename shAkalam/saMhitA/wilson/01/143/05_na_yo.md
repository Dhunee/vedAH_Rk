## English translation:

“**Agni**, who, like the roaring of the winds, like a victorious host, like the thunderbolt in heaven, is not to be arrested, devours and destroys (our foes) with sharpened teeth (bharva hiṃsāyām; bharvatirattikarmā: **Nirukta** 9.23), and, as a warrior (annihilates his enemies), he, (Agni), lays waste the woods.”
