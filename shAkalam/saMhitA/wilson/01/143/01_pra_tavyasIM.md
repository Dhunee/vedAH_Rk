## English translation:

“I offer devoutly to **Agni**, the son of strength, an invigorating and most new sacrifice, with words of adoration; (that Agni), the grandson of the waters, who, (present) in due season, the friend and ministering priest (of the sacrificer), sits upon the altar with (many) good things.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The grandson of the waters: apām **napāt**; vegetable substances are the progeny of rain, and fire is the progeny of vegetable substances, timber, or fuel; upon the altar: pṛthivyām = lit. on the earth, on the mount of earth constituting the altar
