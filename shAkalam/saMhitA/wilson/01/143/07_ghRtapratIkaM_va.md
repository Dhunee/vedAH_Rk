## English translation:

“The kindler (of the sacrificial fire) propitiates **Agni**, of glistening form; the upholder of your ceremony, like a friend; well kindled and well supplied (with fuel); blazing brightly at holy rites, he illumines our pure and pious observances.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Well kindled: **akraḥ** = from kram, to go= **akranta** or anukrānta, surpassed or exceeded by; **jvālā** samidādibhiḥ, flame, fuel and the like
