## English translation:

“His radiance is undecaying; the rays of him who is of plural asing aspect, are everywhere visible and bright; the intensely shining, all-pervading, unceasing, undecaying (rays) of **Agni**, desist not (from their functions).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Desist not: na rejante, do not tremble; they do not move, or are moved in burning, maturing; dāhapākādiṣu na calanti na cālyante vā anyaiḥ, or na may imply comparison, when bhātvakṣasasor na **sindhavaḥ** = like the rays of the sun
