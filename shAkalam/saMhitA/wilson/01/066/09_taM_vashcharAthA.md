## English translation:

“\[9-10\] Let us approach that blazing **Agni** with animal and vegetable offerings, as cows hasten to their stalls. He has tossed about his flames (in every direction), like running streams of water; the rays comingle (with the radiance) visible in the sky.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Caratha and vasthaya are explained as animal and vegetable offerings; further elaboration: tat prabhāvaiḥ bṛdayādibhiḥ sādhyāhutiḥ, paśuprabhāva-hṛdayādisādhanāyāhutya, these are invocations prompted by minds purified by offerings of moveable things, that is, animals; or of immoveable things, as rice, and the like
