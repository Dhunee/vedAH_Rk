## English translation:

“\[7-8\] He terrifies (his adversaries) like an army sent (against an enemy), or like the bright-pointed shaft of an archer. **Agni**, as **Yama**, is all that is born; as Yama, all that will be born; he is the lover of maidens, the husband of wives.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Yamo ha jāto, yamo janitvam: yama is interpreted as: yacchati dadāti kāmān stotṛbhyaḥ, he who gives the desired object to the worshippers; so, Yama becomes a synonym of Agni: yam agnir ucyate; or, Agni becomes one of the twins (yama), by the simultaneous birth of **Indra** and Agni (according to **Yāska**);

**Jāta** = all existing beings;

Janitva = those that will exist; the terms imply dependence of all existence, past, present, or future, upon worship with fire; lover of maids: the essential part of the nuptial ceremony is completed when the maiden offers to fire; husband of wives: An allusion to a legend; **Soma** obtained a maiden and gave her to **gandharva**, **Viśvāvasu**; he transferred her to Agni, who gave her to a mortal husband and bestowed upon her wealth and offspring; the reference is to the wife as a chief participant in the oblations to fire
