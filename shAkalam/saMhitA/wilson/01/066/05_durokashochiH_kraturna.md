## English translation:

“\[5-6\] **Agni** of unattainable brightness, is like a vigilant sacrificer; he is an ornament to all (in the sacrificial chamber), like a woman in a dwelling; when he shines with wonderful lustre, he is like the white (sun) or like a golden chariot amongst men, resplendent in battle.”
