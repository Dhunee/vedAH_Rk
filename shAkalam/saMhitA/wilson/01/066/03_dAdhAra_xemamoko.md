## English translation:

“\[3-4\] Like a secure mansion, he proects property; he (nourishes people) like barley; he is the conqueror of (hostile)) men; he is like a ṛṣi, the praiser (of the gods), eminent amongst (devout) person ns; as a spirited horse (goes to battle), he repairs delighted to the hall of sacrifice; may be bestow upon us food.”
