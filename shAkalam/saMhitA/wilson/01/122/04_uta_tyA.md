## English translation:

“Whenever I, the son of Uśij, worship with my offerings (of food) those two (**Aśvins**) who eat and drink (of oblations and libations) at (the season) of the world-whitening (dawn); do you, Priests, glorify the grandson of the waters (**Agni**), and render (the divinities of the day and night) the mothers (as it were) of the man who repeats their praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trees and shrubs spring up from the moisture of the waters, and fire proceeds from timber;hence, Agni is the grandson of the waters; or son of the waters (**Manu**, IX. 321)
