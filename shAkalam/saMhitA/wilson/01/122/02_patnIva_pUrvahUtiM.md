## English translation:

“Animated by our diversified praise, hasten, Morning and Night, to attend to our first invocation, as a wife (to the first call of her husband); and may the--Dawn, beautiful with the lustre of the (rising) Sun, and robbing like the Sun (her) vast expanse with golden rays, (come to our early rite).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Starīḥ = what covers or expands, smoke; the Sun invested or clothed with light, or destructive of foes: śatrūṇām hiṃsakaḥ tejasāchanno vā **Ādityaḥ**
