## English translation:

“The mman who does you wrong, **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, who injures you in any way, who does not present you with oblations, contracts for himself sickness in his heart; but he who, performing worship, (celebrates it) with praises.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Akṣṇayā dhruk: cakreṇa, mārgeṇa druhyati, offends by a wheel, or a way; this is the equivalent of **anyathā** prakareṇa, in another manner; yakṣmam hṛdaye nidhatte:he plural ces or deposits consumption in the heart; but **yakṣma** = **vyādhi**, sickness in genitive ral; a reference, perhaps, to the sense of mortification experienced by those who neglect the gods on observing the blessings which recompense devotion.
