## English translation:

“May all the gods favour us with a person n decorated with golden earrings and jewel necklace; may the venerable (company of the deities) be propitiated by the praises issuing (from the mouth of the worshipper); may our offerings be acceptable to them, and (may they be plural ased) with both (our praises and offerings).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Arṇas** = rūpe, form; i.e., a son; may they be plural ased with both = may they reward us in both worlds; the text has only ubhayeṣu, in both
