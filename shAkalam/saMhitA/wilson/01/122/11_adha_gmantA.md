## English translation:

“Royal bestowers of delight, listen to the invocation of (your) undying worshipper, and then come hither, that you who traverse the sky may be propitiated by the greatness of the (sacrificial) wealth presented to you by the sacrificer, who acknowledges no other protector.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Amṛtasya nahuṣo havam sureḥ = āhavānam amarṇasya stotrādiprerakasya manuṣyasya mama, the invocation of me, a mortal, instrumental gating praises and the like, not dying. Alternative rendering: the invocation of the immortal (deity) by me, a mortal worshipper
