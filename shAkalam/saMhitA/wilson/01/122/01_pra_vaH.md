## English translation:

“Present, mild-tempered (priests), the sacrificial viands which you have prepared, to there warm-showering **Rudra**. I praise him who, with his heroid (followers) as (with shafts) from a quiver, expelled (the **asuras**) from heaven; and (I praise) the **Maruts**, (who abide) between heaven and earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mild-tempered: **raghu**-manyavaḥ,of light or little anger; from raghu = **laghu**, light and **manyu** = anger. The second **pāda**: lit. 'I have praised of the expeller from heaven with arrows as if from a quiver the Maruts of heaven and earth'
