## English translation:

“A thousand mortals worshipped him together, twenty have hymned (his praise); a hundred (sages) repeatedly glorify him; so, **Indra**, is the oblation lifted up, manifesting your own sovereignty.”

Twenty: 16 priests employed at a sacrifice, **yajamāna**, his wife and two functionaries, **sadasya** and śamitrī, directors of the ceremonies of the assembly
