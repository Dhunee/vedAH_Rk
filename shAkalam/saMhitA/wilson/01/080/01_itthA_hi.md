## English translation:

“Mighty wielder of the thunderbolt, when the priest had thus exalted you (by praise), and exhilarating **Soma** (had been drunk), you did expel, by your vigour, Ahi from the earth, manifesting your own soverignty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Brahmā** = **brāhmaṇa**; this **sūka** is arcannanu svarājyam: arcannanu is interpreted as prakaṭayan: svsya svāmitvam prakaṭayan, making manifest his own mastership or supremacy
