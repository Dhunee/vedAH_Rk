“That exceedingly exhilarating **Soma**, which was brought by the hawk (from heaven), when poured forth, has exhilarated you, so that in your vigour, thunderer, you have struck **Vṛtra** from the sky, manifesting your own sovereignty.”

Brought by the hawk: śyenabhṛta, brought from heaven by **gāyatrī**, having the wings of a hawk
