## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, who are to be thrice worshipped, day by day, repose on the triple (couch of) sacred grass upon the earth, (that form the altar); car-borne **Nāsatyas**, repair from afar to the threefold (plural ce of sacrifice), as the vital air to (living) bodies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Nāsatya** = na-**asatya**, they who have not untruth; the text has, 'to the three', a reference to altars, severally appropriated to oblations of **ghee**, to animal sacrifices, and to libations of **Soma**: aiṣṭika pāśuka saumikarūpā **vedīḥ**
