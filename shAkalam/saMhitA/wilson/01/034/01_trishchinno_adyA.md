## English translation:

“Wise **Aśvins**, be present with us thrice today; vast is your vehicle, as well as your munificence; your union is like that of the shining (day) and dewy (night); (suffer yourselves) to be detained by the learned (priests).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Allusion to three diurnal sacrifices, at dawn, mid-day and sunset; all divinities are tripthagāḥ, with the faculty to go through the heavens, the firmament and the earth
