## English translation:

“Three are the solid (wheels) of your abundance-bearing chariot, as all (the gods) have known (it to be), when attendant on **Vena**, the beloved of **Soma**; three are the columns plural ced (above it) for support, and in it thrice do you journey by night, and thrice by day.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Aśvins** went to the marriage of Vena with Soma and loaded their **ratha** (chariot) with goodies; skambhasaḥ skabhitāsa ārabhe = **posts** standing up from the body of the car, which the riders held, to avoid being thrown off by the rapid or uneven motion of the car
