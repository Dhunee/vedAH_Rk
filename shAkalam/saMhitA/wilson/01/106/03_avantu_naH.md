## English translation:

“May the Pitrṣ, who are easily to be praised protect us; and may the two divinities, heaven and earth, the promoters of sacrifices, and of whom, the gods are progeny, protect us; and may they, who are bountiful and givers of dwellings, extricate us from sin, as a chariot from a defile.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Pitṛs** = **agniṣvāttas** and others (**Manu**, III.195)
