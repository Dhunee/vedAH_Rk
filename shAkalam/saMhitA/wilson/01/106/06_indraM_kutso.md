## English translation:

“**Kutsa**, the ṛṣi, thrown into a well, has invoked to his succour, **Indra**, the slayer of enemies, the encourager of good works; may they, who are bountiful and the givers of dwellings, extricate us from all sin, as a chariot from a defile.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kutsa = **Trita**; '**saci-pati** = husband of '**saci**;

**Śaci** = **karma**, act or rite
