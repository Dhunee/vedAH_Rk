## English translation:

“You two, **Agni** and **Soma**, acting together, have sustained these constallations in the sky; you have liberated the rivers that had been defiled from the notorious imputation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend: the imputation or brahmanicide refers to **Indra**'s killing of **Vṛtra**; the guilt is transferred to rivers, women and trees. Another legend: the rivers were defiled by the dead body of Vṛtra, which had fallen into them; the waters became unfit to bear any part in sacred rites, until they were purified by Agni and Soma, i.e. by oblations to fire and libations of Soma
