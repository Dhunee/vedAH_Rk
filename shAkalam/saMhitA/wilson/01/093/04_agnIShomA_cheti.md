## English translation:

“**Agni** and **Soma**, that prowess of yours, by which you have carried off the cows that were the food of **Paṇi**, is (well) known to us; you have slain the offspring of Bṛsya and you have obtained the luminary (the sun), for the benefit of the many.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bṛsayasya **śeṣa** = **Bṛsaya**'s **āpatya**, offspring (**Nirukta**, 3.2);

Bṛsaya = **Tvaṣṭā**, an **asura**. The offspring of Tvaṣṭā is **Vṛtra**. The agency of Agni and Soma in his death is explained by identifying them with the two vital airs, **prāṇa** and ap_na, the separation of which from Vṛtra was the possible cause of his death (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.5.2.4). By the destruction of Vṛtra, the enveloping cloud or gathered darkness, the sun was enabled to appear in the sky
