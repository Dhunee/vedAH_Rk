## English translation:

“**Agni** and **Soma**, the wind brought one of you from heaven, a hawk carried off the other by force from the summit of the mountain; growing vast by praise, you have made the world wide for (the performance of) sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend: **Vāyu** brought Agni from heaven as desired by **Bhṛgu**, when performing a sacrifice. Soma was brought from **svarga**, on the summit of **Mount Meru**, by **Gāyatrī**, in the shape of a hawk. The allusion is to the early use of fire and Soma in ceremonies
