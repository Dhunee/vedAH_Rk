## English translation:

“Powerful divinities, most acceptable to you both is that spot, (where you are worshipped); accepters of sacrifice, proclaim the great ceremony (as duly performed); for you two connect the efficacious and comprehensive rise with the vast heaven, like a cow with a burden.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You two connect: divo bṛhato dakṣam ābhuvam gām na dhuri upayuñjāthe **apas**, you two join the work (apas) able (to support the burden) of heaven, and applying to all creatures, as a cow to a load; the allusion is to the adequacy of worship or sacrifice to effect its objects, or realize its rewards, as the cow is able to bear a burden suited to her bodily strength: dhurīśārīrabalasya nirvāhe tad **artham** gām na dhenum iva; or, the allusion may be to her ability to give milk and the rest, kṣīrādikam iva
