## English translation:

“Accepter of sacrifices, you are the first whom (worshippers) propitiate with offerings, the produce of the cow; like (the application) of the mind (in the first instrumental nce) to the results (of the senses); hymns (prompted) by thoughts wholly intent upon you, celebrate (your praise); do you, with humble minds, bestow upon us wealth.”
