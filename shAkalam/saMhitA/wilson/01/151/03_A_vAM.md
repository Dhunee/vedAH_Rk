## English translation:

“For the sake (of obtaining) great vigour, showerers (of benefits), men glorify your birth from heaven and earth, which is to be extolled, inasmuch as you bestow (his desires) upon the worshipper (as the reward) of his sacrifice, and accept the rite (that is solemnized) with praise and oblation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Your birth from heaven and earth: vām **janma** rodasyoḥ = yuvayoḥ **sambandhi** janma jananam utpattim, dyāvapṛthivyoḥ sakaśāt, the birth connected with you two from heaven and earth
