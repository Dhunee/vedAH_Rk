## English translation:

“You distribute food, accompanied by riches; you bestow upon us, leaders (of sacrifice), wealth, ample, and defended by your wise provisions; the days with the nights have not attained your divinity; neither have the rivers, nor have the **asuras**, and they have not obtained (your) wealth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The days with the nights: dyāvo ahabhir na: **dyāvāḥ** = days;

**Ahan** = night; have not attained your divinity: nānaśurmagham: ānaśuḥ prāpnuvanti na vām dyāvo, i.e, there is no one in the **three worlds** more powerful than **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**: lokatraye yuvayoḥ parābhavitāro na ke api **santi**
