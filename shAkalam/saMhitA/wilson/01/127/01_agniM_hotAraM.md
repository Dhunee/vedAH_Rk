## English translation:

“I venerate **Agni**, the invoker (of the gods), the munificent, the giver of dwellings, the son of strength; he who knows all that exists, like a sage who is endowed with knowledge; who, the divine regenerator of sacrifices, through his lofty and reverntial devotion, covets for the gods the blaze of the liquefied butter which is offered in oblation with his flames.”
