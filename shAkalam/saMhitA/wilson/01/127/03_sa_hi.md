## English translation:

“Verily, that **Agni**, far shining with brilliant vigour, is the destroyer of foes, like a hatchet that cuts down trees; whatever is most solid and stable dissolves like water at his contact; unsparing, he sports (amidst enemies), nor desists (from their destruction), like an archer who retreats not (frombattle).”
