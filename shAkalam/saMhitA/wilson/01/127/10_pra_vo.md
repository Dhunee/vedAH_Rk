## English translation:

“May your praise, (oḥ priests), become grateful to **Agni**, who is desrving of laudation, who is of strength to overcome the strong, who is awakened at the dawn; to Agni, as if to a giver of cattle. Inasmuch as the presenter of the oblation repairs assiduously to every altar, the invoking priest, well-skilled in (pious) praise, glorifies him (Agni) as the first of the attaining (divinities), as a herald (recites the praises) of illustrious (men).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The last **pāda**: lit. 'in front, a herald, like praisers of the illustrious (ṛṣūṇām)
