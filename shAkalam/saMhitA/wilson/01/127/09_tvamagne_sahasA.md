## English translation:

“You, **Agni**, the destroyer (of enemies) by your strength, the possessor of great splendour, as born for the sake of sacrificing to the gods, as riches (are genitive rated) for the sake of sacrificing to the gods; verily your exhilaration is most brilliant, your worship is most productive of renown; hence, undecaying Agni, (sacrificers) wait upon you, like envoys (upon a prince; upon you), who preserve (your votaries) from decay.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ajara** = undecaying, not causing decay; or, one who does not praise others; one to whom along praise is due
