## English translation:

“He roars aloud, like the roaring of the winds, amidst the sanctified and selected (rites of sacred) solemnities; he who is to be worshipped, who is to be adored (for victory) over hosts (of enemies); he, the receiver 9of oblations), the manifester of the sacrifice; he, who is deserving of veneration, devours the oblations; hence, all men for their good pursue the path of **Agni**, who gives plural asure (to his worshipper), being plural ased (himself), in like manner as men follow a path (that leads) to happiness.”
