## English translation:

“We plural ce near the altar the (sacrificial) food of him who is more conspicuous by night than by day; (we offer it) to him who is scarcely alive by day; hence his (sacrificial) food finds prompt acceptance, like dwelling (given by a father) to a son; these undecaying fires, (although) discriminating between the devout and the undevout, grant (both) protection, and accepting (the offerings of the pious), they are exempt from decay.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aprāyuṣe divātarāt (**Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** 1.14), to him who has not prominent or vigorous life through the day, being dimmed or enfeebled by the superior effulgence of the sun
