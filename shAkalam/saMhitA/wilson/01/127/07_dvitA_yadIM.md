## English translation:

“The descendants of **Bhṛgu**, celebrating him (**Agni**) in both his forms, glorifying him, and payig him homage, proclaim his praises; the descendants of Bhṛgu, rubbing (the flame) for the oblation. For the radiant Agni, who is the guardian of all these treasures, has power (to distribute them). Mayhe, the receier of sacrifices, partake of the agreeable (offerings) given to satiety; may he, the receiver of sacrifices, partake (of the oblations).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Dvitā** yad im krīstāsaḥ, celebrating him as twofold; i.e. either as recognized in both the **Śruti** and **Smṛti**, the books of religion and law; or, as the giver of happiness in both this world and the next; or, as manifold in the Āhavanīha and other fires, 'two' connoting multiple or many
