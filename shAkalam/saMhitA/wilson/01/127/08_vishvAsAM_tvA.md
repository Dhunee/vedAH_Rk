## English translation:

“We invoke you, the protector of all people, the same alike to all, the preserver of the house, to enjoy (the oblation); you, who are the wafter of our infallible prayer, to enjoy (the oblation); we invoke you, who are the guest of men, to whom all these immortals apply for their sustenance, as (a son) to a father; you, to whom the priests offer oblations amongst the gods.”
