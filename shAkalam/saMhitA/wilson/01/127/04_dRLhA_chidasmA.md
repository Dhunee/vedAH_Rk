## English translation:

“They have presented substantial donations to him, as (they give riches) to a sage, and by resplendent means he grants us (grace) for our preservation; (the worshipper) presents (gifts) to **Agni** for preservation; he who pervades the (many offerings made to him) consumes them (as rapidly) as (he consumes) forests; he matures the standing corn by his potency; he destroys whatever (things) are stationary by his potency.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He destroys whatever: sthirāṇi ni riṇātiajasā: sthirāṇi = pāpāni, sins (amitrāṇi, enemies)
