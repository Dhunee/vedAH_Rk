## English translation:

“**Agni**, do youur becoming visible close to us, and partaking with benignant intent of (the sacrificial) food along with the gods, bestow upon us abundant riches, with benignant intent. Most mighty Agni, render us illustrious, that we may behold and enjoy (this earth); and grant greatness with excellent progeny to those who praise you, possessor of wealth, destroyer of foes, like a fierce (giant) in strength.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ugra** na **savasa**: kaścin **krūra**, some one cruel or fierce
