## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, **Agastya**, eminent among the leader of men, arouses you daily with numerous (invocations) like an instrumental ument of sound, for the sake of obtaining a manifold (flow) of a torrent (of rain).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like an instrumental ument of sound: kāradhunīva = from **kārā**, sound, **śabda**;

**Dhuni** = genitive rating, utpādayitā such as the conch-shell and the like, śaṅkhādi sa iva
