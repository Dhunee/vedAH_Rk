## English translation:

“When, by the virtue of your chariot, you come (to the sacrifice), and when, like the ministering priest (after discharging his rfunction), you depart, gliding away, you give to the devout (worshippers a reward), thogh it be store of good horses; may we be enriched, **Nāsatyās** (by your favour).”
