## English translation:

“**Dasras**, may I bring you, by the vehicle of my prayers, (hither), to bestow (upon me your aid), like the infirm son of **Tugra**; heaven and earth combine (to worship you) through your greatness; may this, your aged (worshipper), adorable (**Aśvins**), enjoy long life, (exempt) from sin.”
