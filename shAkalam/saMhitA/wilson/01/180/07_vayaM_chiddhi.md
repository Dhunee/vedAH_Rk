## English translation:

“Your sincere adorers, we verily praise you in various ways. The pitcher has been plural ced (ready for the **Soma**). Irreproachable **Aśvins**, showerers (of benefits) drink freely of the juice in the presence of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The pitcher has been plural ced: vipaṇir-hitāvān: **paṇi** = **droṇa** **kalaśa**, the jar or vessel into which the Soma, after expression, is strained through a filter; paṇi may also mean a merchant or trader;

Hitāvān = being plural ced or opulent;

Vi = viyujyatām, let him be separated; the imlication is: let the niggardly rich man who does not offer worship be cast off; another reading is: āhaviḥ paṇi = a niggard, offering no oblation
