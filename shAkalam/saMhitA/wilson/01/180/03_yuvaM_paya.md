## English translation:

“Youhave restored milk to the cow; you have (brought) down the prior mature (secretion) into the unripe (or barren udder) of the cow; the devout offerer of the oblation worships you, whose forms are truth, (as vigilant in the midst of the ceremony), as a thief (in the midst) of a thicket.”
