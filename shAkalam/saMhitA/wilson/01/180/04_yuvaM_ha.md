## English translation:

“You rendered the heat as soothing as sweet butter to **Atri**; wishing (for relief), and invested it with coolness,like water; therefore, for you, **Aśvins**, leaders (of rites) the fire-offering (is made); to you the **Soma** (drips) run like chariot wheels (down a declivity).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The fire-offering is made: tad vam paśva **iṣṭī** **paśu** = fire; agrees with the text agnir paśur-āsīt, **agni** was the victim; the implication is that the oblations are presented through fire to the Aśvins
