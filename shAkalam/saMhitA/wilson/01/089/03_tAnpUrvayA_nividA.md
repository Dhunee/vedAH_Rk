## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Pūrvoyā nividā: nivid = vāk, speech, or a text. Bhaga and Mitra are **Ādityas** (Mitra is the lord of the day: maitram vā **ahar** (**Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa**); Dakṣa is a **Prajāpati**, able to make the world (he is also the creator, **Hiraṇyagarbha**, diffused among breathing or living creatures as breath or life; prāṇo vai **dakṣaḥ**, dakṣa is verily breath (Taittirīya **Saṃhitā**: 2.5.2.4);

Asrid = from sridh, to dry up; hence, undrying, unchanging (i.e. the class of **Maruts**);

Aryaman = the sun (asau vā **āditya** **aryama**, he, the sun, is Aryaman (Taittirīya Saṃhitā 2.3.4.1);

Varuṇa = from vṛ, to surround, encompassing the wicked with his bond; he is also the lord of the night: **vāruṇi** **rātrī** (Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa 1.7.10.1); Soma is two-fold, the product of the earth and the moon, as a divinity in heaven. The Aśvins are so termed either from having horses (aśvavantau), or from pervading all things, the one with moisture, the other with light; they are heaven and earth, they are day and night, the sun and the moon; **aitihāsika**, traditionists; they were two virtuous princes (**Nirukta**, 12,1)
