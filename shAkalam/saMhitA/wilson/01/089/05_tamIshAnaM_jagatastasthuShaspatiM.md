## English translation:

“We invoke that lord of living beings, that protector of things immoveable, **Indra**, who is to be propitiated by pious rites, for our protection; as **Pūṣan** has ever been our defender for the increase of our riches, so may he (continue) the unmolested guardian of our welfare.”
