## English translation:

“Since a hundred years were appointed (for the life of man), interpose not, gods, in the midst of our passing existence, by inflicting infirmity in our bodies so that our sons become our sires (i.e. let us not become so feeble and firm as to be, infants and to require the paternal care of our own sons\].”
