## English translation:

“May the wind waft to us the grateful medicament; may mother earth, may father heaven, (convey) it (to us); may the stones that express **Soma**, and are productive of plural asure (bring) it (to us); **Aśvins**, who are to be meditated upon, hear (our submission).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bheṣajam: aśvins, the physicians of the gods bestow the medicament
