## English translation:

“May **Indra**, who listens to much praise, guard our welfare; may **Pūṣan**, who knows all things, guard our welfare; may **Tārkṣya**, with unblemished weapons, guard our welfare.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tārkṣya, son of Tṛkṣa is **Garuḍa**. He is **Ariṣṭanemi**, he who has unharmed or irresistible (aṛṣṭa) weapons (**nemi**, circumerference of a wheel). Ariṣṭanemi is a **Prajāpati** (**Vāyu Purāṇa**). Tārkṣya = **Aruṇa**, the person nified dawn
