## English translation:

“The **Maruts** who are going forth decorate themselves like feminine les; they are gliders (through the air), the sons of **Rudra**, and doers of good works by which they promote the welfare of earth and heaven; heroes, who grind (solid rocks), they delight in sacrifices.”
