## English translation:

“Confiding in their own strength, they have increased in (power); they have attained heaven by their greatness, and have made (for themselves) a spacious abode; may they, for whom **Viṣṇu** defends (the sacrifice) that bestows all desires and confers delight, come (quickly), like birds, and sit down upon the plural asant and sacred grass.”
