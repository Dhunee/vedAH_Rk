## English translation:

“Whatever blessings (are diffused) through the **three worlds**, and are in your gift, do you bestow upon the donor (of the oblation), who addressed you with praise; bestow them, also, **Maruts**, upon us, and grant us, bestowers of all good, riches, whence springs prosperity.”
