## English translation:

“The gods formerly made you, **Agni**, the living genitive ral of the mortal **Nahuṣa**; they made Iḷā, the instrumental uctress of **Manu**, when the son of my father was born.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nahuṣa was the son of **Āyus**, son of **Purūravas**, who was elevated to heaven as an **Indra**. Iḷā instrumental tues the first rules of performing sacrifices, hence she is Śāsanī = dharmopadeśakartrī, the giver of instrumental uction in duty
