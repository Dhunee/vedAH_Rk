## English translation:

“**Agni**, pre-eminent over the wind, become manifest to the worshipper, in approbation of his worship. Heaven and earth tremble (at your power); you have sustained the burden in the rite for which the priest was appointed; your, **Vasu**, has worshipped the venerable (gods).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Prathamo mātariśvane, first in, or on the wind; alluding to the text, agnirvāyurādityaḥ: fire, air, sun in which Agni precedes **Vāyu**
