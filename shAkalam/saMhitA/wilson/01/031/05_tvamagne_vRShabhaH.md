## English translation:

“Your, **Agni**, are the showerer (of desires), the augmenter of the prosperity (of your worshipper); you are to be called upon as the ladle is lifted up; upon him who fully understands the invocation and makes the oblation, you, the provider of sustenance, first bestow light, and then upon all men.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who fully understands the invocation: he who knows the **āhuti**, with the vaṣat **kṛti** or uttering the word vaṣat at the moment of pouring the butter on the fire
