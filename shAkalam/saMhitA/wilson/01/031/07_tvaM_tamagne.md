## English translation:

“You sustain, **Agni**, that mortal (who worships you), in the best immortality by daily food; you bestow on the sage, who is desirous (of creatures) of both kinds of birth, happiness and sustenance.”

Both kinds of birth: dvipadām catuṣpadām lābhāya, to acquire bipeds and quadrupeds
