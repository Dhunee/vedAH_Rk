## English translation:

“**Agni**, you dend the man who gives presents (to the priests) on every side, like well-stitched armour. The man who keeps choice viands in his dwelling, and with them entertains (his guests), performs the sacrifice of life, and is the likeness of heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Varma** syūtam = sewn armour, formed with needles without leaving a fissure; jīvam-yājam yajate, sacrifices a life-sacrifice: jīvayajanasahitam yajñam, a sacrifice with sacrifice of life; jīvaniśpādyam, that by which life is to be supported;

Jīvayājam = **jīvaḥ**, living, priests, who ijyante dakṣinābhiḥ, are worshipped by gifts
