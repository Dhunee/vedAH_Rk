## English translation:

“The (married) couples; anxious to satisfy you, and presenting (oblations) together, celebrate (your worship), for the sake of (obtaining) herds of catle; presenting (you), **Indra** (oblations); you well know that these two person ns are desirous of cattle, are desirous of heaven, and (ou abide), displaying your thunderbolt, the showerer (of benefits), your constant companion, ever, Indra, associated (with you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mithunāḥ = the pairs; couples consisting of husband and wife. The **Mīmāṃsā** is cited to show that the wife may be associated with her husband in oblations to fire: jāyāpatī agnim ādadhīyātām, let wife and husband plural ce the fire; adhyayanābhāve api vedam patnyai pradāya vācayet: since there is no regular reading (of the **Veda**) he (the husband), having imparted the Veda to his wife may cause her to recite it (Āśvilāyana Śrautasūtra 1.11); she joins in the **mantra**: suprajasas tvā vayam: we, having good progeny, praise you (**Taittirīya** Samhitā 1.1.10.1).
