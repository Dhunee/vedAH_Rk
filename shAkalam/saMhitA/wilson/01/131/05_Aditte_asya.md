## English translation:

“Thenceforth have your worshippers scattered (libations) for the augmentation of your vigour; that in your exhilaration, showerer, (of benefits), you may defend those who are solicitous (of your favour); that you may defend those who are desirous of (your) friendship; for them you have uttered a shout to encourage them in combats; from you they obtain many and many an enjoyment; anxious for food, they obtain it (from you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uttered a shout: cakartha kāram;

**Kāra** = **śabda**, sound; **siṃhanāda**-lak.ṣaṇam = war-cry; i.e. you have done a deed, i.e., performed a service
