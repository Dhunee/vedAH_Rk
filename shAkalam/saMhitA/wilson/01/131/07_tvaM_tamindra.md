## English translation:

“**Indra**, endowed with many (excellences), do you, who are exalted (by our praises), and are well disposed towards us, (slay) the man who is unfriendly to us; (slay) swuch a man, hero, with your thunderbolt; kill him who sins against us; ever most prompt to hear, hear (us); let every ill-intent (towards us, such as alarms) a wearied (traveller) on the road, be counteracted; let every ill-intent be counteracted.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛṣṭam na yāman = like one wearied on the road; towards whom evil designs may be entertained by robbers, durmatiścaurādiviṣayā
