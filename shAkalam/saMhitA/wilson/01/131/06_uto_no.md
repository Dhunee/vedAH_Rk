## English translation:

“Will (**Indra**) be present at this our morning rite; be appraised, (Indra), of the oblation offered with (due) observances; offered with (due) observances for the sake of (obtaining) heaven; and since, wielder of the thunderbolt, showerer (of benefits), you know how to destroy the malevolent, do you, therefore, listen to the acceptable (praise) of me, intelligent, though a novice; (hear it from me) a novice.”
