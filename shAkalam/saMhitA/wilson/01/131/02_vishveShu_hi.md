## English translation:

“Hoping to partake of your bounties, (your worshippers) hasten severally in every rite to (adore) you, who ask one and all; each severally seeking heaven. We meditate on you, the sustainer of our strength, like a boat that bears (passengers) across (a stream); mortals, indeed, knowing **Indra**, propitiate him with sacrifices; mortals (propitiate him) with hymns.”
