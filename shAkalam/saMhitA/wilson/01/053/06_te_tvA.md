## English translation:

“Those who were your allies, (the **Maruts**), brought you joy; protector of the pious, those libations and oblations (that were offered you on slaying **Vṛtra**), yielded you delight, when you, unimpeded by foes, did destroy the ten thousand obstacles oposed to him who praised you and offered you oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Daśa** sahaśrāṇi vṛtrāṇi = covers, concealments, obstructions, avarakāni
