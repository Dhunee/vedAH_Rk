## English translation:

“Your easy-rolling car alights upon the earth, where favourable to the sacred rite, you stop for the sake of the (sacrificial) food; may this hymn, promotive of your person nal (welfare), be associated with your forms, and do you unite with the dawn, the daughter of heaven.”
