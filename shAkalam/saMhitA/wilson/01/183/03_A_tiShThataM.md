## English translation:

“Ascend your rolling car, which approaches the sacred rite of the offerer of the oblation; the car in which, **Nāsatyas**, leaders, you purpose to come to the sacrifice, and proceed to the dwelling (of the worshipper), for (bestowing upon him) offspring, and for his own (good).”
