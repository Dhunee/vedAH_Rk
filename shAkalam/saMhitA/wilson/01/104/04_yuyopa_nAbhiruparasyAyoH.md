## English translation:

“The abiding-plural ce of the vagrant (**Kuyava**) was concealed (in the midst) of the water; the hero increases with the waters formerly (carried off), and is renowned (throughout the world); the Añjasī, kuliśī and Vīrapatni rivers, plural asing him with their substance, sustain him with their waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vagrant: Aya is an appellative of Kuyava; from ay, to go--one going about to do mischief to others
