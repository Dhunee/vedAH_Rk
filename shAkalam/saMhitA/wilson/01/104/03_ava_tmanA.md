## English translation:

“(The **Asura**), knowing the wealth of others, carries it off of himself; present in the water, he carries off, of himself, the foam; the two wives of **Kuyava** bathe with the water; may they be drowned in the depths of the **Śiphā** river.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

(The Asura): named Kuyava
