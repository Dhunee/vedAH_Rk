## English translation:

“The altar has been raised, **Indra**, for your seat; hasten to sit upon it as a neighing horse (hastens to his stable); slackening the reins, and letting your coursers free, who, at the season of sacrifice, bear you night and day.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Added: yāgakāle prāpte = the time of sacrifice having arrived; the text has only, 'for the season of sacrifice';

Prapitve = prāpte = lit. arrived, or adversb signifying proximity: near, nigh, at **hand** (**Nirukta** 3.20)
