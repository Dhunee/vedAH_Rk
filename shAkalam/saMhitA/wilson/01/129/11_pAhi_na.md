## English translation:

“Deservedly-lauded **Indra**, preserve us from suffering; for you are always verily the chastiser of the malevolent; your, being divine, (are the chastiser) of the malevolent; (you are) the slayer of the wicked **rakṣas**, the preserver of a pious (worshipper), such as I am; for asylum (of all men), the progenitor has begotten (for this purpose); has begotten you, asylum (of all men), the destroyer of the **rākṣasas**.”
