## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, (sustain us) with wealth that transports (man beyond calamity); for, (enhanced) greatness accrues to you, however mighty, (from our thanks) for (your) protection, as it does to **Mitra** for his powerful protection, most potent and immortal (Indra), our defender and preserver, (ascend) some chariot, (and come hither); devourer (of foes), repel any one assailing us; any one assailing us, devourer (of foes).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tvā **mahimā** sakṣad avase mahe mitram na avase = lit. greatness is present to you for protection as to mitra for great protection; or, mitra may be rendered 'friend', as praises animate a friend with great attachment, tam sakhyam yathā mahatyai prītaye saṃbhajante. Adrivs, voc. of adrivat = wielder of the thunderbolt (**adri**); but, ad = eat; i.e. adrivat = śatrūṇām atiśayena **bhakṣaka** = the eater in excess of enemies (**Nirukta** iv.4). iśaḥ parivṛtaḥ: allusion to the rains **shut** up in the clouds; and the second reference, to the seeds shut up in the earth germinating on the fall of the rain, and affording, in either case, 'food', iśaḥ
