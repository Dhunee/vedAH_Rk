## English translation:

“May I be competent to utter (praise) for the (**Soma**) libation, sustaining existence, which, like the (deity) to be invoked, (**Indra**), goes abounding with food to (each) venerable (rite); the destroyer (of **rākṣasas**) at (each) venerable (rite). May that (libation) of itself repress with chastisement the malevolence of him who reviles us; let the thief fall downwards (and perish), like a little (water) running down (a declivity).”
