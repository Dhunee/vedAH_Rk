## English translation:

“Hear our invocation, **Indra**; you who in various battles (associated) with the **Maruts**, are animated through their encouragement; (and are able), with the Maruts, to destroy (your foes); (for you are) he, who, (aided) by heroes, are of yourself the giver (of victory); or, (when praised) by the pious, the giver of food, and whom the lords (of prayer) celebrate as swift-moving and eager (for sacrificial food), like a fleet courser (eager for forage).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nṛbhiḥ = maruts; or, by men, i.e. by the worshippers
