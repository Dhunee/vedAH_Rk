## English translation:

“Do you, **Indra**, come to us with abundant riches by a path free from evil; (by a path) unobstructed by **rākṣasas**; be with us when afar; be with us when nigh; favour us, whether afar or nigh, with the objects of our desires; ever favour us with the objects of our desires.”
