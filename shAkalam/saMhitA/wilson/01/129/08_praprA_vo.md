## English translation:

“**Indra** is powerful in discomfiture of the malevolent by his self-glorifying aids, (granted) unto you and unto us; (he is) the tearer o fthe malevolent (to pieces); the impetuous ogre that was sent against us by devouring (foes) to destroy us, has been itself destroyed; it will not reach us; it will not do us harm.”
