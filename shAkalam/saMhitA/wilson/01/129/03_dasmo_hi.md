## English translation:

“You, the subduer (of adversaries), pierce every rain (confining) skin; you overtake, hero, every flying mortal (cloud), and abandon (it) when exhausted (of its water) for such glorious deed, **Indra**, I offer praise to you; to heaven; to the self-glorifying **Rudra**; to **Mitra**; (to each) the benefactor (of mankind) for such glorious (deed).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
