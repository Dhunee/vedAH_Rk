## English translation:

“We desire, (priests), **Indra** to be present at your sacrifice, (he who is) our friend, the frequenter of all (ceremonies), the endurer (of enemies), the ally (of his worshippers), the patient expecter of (sacrificial) viands, associated (with the **Maruts**); do you, Indra, guard our holy rite for our preservation, for in whatsoever contests (you may engage), no enemy whom you oppose, prevails against you; you prevail over every enemy whom (you oppose).”
