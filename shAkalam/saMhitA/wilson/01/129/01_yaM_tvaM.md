## English translation:

“**Indra**, frequenter of sacrifices, quickly enable him to attain his desires, to whom you repair in your car to receive the oblation; and for whom, as he is mature (in understanding) and devout, you who are without fault, entertain regard. Accept his offering, for you who are without fault, are prompt to favour us (among) the pious (offerrs of oblations) as (you accept) this our praise.”
