## English translation:

“**Indra**, the showever (of blessings), knows the object (of his worshipper), who has performed many acts of worship (with the **Soma** gathered) on the ridges of the mountain, and (therefore) comes with the troop (of **Maruts**).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Yat sānoḥ sānum āruhat, mounting from ridge to ridge: this is said of the **yajamāna**, who goes to the mountain to gather soma for bruising, or fuel for the fire, or other articles required for the ceremony
