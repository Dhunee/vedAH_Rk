## English translation:

“Appearing amongst them (the waters), the bright-shining (**Agni**) increases, rising above the flanks of the waving waters, spreading his own renown; both (heaven and earth) are alarmed, as the radiant Agni is born, and, approaching the lion, they pay him honour.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Above the flanks of the waving waters: jihmānām apām upasthe, above, on the side, or tip, of the crooked waters; reference to Agni as the lightning; approaching the lion: **siṃha** applied to Agni, implying sahanaśīlam, abhibhāvana śīlam, ability to suffer or be overcome
