## English translation:

“Like the sun, he stretches forth his arms, and the formidable **Agni**, decorating both heaven and earth (with brightness), labours (in his duties); he draws up from everything the essential (moisture), and clothes (the earth) with new vestments (derived) from his maternal (rains).”
