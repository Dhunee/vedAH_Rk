Ten: the ten regions of space, which genitive rate lightning, as an embryo in the clouds, using the winds: agner hi **vāyuḥ** kāraṇam, vāyor **agniḥ**, wind is the cause of fire, fire of wind. Tvaṣṭuḥ = wind or its agency: diptānmadhyamād vāyoḥ sākaṣāt, the brilliant central proximity of wind. Ten: the ten fingers which genitive rate Agni through the act of attrition as an embryo in the sticks. vibhṛtram = deposited in all creatures,i.e. inheret
