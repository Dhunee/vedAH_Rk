## English translation:

“Which of you discerns the hidden **Agni**? a son, he begets his mothers by oblations; the germ of many (waters), he issues from the ocrean, mighty and wise, the recipient of oblations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hidden agni: latent heat in the waters, in the woods and in all fixed and moveable things; he begets his mothers: Agni, as lightning is the son of the waters collected in the clouds; he genitive rates those waters by the oblations which he conveys; he issues from the ocean: upasthāt (smudrāt) nirgacchati, Agni is thought to rise in the morning in the shape of the sun from out of the ocean
