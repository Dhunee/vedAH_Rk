## English translation:

“Adorable **Agni**, you are sagacious, and in a short time discriminate between both those men (who do and do not worshhip you); approach the worshipper at the proper time, and be compliant (with his wishes); like an instrumental tutor of the rite, (who is directed) by the desires (of the priests).”
