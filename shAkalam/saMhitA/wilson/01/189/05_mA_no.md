## English translation:

“Abandon us not, **Agni**, to a wicked, voracious, malevolent foe; (abandon us) not to one who has fangs, and who bites; nor to one without teeth; nor to the malignant; nor give us up, powerful Agni, to disgrace.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

To one who has fangs and who bites: snakes and venomous reptiles; to one without teeth: and who, therefore, do mischief with other natural weapons, as horns and claws; nor to the malignant: rīṣate = to one who injures as thieves and **rākṣasas**
