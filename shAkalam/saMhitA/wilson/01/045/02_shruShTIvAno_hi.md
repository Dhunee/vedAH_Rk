## English translation:

“Verily the discriminating gods are givers of rewards to the offerer (of oblations); lord of red coursers, propitiated by our praises, bring hither the three and thirty divinities.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**, 2,18 refes to two classes of 33 divinities each; the first one are **Somapās** (drinkers of **Soma**); and the second are person nifications of sacrifices: 11 prayājas, 11 anuyājas, 11 **upayājas** (propitiated with oblations of clarified butter, not libations of Soma)
