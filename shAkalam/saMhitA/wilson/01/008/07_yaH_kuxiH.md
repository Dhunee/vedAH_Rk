## English translation:

“The belly of **Indra**, which quaffs the **Soma** juice abundantly, swells like the ocean, (and is ever) moist, like the ample fluids of the palate.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Urvīnāpo na **kākudaḥ**: **kākuda** = **kākud**, the pinnacle of a mountain; the rendering: 'like the abundant waters (or torrents) from the mountain-tops'
