## English translation:

“Verily his chanted and recited praises are to be desired and repeated to **Indra**, that he may drink the **Soma** juice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Stoma** = chanted praises: sāmasādhyam stotram, praise to be accomplished by the **Sāmaveda**;

**Uktha** = recited praises: ṛk-sādhyam śastram, the unsung praise to be accomplished by the ṛcā. śastram = a hymn not sung: śastram apragīta-mantrastotram. The repetition of the śastram is done by **hotā** (hotuḥ-**karma**); **suti** and stoma are sanitam stotram, sung or chanted hymn. Thus, **śastra** = hymn recited (audibly, or inaudibly);

Stoma = hymn sung
