## English translation:

“\[3-4\] The gods followed the traces of the fugitive; the search spread everywhere, and earth became like heaven; the waters swelled (to conceal him), who was much enlarged by praise, and was manifested as it were in the womb in the waters, the source of sacrificial food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

So nileyata, so āpaḥ praviṣat, tam **devaḥ** praiṣam aicchan; tam **matsyāḥ** prabravit: he, concealing himself, entered into the waters; the gods wished for a messenger to him; a fish discovered him. A fish revealed to the gods where **Agni** had hidden (**Taittiriya**)
