## English translation:

“\[1-2\] The firm and plural cid divinites followed you, **Agni**, by your footmarks, when hiding in the hollow (of the water), like a thief (who has stolen) an animal; you, claiming oblations, and bearing them to the gods; all the deities who are entitled to worship, sit down near to you.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

In **dvipadā** virāt **chanda**, each hymn is divided into half; every two **padas** are considered to form a complete hymṇ **guha** catantam = a cave, applied to the depth of the waters or to the hollow of the **aśvattha** tree; agni had hidden in both these caves for a season
