## English translation:

“\[7-8\] He is the kind kinsman of the waters, like a brother to his sister; he consumes the forest as a **rājā** (destroys) his enemies; when excited by the wind, he traverses the woods, and shears the hairs of the earth.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The fruit, flowers, grasses, shrubs and the like are called **roma** pṛthivyāḥ = hairs of the earth
