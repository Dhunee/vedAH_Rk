## English translation:

“\[9-10\] He breathes amidst the waters like a sitting swan; awakened at the dawn, he restores by his operations consciousness to men; he is a creator, like **Soma**; born from the waters (where he lurked) like an animal with coiled-up limbs, he became enlarged and his light (spread) afar.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Creator like Soma: soma na **vedhaḥ**; just as soma creates or causes 'plural nts' to grow, so **Agni** creates or extracts from them their nutritive faculty. etāvad vā idam **annam** annādaśca soma eva annam agnir **annādaḥ**: inasmuch as there is food and feeder, so soma is the food, and the feeder is agni (Vājasneyi **Yajuṣ**)
