## English translation:

“\[5-6\] **Agni** is grateful as nourishment, vast as the earth, productive (of vegetable food), as a mountain, delightful as water; he is like a horse urged to a charge in battle and like flowing waters; who can arrest him?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Puṣṭirna raṇvā = like grateful nourishment; kṣitirna **pṛthvī** = like the vast earth; the epithets applied to objects also apply to Agni
