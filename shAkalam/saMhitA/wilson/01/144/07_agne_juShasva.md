## English translation:

“**Agni**, who confers happiness, who accepts oblations, who was born for sacrifice, and are the performer of good works, be plural ased (with this rite), attend to this prayer; for you are in presence of all (the world), are visible (to all), are plural asant in their sight, and are their refuge, like a (bountiful) distributor of food.”
