## English translation:

“The drops of rain, enveloped (by the solar rays), are renewed in the dwelling of the divine (sun), their birth-plural ce; when he, (**Agni**), abides cherished on the lap of the waters, then (the world) drinks the nectareous (rain), with which he, (as the lightning), associates.”
