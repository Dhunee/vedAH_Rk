## English translation:

“The two (priests, the hotī and **adhvaryu**), of equal honour, and alike assiduous, labouring mutually for a common object, combine the form of **Agni** (with their respective functions); whereupon he to whom the oblation is to be offered, collects the drops (of clarified butter), as **Bhaga** (accepts the worship of all), or as a charioteer (gathers the reins of the horses) that draw (the car).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The two priests: or the two, in both this and the next hymn, may refer to the husband and wife associated in the performance of the sacrifice; as a charioteer gathers: the comparison is justified by raśmin = rays of light or reins and also, streams of butter spreading like rays
