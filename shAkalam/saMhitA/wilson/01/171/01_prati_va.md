## English translation:

“I approach you, **Maruts**, with this reverential homage, and with a hymn implore your favour against eager (foes); with minds pacified by our praises, suppress your anger, and let loose your horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

I.e. take the horses out of your car, that you may not come back to the sacrifice in anger
