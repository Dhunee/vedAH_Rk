## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, men who desire to glorify you with (their) hymns, cause, as it were, their praises to be heard, propitiating you with oblations; for, from you, who are possessed of all opulence, (they obtain) every kind of wealth and abundant food. **Dasras**, the fellies (of the wheels) of your honey-laden car drop honey, (carried) in your golden (car).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hiraṇyaye rathe dasrā hiraṇyaye: the epithet means 'golden'; the first occurrence is interpreted as madhupūrṇa = pruṣāyante pavayaḥ (pavī rathanemirbhavati yadvipunāti bhūmim--**Nirukta** 5.5), the circumferences of the wheels distil (kṣaranti sravanti), or scatter honey, as they revolve; in the second occurrence, hirṇyaye is explained as 'plural asing, heart-delighting', hṛdayaramaṇa; and to provide an assumed ellipse, by havir-vahatam, 'convey the oblation in your delightful chariot'
