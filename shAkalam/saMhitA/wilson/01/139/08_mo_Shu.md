## English translation:

“Never, **Maruts**, may your glorious energies be exerted against us; may our (riches) never diminish; never may our towns decay; and may whatever is wonderful, admirable immortal, or (whatever is recognized to be living), from its sound, that has been yours from age to age, (devolve) upon us; whatever is most difficult (of attainment) bestow upon us; whatever is most difficult (to be attained).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ghoṣāt = **ghoṣāḥ**, plural sounds, noises; and by metonymy, those who utter them, either cattle or people
