“**Dasras**, your purpose is known; you would repair to heaven; your charioteers harness (your steeds) for your heavenward journey; the horses that injure not (the car) on your journey to heaven. We have plural ced you, Dasras, in your golden three-shafted chariot, going by an (easy) road to heaven, humiliators (of enemies), and principal regulators of the rain.”
