## English translation:

“**Indra**, showerer (of blessings), these effused **Soma**, (expressed) by stones, and which have sprung (from mountain), are for your drinking; these libations have burst forth for you; may they satisfy you as an offering presented (in the hope of receiving) great and wonderful riches. Acceptor of laudations, come to us, glorified by our hymns; come to us well plural ased.”
