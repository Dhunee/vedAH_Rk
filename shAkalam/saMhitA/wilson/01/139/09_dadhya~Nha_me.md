## English translation:

“The ancient Dadhyañc, **Aṅgiras**, **Priyamedha**, **Kaṇva**, **Atri**, **Manu**, have known my birth; they who were of old and Manu have known (my progenitors); for of them is long life amongst the gods, and in them is our existence; for the sake of their nigh station, I adore (the gods) with praise; I worship **Indra** and **Agni** with praise.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

My birth: the birth of me, **Parucchepas**, the ṛṣi of the hymn; he is subsequent to them or of more recent date. te me pūrve **manur** viduḥ: added is pitrādīn, fathers;

Manu = **manavaḥ**, plural, i.e. former **Manus**; pūrve is applied to those previously named, Dadhyañc and the rest; manavaśca and the Manus. In them is our existence: asmākam teṣu nābhayaḥ, in them are our 'navels'; explained as vital airs, in connection with life, jīvena **saha** saṃbandhavantaḥ **prāṇāḥ**; or by sacrifices in relation to their rewards, phalena saṃbaddhāḥ yāgāḥ
