## English translation:

“Let the invoker (of the gods) offer sacrifice, and may they, desirous of the offering, (partake of) the acceptable (libation); **Bṛhaspati** himself, desiring (the libation), celebrates worship with libations; with copious and excellent libations. We catch from a distant quarter the sound of the stones, whereby the performer of pious acts has of himself secured the waters (of the clouds); the performer of pious acts (has secured) many habitations.”
