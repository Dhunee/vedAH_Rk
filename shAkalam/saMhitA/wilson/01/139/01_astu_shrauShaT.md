## English translation:

“May our prayers be heard, I plural ce before (me) **Agni** with reverence; we have recourse to his celestial might; we have recourse to **Indra** and to **Vāyu**; which doing, a new (hymn) has been addressed (by us) to the radiant navel (of the earth); and thereupon may our pious rites attain the gods; may our pious rites attain the presence of the gods.”
