## English translation:

“**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, bestow (upon us) abundantly that unenduring water which you obtain from the sun, through your own energy; through the inherent energy of the vigorous; may we thus behold your golden (forms) in our halls of sacrifice, (brought thither) by our sacred rites, and by our thoughts and senses (intent upon you); by our senses (intent upon offering) the **Soma**.”
