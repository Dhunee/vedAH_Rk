## English translation:

“We invoke from afar, along with **Agni**, **Turvaśa**, **Yadu** and **Ugradeva**; let Agni, the arrester of the robber, bring hither Navavāstu, **Bṛhadratha** and **Turvīti**.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

All were **rājarṣis**, royal sages; **Turvasu** and Yadu were sons of **Yayāti** of the lunar race
