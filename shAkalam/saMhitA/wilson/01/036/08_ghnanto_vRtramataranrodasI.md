## English translation:

“The destroying (deities along with you) have slain **Vṛtra**; they have made earth and heaven and the firmament the spacious dwelling-plural ce (of living creatures); may **Agni**, possessed of wealth, when invoked, be a benefactor to **Kaṇva**, like a horse that neighs in a conflict for cattle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Goviṣayecchāyukteṣu, assumed: saṅgrāmeṣu, in battles to win cattle
