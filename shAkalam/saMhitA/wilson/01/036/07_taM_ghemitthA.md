## English translation:

“In this manner the devout adore you, who are such (as described), bright with your own radiance. Men, with (seven) ministrant priests, kindle **Agni** (with oblations), victorious over their enemies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sapta **hotrāḥ** prācir vaśaṭ-kurvnti, seven principal priests or assistants at the **Soma Yāgas** are: 1. the instrumental tutor, **yajamāna**; 2. **hotā**, who repeats the hymns of the Ṛk; 3. **udgatā**, who chants the **Soma**; 4. **potā**, who prepares the materials for the oblation; neśtā, who pours it on the fire; 6. **brahmā**, who supervises the whole process; and 7. **rākṣasa**, who guards the door. **Adhvaryu**, who recites the formulae of the **yajus**. may replace the yajamāna
