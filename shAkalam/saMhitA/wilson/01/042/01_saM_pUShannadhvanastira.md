## English translation:

“Pūṣanm convey us over the road, remove the wicked (obsructer of the way). Son of the cloud, deity, go before us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**pūṣan** is one of the 12 **ādityas**. He presides over the earth: pṛthivyābhimānī **devaḥ**; he cherishes the world: from pus', to nourish. He presides over journeying or the roads
