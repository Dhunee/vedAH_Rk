## English translation:

“She goes to the west, as (a woman who has) no brother (repairs) to her **male** (relatives); and like one ascending the hall (of justice) for the recovery of property, (she mounts in the sky to claim her lustre); and like a wife desirous to plural ase her husband, Uṣā puts on becoming attire, and smiling as it were, displays her charms.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Abhrāteva puṃsa eti **pratīcī** = as a damsel who has no brother, averted from her own abiding plural ce (**garta** iti gṛhanāma, kṛdaro **gartaḥ** (**Nirukta** 3.4.3), goes to or relies upon her male relatives, puṃsaḥ, for support; or it may mean that she is in such case to offer the funeral cakes to her progenitors; pratīcī, with face averted, as applicable to Uṣā, means looking or going to the west; gartārug iva sanaye dhanānām, like one who ascends (āruḥ, to mount) a house (garta-**gṛha**) for the gift or receipt of riches;

Garta = stool or table on which dice are thrown; there is a practice in the south, in which a childless widow seeks to obtain support from her husband's relatives by repairing to a gambling-house; cf. Muller, Preface, 2nd vol. of the **Ṛgveda**,p. xvi
