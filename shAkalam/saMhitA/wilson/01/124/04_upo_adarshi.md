## English translation:

“She is beheld nigh at **hand**, (radiant) as the breast of the illuminator (the sun); and, like **Nodhas**, has made manifest many plural asing (objects); like a matron she awakens (her) sleeping (children), and of all (feminine les who are) stirring betimes, she, the most unvarying, repeatedly appears.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śundhyuvo na **vakṣas**: śundhyu = sun, the collective solar rays;

Śundhyu = a water-bird of white colour; the morning light is compared to its white plural mage;

Śundhyuvaḥ = plural waters (**Nirukta** 4.16); Nodhas, the ṛṣi, displays his wishes by his prayers and praises, so the dawn puts forth the light that is accessible to all the world;

Admasad: **adma**, food or a dwelling; sad, who abides; the mistress of the house, or one who has to cook the food of her family; she rises with the dawn and wakes up the sleepers of the household
