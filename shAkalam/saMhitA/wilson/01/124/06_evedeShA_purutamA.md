## English translation:

“Verily she, the wide-expanded Uṣā, neglects not (to give) the joy of sight to those of her own or of a different nature; visible in her faultless person n, and brightly shining, she passes not by the littleror the great.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ajāmim na parivṛṇakti jāmim: **jāmi** = sajātīya, of the same species, i.e. of divine beings, the gods;

Ajāmi = notof the same species; vijātīya, mankind; she passes not by: she lights up all things, from an atom to a mountain
