## English translation:

“Awaken, wealth-abounding, Uṣā, those whose delight (in holy offerings); let the (niggard) traders, reluctant wake (for such a purpose), sleep on. Arise, opulent Uṣā, bearing wealth to the liberal (worshipper); speaker of truth, who are the waster away (of living creatures), arise, bearing wealth to him who praises you.”
