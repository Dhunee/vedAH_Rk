## English translation:

“We declare by our birth from our ancient sire, that the tongue (of praise) accompanies the manifesting (invocation of the **Maruts**) at the libations of the **Soma**; for, inasmuch as they stood by encouraging **Indra** in the conflict, they have acquired names that are to be recited at sacrifices.”
