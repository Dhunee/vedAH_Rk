## English translation:

“When, **Maruts**, flying like birds along a certain path (of the sky), you collect the moving passing (clouds) in the nearest portions (of the firmament), then, coming into collision with your cars, they pour forth (the waters); therefore, do you shower upon your worshipper the honey-coloured rain.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Madhuvarṇam = having the colour of honey, i.e. being equally pure (**svaccha**)
