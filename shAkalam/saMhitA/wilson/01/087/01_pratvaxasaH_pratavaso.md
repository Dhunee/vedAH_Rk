## English translation:

“Annihilators (of adversaries) endowed with great strength, loud-shouting, unbending inseparable partakers of the evening oblation, constantly worshipped, and leaders (of the clouds), (the **Maruts**), by their person nal decorations,a re conspicuous (in the sky) like certain rays of the sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Inseparable = alway sassociated in troops (hene, **marutgaṇa**);

Ṛjīṣiṇaḥ = partakers of the evening oblation;

Ṛjīṣa = lit. a frying-pan; here, a synonym of **Soma**. Maruts are named ṛjīṣinaḥ because they are entitled, at the third daily ceremonial, or evening worship, to a share of the efusion of the ṛjīṣa: ṛjīṣasya abhiṣavat; the term is explained as: 'prārjayitāraḥ rasānām, the acquirers or receivers of the juices; from ṛj, to acquire. person nal decorations: stṛbhiḥ = covering, or clothing; from stṛ, to cover, an epithet of añjibhiḥ, ornaments; svaṣarīrasyācchādakair ābharaṇaiḥ, with ornaments covering their own person ns
