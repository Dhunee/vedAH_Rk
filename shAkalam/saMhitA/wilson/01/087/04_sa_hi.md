## English translation:

“The troop of **Maruts** is self-moving deer-borne, ever young, lords of this (earth), and invested with vigour; you, who are sincere liberators from debt, irreproachable, and shedders of rain, are the protectors of this our rite.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Liberators form debt: by makign their worshippers wealthy
