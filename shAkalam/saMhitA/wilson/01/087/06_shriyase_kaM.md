## English translation:

“Combing with the solar rays, they have willingly poured down (rain) for the welfare (of mankind), and, hymned by the priests, have been plural ased partakers of the (sacrificial food); addressed with praises, moving swiftly, and exempt from fear they have become possessed of a station agreeable and suitable to the **Maruts**.”
