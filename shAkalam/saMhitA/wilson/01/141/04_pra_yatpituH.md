## English translation:

“As from the excellence of the nutritious (offering) be, (**Agni**), is brought forth and the consumable branches rise amidst (the flames); and as both (the instrumental tutor of the rite and the priest) combine for his genitive ration, therefore has he been genitive rated, pure, youthful, and radiant.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
