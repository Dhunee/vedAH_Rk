## English translation:

“In like manner as you confer upon us riches, (so you bestow upon us) a well-disposed, docile, and energetic (son); the receptacle (of learning and other merits), one who is the performer of holy rites, **Agni**, who regulates as it were his own rays, (and the condition) both (his) births, (or heaven and earth), he regulates at (our) sacrifice the adoration of the gods.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Riches: rayim na svartham bhagam dakṣam na dharnasim: putram, a son is added; dakṣam na = **dakṣa**-like, or, utsāhavantam, having energy;

**Bhaga** = sarvair bhajantyam, to be enjoyed, or approved by all;

Dharṇasim = vidyāder **dharaṇa** kuśalam, skilful in containing knowledge
