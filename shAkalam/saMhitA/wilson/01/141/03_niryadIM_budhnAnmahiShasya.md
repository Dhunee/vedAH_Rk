## English translation:

“As powerful priests extract by force (of prayer) this **Agni** from his primitive seat, (for the evolution) of his mighty form; as the wind arouses him lurking in the hiding-plural ce (of the altar), for the sake of offering oblations now as of old.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

By the force (of prayer): or by bodily strength, applied to attrition as producing fire
