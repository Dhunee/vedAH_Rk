## English translation:

“Most youthful **Agni**, for the good of him who praises you and offers you libations, you make the precious (offering) acceptable to the gods; new-born of strength we glorify you who are to be lauded; to whom rich offerings (are to be presented); (we glorify you) in (our) hymn as (men eulogize) a powerful prince.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
