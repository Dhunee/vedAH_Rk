## English translation:

“Like a chariot drawn by ropes, **Agni**, set in movement by his own revolving members (his flames), proceeds to the heavens; the paths he traverses are blackened by smoke, as he consumes (the fuel), and (beasts and) birds fly from his radiance as (enemies fly from the prowess) of a hero.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Flames: angebhir aruṣebhiḥ gamanaśīlair avayavair jvālābhiḥ, by limbs, i.e., flames, having motion; beasts and birds: **vayaḥ** gamanavantaḥ pakṣimṛgādayaḥ, creatures having motion--birds, beasts and the like
