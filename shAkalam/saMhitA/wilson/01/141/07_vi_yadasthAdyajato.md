## English translation:

“Since the adorable (**Agni**), impelled by the wind, spreads in various directions, like an insincere and unrestrained chatterer, (who utters indiscriminate) praises, therefore the world is assiduous in the worship of him, the consumer of all, whose way is dark, who is pure of birth and follows various paths.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like an insincere: hvāro na vakvā **jaraṇā** anākṛtaḥ: hvāraḥ = **kuṭila**, crooked;

Vakvā = bahuvaktā, a prolific speaker;

Anākṛtaḥ = unrestrained, anivāritaḥ;

**Jaraṇaḥ** = **stutiḥ**, praises
