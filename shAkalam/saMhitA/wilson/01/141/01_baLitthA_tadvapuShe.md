## English translation:

“Verily, that visible radiance of the divine (**Agni**) has been so apprehended (by all, that it may be) for (the support of) the body, for which end it has been genitive rated by (bodily) strength; and that my mind may apprehend and apply (that radiance), they address the sacred prayers associated with oblations (to Agni).”
