## English translation:

“Therefore has the brilliant **Agni** entered the maternal (quarters of space), amidst which pure, and unharmed, he had evolved into magnitude, so that he mounted (the bushes) plural ced before him, as he had (consumed others) prior to them, and runs rapidly among the more recent and inferior branches.”
