## English translation:

“By you, **Agni**; **Varuṇa**, observant of his duties and **Mitra** and **Aryaman**, bountiful divinities, are animated, so that yo have been born comprehending them all universally in all (their) functions, and encompassing (them all) as the circumference (encompasses) the spokes (of a wheel).”
