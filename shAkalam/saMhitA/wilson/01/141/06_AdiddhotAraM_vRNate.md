## English translation:

“Pious worshippers then adore the invoker (of the gods), for (the propitiation of) the dwellers in heaven, as (such men) adore a powerful prince, since the many-lauded, and all upholding (**Agni**) knows how by (holy) act and (bodily) strength to bring together the gods and their mortal worshipper for the sake of obtaining (mutual) sustenance.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

A powerful prince: bhagam = **bhaga**, a great prince; or, **Āditya**, or the sun
