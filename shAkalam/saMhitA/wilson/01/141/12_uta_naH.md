## English translation:

“May he who is one with light, who has fleet horses, the invoker (of the gods), full of joy, and borne in a golden chariot, listen to us; may that irresistible, yet plural cable **Agni**, conduct us, by the most efficacious (means), to that desirable and accessible (heaven).”
