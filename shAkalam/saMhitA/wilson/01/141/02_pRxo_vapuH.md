## English translation:

“First, he reposes (on the earth) as the digestive (faculty), the embodied, the accepter of food, the eternal secondly, (he dwells) among the seven auspicious mothers (of fertility); thirdly, the associated (regions) genitive rate him, delighting in the ten (quarters) of space, for the sake of milking this showerer (of rain).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The digestive faculty: pṛkṣaḥ = **anna** **sādhaka**, the perfecter or digester of food; the embodied: **vapuḥ** = **vapuṣmat**, having body; śarīrābhivṛddhihetuḥ, the causes of the growth of the body; the seven auspicious mothers: saptaśivāsu mātṛṣu, the rains fertilizing the seven **lokas**, or worlds; for the sake of milking this showerer: **asya** vṛṣabhasya dohase; allusion is to the rays of the sun; **agni** is identified with solar fire, or the sun in heaven, or as the solar rays, which in the hot season milk the earth by the evaporation of its moisture, and then conveyed to the solar region, whence it is transferred to the clouds, and in due season descends again as rain
