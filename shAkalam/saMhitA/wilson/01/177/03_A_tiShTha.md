## English translation:

“Ascend your bounty-shedding car, for you the **Soma**, the showerer of benefits, is effused, the sweet libations are prepared. Bounty-shedding **Indra**, having harnessed them, come with your vigorous steeds for (the good of) mankind; come with your rapid (car) to my presence.”
