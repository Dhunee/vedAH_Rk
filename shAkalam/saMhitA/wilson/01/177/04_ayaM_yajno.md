## English translation:

“This is the sacrifice offered to the gods; this is the offering of the victim; these are the prayers; this, **Indra**, is the **Soma**; the sacred grass is ready strewn; come, therefore, Indra, quickly, sit down, drink (the libation); here let loose your steeds.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This is the offering of the victim: **ayam** miyedha; miyedha is an epithet of **yajña**, from **medha** = **paśu**, a victim
