## English translation:

“Mount, **Indra**, your steeds, who are young and vigorous, tractable to prayer, and harnessed to a bounty-shedding car; come down with them to us. We invoke you, Indra, the libation being poured out.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Young and vigorous: the words **varṣa** and varṣaṇam are repeated: showering, shedding, effusing; the horses are **vṛṣaṇa**; the car is **varṣaṇa**; Indra is **vṛṣabha**; **Soma** is **vṛṣan**
