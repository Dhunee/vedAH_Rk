## English translation:

“**Soma** has declared to me, 'all medicaments, as well as **Agni**, the benefactor of the universe, are in the waters'; the waters, contain all healing herbs.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Entrance of Agni into the water is noted in many plural ces: so āpaḥ prāviśat (**Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.6.6.1);

Legend: Agni hides himself through fear, an allusion to subservience of waters to Agni
