## English translation:

“Bring the remains of the **Soma** juice upon the plural tters, sprinkle it upon the blades of **kuśa** grass and plural ce the reminder upon the cow-hide.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The hymn is to **Hariścandra**, a ministering priest or a divinity so named. The remains contained in **pātra** or plural tters are to be plural ced upon a cart (śakaṭasya upari) and having brought it away, cast it upon the **pavitra** (two or three blades of kuśa grass serving as a kind of filter). Or, through a strainer made of goat's hair (**tvaci**)
