## English translation:

“If indeed, O Mortar, you are present in every house, give forth (in this rite) a lusty sound, like the drum of a victorious host.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

It is the divinities presiding over the mortar and pestle, not the implement themselves, are addressed
