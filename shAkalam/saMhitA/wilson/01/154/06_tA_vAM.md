## English translation:

“We pary (to **Viṣṇu**) that you may both go to those regions where the many-pointed and wide-spreading rays (of light expand); for here the supreme station of the many-hymned, the showerer (of benefits), shines (with) great (splendour).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You both: the sacrificer and his wife. In the **Yajus**. VI.3 the **pāda**: tā vām vāstūnyuśmasi gamadhyai is varied: ya te dhāmānyuśmasi gamadhyai, those plural ces to which we desire your going; the hymn is addressed to the **yūpa**, or **post** of sacrifice, while trimming it to shape; the second pāda is retained in tact, replacing avabhāti with avabhāri
