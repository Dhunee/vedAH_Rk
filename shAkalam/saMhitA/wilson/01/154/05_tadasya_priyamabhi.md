## English translation:

“May I attain his favourite path, in which god-seeking men delight; (the path) of that wide-stepping **Viṣṇu**, in whose exalted station there is a (perpetual) flow of felicity; for to such a degree is he the friend (of the pious).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

His favourite path: the firmament: patho anatarikṣam
