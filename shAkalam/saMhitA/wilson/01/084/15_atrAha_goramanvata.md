## English translation:

“The (solar rays) found on this occasion the light of **Tvaṣṭā** verily concealed in the mansion of the moving moon.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The text has only 'they found'; **Āditya**-raśmayaḥ, rays of the sun is added. Tvaṣṭā = the Sun, an Āditya; also, identified with **Indra**, to whom the hymn is addressed. 'The rays of the sun are reflected back in the bright watery orb of the moon'; 'the solar radiance, concealed by the night, enters into the moon, and thus dispels darkness by night, as well as by day'. One ray of the sun (that named śuṣumnā lights up the moon; therefore, moon's light is derived from the sun (**Nirukta** 2,6)(cf. **Viṣṇu Purāṇa** 36)
