## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dadhyañc = **Dadhīca** and Dadhīci, a sage. His bones formed the thunderbolt of Indra. dadhyañc, son of **Atharvan**, like the **asuras**, was intimidated and tranquilized by his appearance; but, when he went to **svarga**, the asuras overspread the whole earth. Indra, inquiring what had become of him and if something of him was left behind, was told that the horse's head with which he had at one time taught the **madhuvidyā** to the **aśvins**, was somewhere in existence, but no one knew where. After a searth, it was found in the lake Śaryaṇāvat, near **Kurukṣetra**. With the bones of the skull, Indra slew the asuras (i.e. foiled the nine times ninety or eight hundred and ten, strategems or devices of the asuras or Vṛtras\]. The number is accounted for by the legend that in the beginning, the **āsurī** **māyā** (demoniac illusion) was practised in the **three worlds**, for three periods (past, present, and future), thus becoming nine-fold; each was exerted with three **śaktis** or energies, thus becoming twenty seven; each was again modified by the three **guṇas**, thus becoming eighty-one; the scene of their display extended to each of the ten regions of space, thus becoming the nine times ninety of the text, or 810
