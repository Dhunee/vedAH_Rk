## English translation:

“Who goes forth, (through dread of foes, when **Indra** is at **hand**); who is harmed (by his enemies); who is terrified; who is aware that Indra is present, who that he is night? What need is there that any one should importune Indra for his son, his elephant, his property, his person n, or his people?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kaḥ = **prajāpati**
