## English translation:

“Who praises the (sacrificial) fire, (lighted for **Indra**), or worships him with the oblation of clarified butter, presented in the ladle, according to the constant seasons? To whom do the gods quickly bring (the wealth) that has been called for? What sacrificer, engaged in offering oblations and favoured by the gods, thoroughly knows Indra?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛtubhir dhruvebhiḥ, according to the constant seasons; alternative reading: 'presented by the divinities called Ṛtus, who preside over sacrifices' (e.g., ṛtavo vai prayājāḥ, the ṛtus are the chief sacrifices, i.e. prayājādevatāḥ, the deities presiding over the sacrifices).
