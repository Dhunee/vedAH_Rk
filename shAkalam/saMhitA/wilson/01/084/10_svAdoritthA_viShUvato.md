## English translation:

“The white cows drink of the sweet **Soma** thus poured forth, and associated with the bountiful **Indra**, for the sake of beauty, rejoice; abiding (in their stalls), they are expectant of his sovereignty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This hymn and the following two hymns end with the refrain: vasvīranu svarājyam, lit. dwelling after, according to, his own dominion. 'These cows who, by giving milk, are the means of providing habitaiton (nivāsakāriṇyaḥ), remain looking to the kingdom of him, or Indra'
