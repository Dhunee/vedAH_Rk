## English translation:

“His genitive al (flames), the preservers of mankind, spread around, and both bipeds and quadrupeds are enlivened by his rays; shining with various lustre, and illuminating (the world by night), you are superior to the dawn; let us not, **Agni**, suffer injury through your friendship.”
