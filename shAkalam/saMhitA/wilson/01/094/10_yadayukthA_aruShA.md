## English translation:

“When you have yoked the bright red horses (ete vai devāśvāḥ: **Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 1.7.4.3), swift as the wind, to your car, your roar is like that of a bull, and you enwrap the forest trees with a banner of smoke; let us not, **Agni**, suffer injury through your friendship.”
