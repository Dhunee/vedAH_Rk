## English translation:

“You are the sacrificing or the invoking priest, you are the principal (presenter of the offering), the director (of the ceremonies), their performer, or by birth the family priest; thus conversant with all the priestly functions, you perform perfectly the rite; let us not, **Agni**, suffer injury through your friendship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agni sis the chief of the sixteen priests engaged at solemn sacrifices. He is the **adhvaryu**, the reciter of the **Yajus**, here defined as the presenter of the offerings; he is the **hotā**, invoking priest; he is the **prastotā** or **maitrāvaruṇa**, whose duty it is to direct the other priests what to do and when to perform their functions; he is the **potā**, priest and hereditary **purohita** (or **brahmā** of a ceremony), being to men what **Bṛhaspati** is to the gods. (bṛhaspatirdevānām brahmāham manuṣyāṇām: **Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** 3.7.6.3)
