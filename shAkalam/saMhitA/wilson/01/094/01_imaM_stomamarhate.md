## English translation:

“To him who is worthy of praise, and all-knowing, we construct, with our minds, this hymn, as (a workman makes) a car; happy is our understanding when engaged in his adoration; let us not suffer injury, **Agni**, through your friendship.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The refrain: sakhye mā riṣāmā vayam tava = may we not be injured in or by your friendship, i.e. do you preserve us.
