## English translation:

“Do you, divine **Agni**, who kno what is good fortune, on this occasion prolong our existence, and may **Mitra**, **Varuṇa**, **Aditi**, ocean, earth and heaven, preserve it to us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The second **pāda** of this hymn terminates the following **sūktas** from 95 to 101 (with teo exceptions). **Sindhu**: divinity presiding over, or identified with, flowing water; and it may mean either the sea, or flowing steams collectively, or the river Sindhu. **Pṛthivī** and Dyu are the person nified earth and heaven. These are requested to honour, i.e. to preserve or perpetuate, whatever blessing has been asked for (tan māmahantam); from **maha** = to venerate or worship;

Tad = that, refers to **āyus** or life
