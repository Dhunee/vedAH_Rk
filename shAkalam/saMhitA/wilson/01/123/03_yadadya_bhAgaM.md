## English translation:

“Well-born and divine Uṣā, who are the protectress of mortals; whatever share (of light) you apportion today to men, may the radiant **Savitā** bedisposed (to confirm) the gift, and declar us free from sin; so that (he) the sun (may come to our sacrificial hall).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bhāgam, a share (of light, prakāśasya);or, a share of the offerings to the gods; so that the sun may come: the text has only sūryāya, for the sake of the sun
