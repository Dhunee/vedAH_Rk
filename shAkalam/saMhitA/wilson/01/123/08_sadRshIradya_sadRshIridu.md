## English translation:

“The same today, the same tomorrow, the irreproachable (dawn) precede the distant course of **Varuṇa** by thirtyyojanas, and each in succession revolves in its (appointed) office.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Varuṇa = sun, the remover of darkness, revolving daily round **Mount Meru**, the centre of the earth, performing a diurnal circuit of 5,059 **yojanas**; the dawn being always 30 yojanas in advance of his rising, or first appearance frombehind the mountain in the east,the period called dawn is reckoned from the disappearance of the stars to the appearance of the sun, and is measured, as to the duration, by 21 **ghaṭikās** and 26 **paras**. Taking the **ghaṭikā** at its lowest valuation of half a **muhūrta**, or 24 minutes, and **a para** as 1/30th of a ghaṭikā, in a day of 30 ghaṭikās, more than one-third is allotted to the dawn. The sun's daily journey equates to more than 20,000 miles, i.e. the equatorial circumference of the earth. According to the **Purāṇas**, the sun travels, in a day of 30 **muhurtas**, or 60 ghaṭikās, 94,500,000 yojanas or 1,575,000 yojanas in one ghaṭikā. One ghaṭikā is assigned to the **sandhya**, the morning twilight or dawn, and 3 muhurtas or 2 hours 24 minutes, to the Pratar, or early morning (Bently, Hindu Astronomy, p. 185)
