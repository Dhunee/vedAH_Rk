## English translation:

“First of all the world is she awake, triumphing over transitory (darkness); the mighty, the giver (of light) from on high, she beholds (all things); ever youthful, ever reviving, she comes first to the invocation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Jayantī** vājam: **vāja**, moving, motive; the darkness that goes away with the dawn; or, food, producing food (**annam** vai **vājaḥ**: **Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa** 9.3.4.1), as the reward of the morning sacrifice
