## English translation:

“Come, **Maruts**, with your brilliant light-moving, well-weaponed, steed-harnessed chariots; doers of good deeds, descend like birds, (and bring us) abundant food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Maruts: explanations: They sound (ruvanti, from ru), having attained mid-heaven (mitam); they sound without measure (amitam); they shine (from ruc) in the clouds made (mitam) by themselves; they hasten (**dravanti**) in the sky. 'All feminine les whose station is the middle heaven, the all-pervading masculine **Vāyu**, and all the troops (of **demigods**), are Maruts'. Also cited: the legend of the birth of the forty-nine Maruts, in seven troops, as the sons of **Kaśyapa** (**Viṣṇu Purāṇa**, 152)
