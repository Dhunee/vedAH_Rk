## English translation:

“Or they may be discovered (in the dark), as thieves in the (dusk of) evening; for although they be unseen, yet all are seen by them; therefore, men, be vigilant.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Discovered in the dark: as snakes by their breathing; yet all are seen by them: viśvadṛṣṭā, undertood it as a **bahuvrīhi** compound
