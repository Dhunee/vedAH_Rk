## English translation:

“I deposit the poison in the solar orb, like a leather bottle in the house of a vendor of spirits; verily, that adorable (Sun) never dies; nor, (through his favour), shall we die (of the venom); for, though afar off, yet drawn by his coursers, he will overtake (the poison); the science of antidoes converted you, (Poison), to ambrosia.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This and the following three hymns are derived from the **viṣa vidyā**, the science of poisons,or of antidoes, whence it is also termed **madhu-vidyā**, science of ambrosia; 'having taken the poison in the solar orb with the fourth finger, having made it ambrosia and caused them to blend together, may it become poisonless'; **sūrya maṇḍala** or orb of the sun; or, perhaps a reference to a mystical diagram or figure typical of the solar orb;

Madhuta = **madhu vidyā** was originally taught by **Indra** to Dadhyañc, who communicated it to the **Aśvins**, and thereby lost his head
