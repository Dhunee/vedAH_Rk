“The all-seeing Sun rises in the east, the destroyer of the unseen, driving away all the unseen (venomous creatures), and all evil spirits.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Destroyer of the unseen: adṛṣṭhā may also mean the dissipator of darkness; **adṛṣṭa** occurs in the sense of invisible venomous creatures, these as well as the **yātudhānas**, or **rākṣasas**, disappear at sunrise; cf. AV 5.23.6
