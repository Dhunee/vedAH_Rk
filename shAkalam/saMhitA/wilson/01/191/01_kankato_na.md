## English translation:

“Some creature of little venom, some creature of great venom; or some venomous aquatic reptile; creatures of two kinds, both destructive (of life),or (poisonous) unseen creatures, have anointed me with their poison.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The **sūkta** is a mystical antidote against poison. This was recited by **Agastya** under an apprehension of having been poisoned. **kaṅkata**, na kaṅkata, **satīna** kaṅkata = alpaviṣaḥ kas;cit, something of little venom; tadviparīto analpaviṣo mahoragāi, the opposite of that of not little venom, like great snakes and the like;

**Satina** = water; of two kinds: of little or of much venom; or creatures of land or water; unseen creatures: adṛṣṭā = of invisible forms; the appellation of certain poisonous insects; a class of poisons, or of poisonous creatures: viśaviśeṣaḥ **viṣadhara** **viśeṣa** vā; having anointed: alipsata = have smeared, have spread over all the limbs
