## English translation:

“Those (who move with their) shoulders, those (who move with their) bodies, those who sting with sharp fangs, those who are virulently venomous; what do you here, you unseen, depart together far from us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Those who move: ye aṃsyā ye aṅgyāḥ, what relates to the shoulders, or the body genitive rally;

Aṃsyā = being suited to the shoulders, moving with or by them, born or produced in or on them, biting with them: aṃsārhāḥ, aṃsagāḥ, aṃse **bhavāḥ**, aṃsābhyām khādantaḥ;

Aṃgyā = moving with the body or poisoning with the body, as certain spiders, whose contact is poisonous, and the like; who stings with sharp fangs: sucīkāḥ, having sharp needle-like stings, like a scorpion
