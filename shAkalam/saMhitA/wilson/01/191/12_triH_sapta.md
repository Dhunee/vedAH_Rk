## English translation:

“May the thrice-seven sparks (of **Agni**) consume the influence of the venom; they verily do not perish;nor shall we die; for, although afar off, the Sun, drawn by his coursers, will overtake the poison; the science of antidotes has converted you, (Poison), to ambrosia.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The thice seven sparks: the seven tongues, or flames of fire, may be multiplied as red, white and black; or viśpuliṅgakā = catikā, a feminine le sparrow of which there are 21 varieties, eaters of poison with impunity
