## English translation:

“(the antidote), coming (to the bitten person n), destroys the unseen (venomous creatures); departing (it destroys them); deprived (of substance), it destroys them (by its odour); being ground, it pulverises them.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Deprives of substance: avaghnatī = avahanyamānaauṣadhiḥ, a drug or antidote being destroyed; losing its substance, and reduced to its odour; or it may mean that a certain drug,understood, is destructive of poisonous creatures
