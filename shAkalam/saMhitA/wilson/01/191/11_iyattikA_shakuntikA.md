## English translation:

“That little insignifcant bird has swallowed your venom; she does not die; nor shall we die; for, although afar off, yet drawn by his coursers, (the Sun) will overtake (the poison); the science of antidotes has converted you, (Poison), to ambrosia.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The insignificant bird: the feminine le **kapiñjala**, or francoline partridge, which was known as a remover of poison, **viṣa** hartrī
