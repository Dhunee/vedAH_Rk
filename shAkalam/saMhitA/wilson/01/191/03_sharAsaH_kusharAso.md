## English translation:

“(Blades of) **śarā** grass, (of) kuśarā, (of) **darbha**, (of) sairyā, (of) **muñja**, (of) **vīraṇa**, all (the haunt) of unseen (venomous creatures), have together anointed me (with their venom).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Blades of śarā: these are, saccarum **śara**, poa cynosuroides, saccharum spontaneum, saccarum muñja, andropogon muricatum, long-reed like grasses, amidst which reptiles may lurk unseen
