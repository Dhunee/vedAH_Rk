## English translation:

“May the insignificant mongoose (carry off) your venom, (Poison); if not, I will crush the vile (creature) with a stone; so may the poison depart (from my body) and go to distant regions.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The mongoose: kuṣumbako **nakulaḥ**, the mongoose, whose hostility to the snake is proverbial
