## English translation:

“May the thrice-seven peahens, the seven-sister rivers, carry off, (O Body), your poison, as maidens, with pitchers, carry away water.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Thrice-seven peahen: tri saptamayūryaḥ, an allusion to the enmity between peafowl and snakes; 21 varities of mayurī or peahen; the seven rivers are those of heaven, or the branches of the divine **gaṅgā**; all running streams are possibly regarded as antidotes
