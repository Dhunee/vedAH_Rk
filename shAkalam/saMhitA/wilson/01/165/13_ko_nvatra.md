## English translation:

“(**Agastya**): What mortal, **Maruts**, worships you in this world; hasten, friends, to the presence of your friends; wonderful (divinities), be to them the means of acquiring riches, and be not uncognizant of my merits.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be not uncognizant: eṣām **bhūta** navedā me ṛtānām = be cognizant of these my truths, madīyānām avitathānām jñātāro bhavata
