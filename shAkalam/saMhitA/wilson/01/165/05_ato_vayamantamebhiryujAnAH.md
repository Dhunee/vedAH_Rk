## English translation:

“ (The **Maruts**): Therefore we also, decorating our person ns, are ready, with our docile and night-standing steeds, (to attend) you, with all our splendour, to those rites; verily, **Indra**, you appropriate our (sacrificial) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You appropriate: svadhām anu hi no babhūtha, you have been upon or after our food; or, balam, strength; or, udakam, water; i.e. you seek after the oblations genitive rated either by our strenght, or the water we have created
