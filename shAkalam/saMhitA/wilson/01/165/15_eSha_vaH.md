## English translation:

“This praise, **Maruts**, is for you; this hymn is for you, (the work) of a venerable author, capable of conferring delight (by his laudations). May the praise reach you, for (the good of your) person ns, so that we may (thence) obtain food, strength, and long life.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Capable of conferring: māndāyasya kāroḥ: the epithet is stutiviśeṣair mandayituḥ; or, stutibhir madasya prerayituḥ, causer of plural asure by praises; food, strength and long life: iṣam vṛjanam jīradānum: jīradānum = jayaśīlam **dānam**, donation connected with victory; the hymn is repeated at the end of the next **sūkta**; where it is explained as: cirakāla jīvanam, long life
