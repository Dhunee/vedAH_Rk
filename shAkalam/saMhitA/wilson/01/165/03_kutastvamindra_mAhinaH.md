## English translation:

“(The **Maruts**): **Indra**, lord of the good, whither do you, who are entitled to honour, proceed alone; what means this (absence of attendance); when followed (by us), you require (what is right); lord of fleet horses say to us, with plural asant words, that which you (have to say) to us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

You require what is right: sampṛcchase = samīcīnam pṛccase
