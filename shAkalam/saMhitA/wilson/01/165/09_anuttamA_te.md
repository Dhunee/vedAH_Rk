## English translation:

“(The **Maruts**): Verily, Maghvan, nothing (done) by you is unavailing; there is no divinity as wise as you; no one being born, or that has been born, ever surpasses the glorious deeds which you, mighty (**Indra**), have achieved.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Verily, **Maghavan**: anuttamā te maghavan nakir nu na = whatever is said by you, Indra, is true;

Anuttamā = an exclamation or assent that which is not sent or driven away
