## English translation:

“The sun, who is avowedly made the path in heaven, is not to be disregarded, Gods, by you; but you, mortals, regard him not. Heaven and earth be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Asau yaḥ panthā ādityo **divi** pravācyam **kṛtaḥ**: panthā is an epithet of **Āditya**, the sun, as satatagamī, the ever-going; interpreted as a path, the sun is the road to heaven: sūryadvāreṇa **virajāḥ** prayānti, those who are free from **soul** go by the gate of the sun
