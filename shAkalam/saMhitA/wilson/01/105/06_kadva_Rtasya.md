## English translation:

“Where, deities, is your observance of the truth, where the (benignant) regard of **Varuṇa**, where is the path of the mighty **Aryaman**, (so that) we may overcome the malevolent? Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Varuṇa and Aryaman: Varuṇa is the obstructor of evil, which is undesired (aniṣṭanivāraka); Aryaman, is the restrainer of enemies (ariṇām niyantā)
