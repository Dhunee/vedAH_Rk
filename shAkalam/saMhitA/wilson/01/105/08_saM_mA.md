## English translation:

“The ribs (of the well close) round me, like the rival wives (of one husband); cares consume me, **Śatakratu**, although your worshipper, as a rat (gnaws a weaver's) threads. Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Weaver's threads: the threads are steepd in rice-water to add to the tension, and hence, become palatable to rats; the rendering is: 'As a rat gnaws, or licks, its tail, having just dipped it in oil or grease' (**Nirukta** 4.6). **Manu** (VIII.397) notes that the cloth returned shall be heavier than the thread given, because threads should be thickened with starch
