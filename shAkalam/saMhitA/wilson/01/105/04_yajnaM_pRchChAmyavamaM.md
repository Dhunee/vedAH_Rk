## English translation:

“I implore the first (of the gods), the object of sacrifice, that he will become my messenger, and narrate (my condition to the other deities). Where, **Agni**, is your former benevolence, what new being now possesses it? Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agnir-vai devānām avamaḥ, the first-produced of all the gods (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 1.1); agnir-mukham prathamo devatānām, Agni is the mouth, the first of the deities (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 1.4)
