## English translation:

“Those which are the seven rays (of the sun), in them is my navel expanded; **Trita**, the son of the waters, knows that (it is so), and he praises them for his extrication (from the well). Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Nābhi** = navel; teṣu sūryaraśmiṣu adhyātmam saptaprāṇarūpeṇa varmāneṣu, identifying the solar rays with the seven vital airs abiding in the ruling spirit; this is perhaps an allusion to the navel as the seat of the **soul**. Son of the waters: āptya = **āpya** = apām **putra**, son of the waters
