## English translation:

“Never, Gods, may this (my ancestry), abiding above in heaven, be excluded (from it); never may we be in want (of a son), the cause of joy (to his progenitors), entitled to libations of the **Soma**. Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Be excluded from it: **Trita** anticipates for himself a failure of posterity: 'by a son a man conquers the worlds; there is no world (**loka**) for one who has no son' (nāputrasya lokosti) (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 7.13)
