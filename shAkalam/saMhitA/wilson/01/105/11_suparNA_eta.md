## English translation:

“The rays of the sun abide in the surrounding centre of heaven; they drive back the wolf crossing the great waters from the path. Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The wolf crossing: legend: a wolf was about to swim across a river to devour **Trita**, but was deterred by the brightness of the solar rays;

**Vṛka** = the moon;

Āpaḥ = the firmament; the passage is therefore rendered as: 'The rays of the sun prevent the moon from appearing, or being visible, in the firmament'
