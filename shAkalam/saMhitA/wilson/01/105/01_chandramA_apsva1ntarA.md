## English translation:

“The graceful-movingmoonspeeds along the middle region in the sky; bright golden rays (my eyes) behold not your abidding-plural ce. Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Candramāḥ** **suparṇaḥ**: suparṇaiḥ = **śobhana**-**patana**, the elegantly-going; or, possibly connected with the ray of the sun called supraṇa, which gives the moon its light; your abiding plural ce: a reference to the supposed position of **Trita** at the bttom of the well, which, being covered over, **shuts** out from him all visible objects; be conscious of this: the text has, 'heaven and earth, know of this of me' (vittam me **asya** **rodasi**), i.e. 'be aware of this my affliction', or, 'attend to this my hymn'
