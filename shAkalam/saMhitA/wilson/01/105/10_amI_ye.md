## English translation:

“May the five shedders (of benefits), who abide in the centre of the expanded heavens, having together conveyed my prayers quickly to the gods, (speedily) return. Heaven and earth, be conscious of this (my affliction).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Five shedders of benefits: They are: **Indra**, **Varuṇa**, **Agni**, **Aryaman**, and **Savitā**; or, fire, wind, the sun, the moon and the lightning, for these are luminous in their respective spheres; or, fire upon earth, wind in the firmament, the sun in heaven, the moon in the plural netary region, and lightning in the clouds. **Taittirīya** **Āraṇyaka** (1.20.1) substitutes the **nakṣatras** (asterisms shining in the **svar-loka**) for lightning
