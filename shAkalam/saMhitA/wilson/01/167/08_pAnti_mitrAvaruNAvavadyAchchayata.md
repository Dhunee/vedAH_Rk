## English translation:

“**Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, and **Aryaman**, defend (this) sacrifice from (all that is) reprehensible, and destroy (all that are) unworthy. They cause the yet unfallen and showering (rains) to descend, when, **Maruts**, the water-yielding (season) gives increase to this (world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

When the water-yielding season: vāvṛdha im maruto dātivāraḥ: the last term may refer to the **yajamāna**; i.e. when, Maruts, the worshipper, or he by whom the offering is presented, promotes this your increase
