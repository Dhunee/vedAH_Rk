## English translation:

“In whom the water-shedding, golden-coloured lighting, is fitly deposited like a chaplet (of clouds) moving in the firmament like the (splendidly-attired) wife of a man (of rank), and distinguished in assemblies like a sacrificial hymn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Guhā** caranti manuṣo na **yoṣā**, going in the darkness of the sky, as if it was in private or in secret, like the wife of a man, who, although, is brilliantly attired, remains in the privacy of the feminine le apartments, suveṣāntahpura eva madhye **carati**; distinguished in assemblies: sabhāvati vidatheva sam. vāk; the first is referred to the lightning, which, at times, shows itself as if in an assembly, **sabhā**; the reference may also be to yoṣā, a woman who is not always restricted to the private chambers, but appears occasionally in public
