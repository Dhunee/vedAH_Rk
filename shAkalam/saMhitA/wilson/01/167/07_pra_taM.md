## English translation:

“I celebrate that greatness of the **Maruts**, which is true, and worthy of celebration, inasmuch as their high-minded,haughty, and ever-enduring (bride), supports a flourishing progeny.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

High-minded, haughty: The epithets, vṛṣamaṇā, ahaṃyuḥ, **sthirā** are feminine nine; the reference is to **Rodasī**, the wife of the Maruts, who, by contributing to the rain, assists in the sustenance of mankind
