## English translation:

“May the **Maruts** come to our presence with benefaction; may they who are possessed of knowledge (come) with most excellent and brilliant (treasures), since their glorious horses, the **Niyutas**, gather wealth even on the farther shore of the sea.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Samudrasya cid dhanayanta **pāra**, bearing or collecting wealth, even on the farther shore of the sea; parasmin, on the other bank; metaphorically, the explanation is: winds bring wealth, i.e. rain, from the skirts of the horizon or firmament
