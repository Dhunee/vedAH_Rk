## English translation:

“**Rodasī**, the associate of the scatterers (of the clouds), with dishevelled tresses, and mind devoted to her lords, woos them to associate (with her); radiant in form, she has ascended the car of the restless (**Maruts**) as **Sūrya** (ascended the car of the **Aśvins**), and comes hither (with the celerity) of the sun.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rodasī = heaven and earth; here, it signifies the lightning; or the bride of the Maruts, marutpatnī vidyud vā;

Sūrya: sūryeva, like sūrya; either the wife or the daughter of sūrya
