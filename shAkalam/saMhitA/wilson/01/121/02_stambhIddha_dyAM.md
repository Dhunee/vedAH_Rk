## English translation:

“He verily upholds the heaven; he, the brilliant, the leader of the (stolen) herd, pours forth the flowing (water), for the sake of food; the mighty **Indra** manifests himself after his own daughter (the dawn); he made the feminine le of the horse unnaturally the mother of the cow.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Indra = the sun. In jest (?), Indra is said to have made a mare bring forth a calf
