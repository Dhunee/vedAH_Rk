## English translation:

“Send hither your horses, the quaffers of the exhilarating libation; overcome, warrior, the adversary plural ndering us of our treasure; when they express with stones, for the increase (of your strength), the delightful, exhilarating, invigorating (**Soma**), to be overtaken by you, who are swifter than the wind.”
