## English translation:

“When the bright-edged hatchet is ready for its work, the directing priest is able to have the victim bound in the sacrifice; when **Indra**, you shine upon the days that are appropriated to sacred rites, then (success attends) upon the man who goes with his cart (for fuel), the driver (of cattle), or the active (shepherd).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hatchet: vanadhiti, the weapon used to cut down the trees in the forest; **pari** **rodhanā** goḥ: the phrase has no verb; it is explained as: pasvi rodhanāya yupe niyojāya, pari samartho **bhavati**, the priest, the **adhvaryu**, is competent for the attachment of the animal to the stake. Alternative: vanadhiti = a collection of water (goḥ = water or rain;

**Vana** = **meghamālā**, body of clouds, ready to rain); hence, Indra in the firmament is able to remove any impediment to the shower. Upon the man who goes: anarviśe paśviṣe turāya = to the cartman to the cattle-driver, to the quick; explained as: abhimatam sidhyet = his wish may succeed;

Anarviśe = cartman, 'he who goes to fetch fuel from the wood, in his cart';

Paśviṣe = the driver of cattle;

Turāya = active or quick;

**Gopāla** = shepherd
