## English translation:

“Stop, **Sūra**, your yellow horses, for this **Etaśa**, **Indra**, drags the wheel; having driven those who offer no sacrifices to the opposite bank of the ninety rivers, you compel them (to do) what is to be done.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sūra = Indra, as the sun;

Etaśa = a horse of the sun; also the name of a Ṛṣi; ninety rivers = nāvyānām, of navigable rivers, or of such as must be crossed by a boat
