## English translation:

“You did hurl your metal bolt upon the quick-moving (**asura**), the swift destroyer of foes, that was brought (to you) by **Ṛbhu** from heaven; when you, who are worshipped by many, striking **Śuṣṇa**, for the sake of **Kutsa**, did encompass him with numberless fatal (weapons).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Brought by Ṛbhu from heaven: divo ānītam Ṛbhvā;

Ṛbhu = **Tvaṣṭā**, fabricator of **Indra**'s thunderbolt. Śuṣṇa = drought; Indra removes drought for the benefit of his worshippers,by many drops of rain
