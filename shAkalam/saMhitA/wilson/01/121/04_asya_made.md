## English translation:

“In the exhilaration of the **Soma**, you have restored the celebrated herd of cattle, hidden (in the cave), for the sake of sacrifice, (to the **Aṅgirasas**); when, **Indra**, the threefold crest engages in combat, he opens the doors of the tyrannical descendants of **Manu**”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Threefold crest: elevated as a triple crest in the **three worlds**
