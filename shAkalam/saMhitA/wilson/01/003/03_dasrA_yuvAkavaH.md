## English translation:

“**Aśvins**, destroyers of foes, exempt from untruth, leaders in the van of heroes, come to the mixed libations sprinkled on the lopped sacred grass.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Darsa** = destroyers of foes or diseases; '**aśvinau** vai devānām bhiṣajau--iti sruteḥ', the two aśvins are verily the physicians of the gods, according to the **Veda**. **rudra**-**vartani**: rudra, from rud, weeping; yad arodīt tad rudrasya rudratvam: in as much as he wept, thence came the property or function of rudra (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 1.5.1.1); hence, Rudra = heroes, they who make their enemies weep;

Vartani = a road or way; in this hymn, it is the front of the way, the van; hence rudra, heroes are in the van of warriors. vṛktabarhiṣaḥ: **kuśa** grass has the roots cut off and is spread on the **vedī** (altar) and upon it is added the libation of **Soma**, or oblation of clarified butter, poured; it is also a seat for the deity or deities invoked to the sacrifice
