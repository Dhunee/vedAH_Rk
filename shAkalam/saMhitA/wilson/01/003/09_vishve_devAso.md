## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ehimāyāsaḥ: those who have obtained knowledge universally, sarvataḥ vyāptaprajñaḥ; or, the term may refer to a legend: **viśvedevas** addressed **Agni**, **Saucika**, who had gone into the water, saying ehi, come, mā yāsiḥ, do not go away; hence they got the appellation, ehimāyāsaḥ
