## English translation:

“you, **Indra**, of whom heaven and earth have not attained the amplitude; of whom the waters of heaven have not reached the limit; of whom, when warring with excited animation against the withholder of the rains, (his adversaries have not equalled the prowess); you alone have made everything else, (than yourself), dependent (upon you).”
