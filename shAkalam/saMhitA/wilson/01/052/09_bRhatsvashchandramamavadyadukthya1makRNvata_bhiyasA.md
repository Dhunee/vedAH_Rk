## English translation:

“Through fear (of **Vṛtra**, they, the worshippers), recited the suitable hymn of the **Bṛhat** (**Sāma**), self-illuminating, strength-bestowing, and ascending to heaven; on which his allies, (the **Maruts**), combating for men, (guardians) of heaven, and vivifiers of mankind animated **Indra** (to destroy him).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sāma is added to bṛhat. The alusion is to Sāma, a verse of the Ṛk
