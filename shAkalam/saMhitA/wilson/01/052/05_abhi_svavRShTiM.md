## English translation:

“His allies, exhilarated (by libations), preceded him, warring against the withholder of the rain, as rivers rush down declivities. **Indra**, animated by the sacrificial food, broke through the defences of **Vala** as did **Trita** through the coverings (of the well).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Paridhīr iva **tritaḥ**: tritaḥ, triple or threefold;hence, 'as through triple coverings or defences'. A legend is: **Ekata**, **Dvita** and Trita were three men produced in water by **Agni**, for the purpose of removing or rubbing off the relics of an oblation of clarified butter (like three blades of sacred grass used to rub off. Another legend: Agni threw the cinders of burnt-offerings into water, whence arose Ekata, Dvita and Trita (called Āptyas or sons of water). Trita went to draw water from a well and fell into it; **Asuras** heaped coverings over the mouth of the well to prevent his escape, but he broke through them. Indra's breaking through the defences of Vala, the **asura** is compared to this exploit of Trita
