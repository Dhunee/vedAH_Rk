## English translation:

“Tha **Indra** whom in heaven the libations sprinkled on the sacred grass replenish, as the kindred rivers hastening to it fill the ocean; that Indra whom the **Maruts**, the driers up of moisture, who are unobstructed, and of undistorted forms, attended as auxiliaries at the death of **Vṛtra**.”
