## English translation:

“The **Maruts** worshipped you in this (encounter); all the gods in this engagement imitated you in exultation, when you had struck the face of **Vṛtra** with your angular and fatal (bolt).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Bhṛṣṭimatā vadhena, with the weapon that has angles; **Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa**: **vajra**, the thunderbolt of **Indra** has eight angles or blades, aṣṭaṣṛr vai **vajraḥ**
