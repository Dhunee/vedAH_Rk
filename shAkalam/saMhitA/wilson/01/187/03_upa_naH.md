## English translation:

“Come to us, **Pitā**, auspicious with auspicious aids; a source of delight;not unpalatable; a friend well respected, and having none (but agreeable properties).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Having none but agreeable properties: The text has advayāḥ, notbeing twofold, i.e. being of the property described alone;not comprisingany incompatible property; or, it may be an epithet of **sakhā**, a friend, one who does not differ in mind or act
