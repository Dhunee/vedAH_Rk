## English translation:

“Those (men), **Pitā**, (are the enjoyers of your bounty), who are your distributors, most sweet Pitā, (to others); they who are the relishers of your flavours, are as if they had stiff necks.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Tuvigrīvaḥ iva irate: tuvi = **bahu**,much, many; or, **pravṛddha**, enlarged; when people eat, they are dṛḍhāṅga, erect, firm; and when they are without food, the neck is bent, or bends down; or it may mean, that they are great eaters, as if they had many throats
