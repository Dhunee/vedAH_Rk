## English translation:

“And since we enjoy, **Soma**, your mixture with boiled milk or boiled barley; therefore, Body, do you grow fat.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Soma: The object addressed is now not food in genitive ral, but a modified form of the Soma; your mixture with boiled milk or boiled barley: gavāśiro yavāśiro = preparations of milk and barley, boiled; govikāra kṣīrādyāśrayaṇa dravyam and yavavikārāśryaṇa dravyam
