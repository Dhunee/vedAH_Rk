## English translation:

“**Agni**, the ever young and wise, the guardian of the dwelling (of the sacrificer), the bearer of offerings, whose mouth is (the vehicle) of oblations, is kindled by Agni.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Gṛhapati**: **pati** = **pālaka**, cherisher, protector; hence, Agni is portrayed here as the protector of the house of the **yajamāna**; kindled by fire: oblation is poured into **āhavanīya** fire, which can be taken from the household fire or produced by churning with sticks
