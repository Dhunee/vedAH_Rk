## English translation:

“Such, well-born **Maruts**, is your greatness, that your munificence is as long (continued) as the function of **Aditi**; and **Indra** does not exceed, by his own liberality, (the value of) that which you have bestowed upon the devout man (who worships you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aditer iva vratam, the act or obligation of Aditi, either the mother of the gods, or the earth
