## English translation:

“**Maruts**, in your arms, propitious to man, are many good things; on your breasts are golden (ornaments) brilliant and conspicuous; while garlands (hang) on your shoulders; sharp are (the edges of) your weapons; the Maruts have various decorations, as birds have (many-coloured) wings.”
