## English translation:

“(The offerers of oblations) have plural ced in this (**Agni**) the graceful honours (of the ceremony), and the two portions of clarified butter that are the two eyes (of the sacrifice); then the immortals come from heaven, and your bright flames, Agni, spread in all directions like rushing rivers, and the gods perceive it (and rejoice).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Two eyes: the allusion is to two portions of the clarified butter (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.6.2.1)
