## English translation:

“Inasmuch, **Agni**, as the pure (**Maruts**) worshipped you, (equally) pure, with clarified butter for three years, therefore they acquired names worthy (to be treated) at sacrifice, and, being regenerated obtained celestial bodies.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śucayaḥ = the pure; for the Maruts, seven plural tters are plural ced at the **Agnicayana** and invoked: idṛs', anyādṛs', tādṛs', pratidṛs', **mitaḥ**, sammitaḥ (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 2.1.2.10); as a consequence of this participation with Agni, they exchanged their perishable bodies for immortal bodies and obtained heaven; the Maruts, are, therefore, deified mortals, like the **Ṛbhus**
