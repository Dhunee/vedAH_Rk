## English translation:

“The seven pure rivers that flow from heaven (are directed, **Agni**, by you; by you, the priests), skilled in sacrifices, knew the doors of the (cave where) the treasure, (their cattle), were concealed for you **Saramā** discovered the abundant milk of the kine with which man, the progeny of **Manu**, still is nourished.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agni is added as the instrumental ument or agent. The sun, nourished by burnt-offerings, is enabled to send down the rain which supplies the rivers. **Aṅgirasas** recovered their cattle when carried off by **Vala** through the knowledge obtained by holy sacrifices. **Indra** sent Saramā on the search mission, when propitiated by oblations with fire. In all these incidents, Agni was the prime mover
