## English translation:

“Those who are to be worshipped, (the gods), inquiring between the expansive heaven and earth (for **Agni**), recited (hymns) dedicated to **Rudra**; the troop of mortal (**Maruts**), with (**Indra**), the shrer of half the oblation, knowing where Agni was hiding found him in his excellent retreat.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Dedicated to Rudra: Rudra is equated with Agni; the hymns to Agni are called Rudrīya, for Rudra is Agni: rudra-**agniḥ**; a legend is cited: during a battle between the gods and **asuras**, Agni carried off the wealth which the former had concealed; detecting theft, the gods pursued the thief, and forcibly recovered their treasure; Agni wept (arodīt) at the loss; thereafter he was called Rudra (**Taittirīya** **Saṃhitā** 1.5.1.1); the text has martaḥ, the mortal; the term, **marudgaṇa** is added;

Nemadhitā = half-sharer, from **nema**, a half; Indra is entitled to all sacrifices; all the other gods get half the share: sarve **devāḥ** eko **ardhaḥ**, Indra eka evaparo ardhaḥ (Taittirīya 5.4.8.3)
