## English translation:

“**Agni**, holding in his **hands** many good things for men, appropriates the prayers addressed to the eternal creator. Agni is the lord of riches, quickly bestowing (on those who praise him) all golden (gifts).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Svatmabhimukham **karoti**, he makes them present or applicable to himself;

**Śaśvata** = **vedhas** or **brahmā**, creator, the eternal; an apparent indication of the identification of the first cause, identified with, yet distinct from Agni and other elemental deities
