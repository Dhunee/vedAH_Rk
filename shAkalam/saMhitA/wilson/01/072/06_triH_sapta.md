## English translation:

“(Devout men), competent to offer sacrifices, have known the thrice seven mystic rites comprised in you, and with them, worshipped you; do you, therefore, with like affection, protect their cattle, and all that (belongs to them), moveable or stationary.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Gṛhyāṇi padā (ni): secret or mysterious steps by which heaven is said to be obtained. Ceremonies of **vedas** (all involving **Agni**) are in three classes, each class has seven **yajñas**: **pāka-yajñas**, those in which food of some kind is offered (**aupāsana**, **homa**, **vaiśvadeva**); **havir-yajñas**, those in which clarified butter is offered (**agnyādheya**, **darśa pūrṇamāsa**); and **soma-yajñas**, the principal part of which is the libation of **soma** (**agniṣṭoma**, **atyagniṣṭoma**)
