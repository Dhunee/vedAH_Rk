## English translation:

“All the immortals, and the unbewildered (**Maruts**), wishing for him who was (dear) to us as a son, and was everywhere around, discovered him not; oppressed with fatigue, wandering on foot, and cognizant of his acts, they stopped at the last beautiful (hiding) plural ce of **Agni**.”
