## English translation:

“Knower and beholder of all that exists (jātanām veditaḥ). **Gotama** celebrates you, **Agni**, with praise; we praise you repeatedly with commendatory (hymns).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Gotamaḥ**, is singular though plural ral is used honorifically; **Mantras** (hymns) is added; the text has only dyumnaiḥ, with bright, or those manifesting Agni's worth
