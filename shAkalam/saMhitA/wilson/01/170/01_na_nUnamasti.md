## English translation:

“(**Indra** speaks): It is not certain what today or what tomorrow will yield to us; who comprehends this mystery; verily, the mind of any other (being) is of an unsteady (nature), and even that which has been profoundly studied, is (in time) forgotten.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This **sūkta** is related to a olegend: **Agastya**, intended to offer a sacrifice to Indra; he proposed to make offerings also to the **Maruts**; Indra complained about this. This is an apparent allusion to the objections by worshippers of Indra about the inclusion of offerings to Maruts. It is not certain what today: na nūnam **asti** no śvaḥ = liṭ, it is not certain, nor is it tomorrow; the explanation: it is not certain, Indra says, wherther I shall receive any offering either today or tomorrow; verily the mind of any other: anyasya cittam abhisañcareṇyam utādhitam vinaśyati = liṭ, the mind of another is very wandering; although read, (it) perishes
