## English translation:

“(**Agastya**): Let the priests decorate the altar; let them kindle the fire to the east; and then let us both consummate the sacrifice, the inspirerof immortal (wisdom).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The hymn is also attributed to **Indra**; let us both: the two are either the sacrificer and his wife, or the instrumental tutor of the ceremony and the officiating priest
