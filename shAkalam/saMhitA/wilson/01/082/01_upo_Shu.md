## English translation:

“Approach, **Maghavan**, and listen to our praises; be not different (from what you have hitherto been) since you have inspired us with true speech, you are solicited with it; therefore, quickly yoke your horses.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Māatathā iva, (be) not, as it were, non-such; i.e. be not the contrary of what propitious divinity which you have always been to us; 'since you make us possessed of true speech (sunṛtāvataḥ), therefore you are asked (at arthayasa it) arthayase eva', i.t. to accept our praises
