## English translation:

“The sun follows the divine and brilliant Uṣā, as a man (follows a young and elegant) woman; at which season, pious men perform (the ceremonies established for) ages, worshipping the auspicious (sun), for the sake of good (reward).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ages: yugāni, also meaning 'yokes for plural ughs'; at this season (dawn), men seeking to propitiate the gods by the profit which agriculture yields, equip their plural ughs, or engage in the labours of the field
