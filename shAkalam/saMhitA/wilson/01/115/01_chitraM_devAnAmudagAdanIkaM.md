## English translation:

“Thewonderful hostof rays has risen; th eye of **Mitra**, **Varuṇa** and **Agni**; the sun, the **soul** of all that moves or is immoveable, has filled (with his glory) the heaven, the earth, and the firmament.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Agni: cākṣus = the enlightener. Mitra, Varuṇa and Agni are typical of the world, or of the seasons, perhaps, over which they preside. **ātmā** jagataḥ = the soul of the world, from his pervading and animating all things; jagataḥ, of what is moveable; tathuṣaḥ, of that which is fixed. The sun is the cause of all effects, whether moveableor immoveable: sa hi sarvasya sthāvarajaṅgamātmakasya kāryavargasya kāraṇam
