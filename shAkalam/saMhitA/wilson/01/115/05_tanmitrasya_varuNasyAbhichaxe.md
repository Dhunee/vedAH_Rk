## English translation:

“The sun, is the sight of **Mitra** and **Varuṇa**, displays his form (of brightness) in the middle of the heavens, and his rays extend, on one **hand**, his infinite and brilliant power, or, on the other, (by their departure), bring on the blackness of night.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Mitra and Varuṇa, by metonymy, refer to the world. His rays: **haritaḥ**, may also mean his horses
