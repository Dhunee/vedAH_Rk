## English translation:

“One pours the red water (the blood) upon the ground; one cuts the flesh, divided into fragments by the chopper; and a third seperates the excrement from the other parts; in what manner may the parents (of the sacrifice) render assistance to their sons?”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The **Ṛbhus** are identified with the priests employed in the sacrifice of a victim; the parents of the sacrifice: the parents **pitṛs**, = the instrumental tutor of the ceremony and his wife
