## English translation:

“They, (the gods), have said, sons of **Sudhanvan**, drink of this water, (the **Soma**); or drink that which has been filtered through the **muñja** grass; or, if you be plural ased with neither of these, be exhilarated (by that which is drunk) at the third (daily) sacrifice.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ṛbhus** may be participants of the libations offered at dawn or at noon; the right of the Ṛbhus to share in the third, or evening sacrifice is always acknowledged
