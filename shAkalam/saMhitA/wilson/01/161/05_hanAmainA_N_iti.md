## English translation:

“When **Tvaṣṭā** said: let us slay those who have profaned the ladle, (designed) for the drinking of the gods; then they made use of other names for one another as the libation was poured out; and the maiden (mother) propitiated them by different appellations.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Then they made us of other names: a legend accounts for the origin of the names of the chief officiating priests; to evade the indignation of Tvaṣṭā, the **Ṛbhus** assumed the titles: **adhvaryu**, **hotā** and **udgatā**;an individual engaged in priestly functions at a sacrifice is to be always addressed by these titles, and never by his own name; propitiated themby different appellations: anyair enān **kanyā** nāmabhiḥ sparat: kanyā = svotpādayitrī **mātā**, a mother self-engendering
