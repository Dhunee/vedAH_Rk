## English translation:

“**Ṛbhus**, reposing in the solar orb, you inquire: who awakens us, unapprehensive (Sun), to this office (of sending rain). The Sun replies: the awakener is the wind; and the year (being ended), you again today light up this (world).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The awakener is the wind: śvānam bodhayitāram = the awakener is the dog; but, śvānam = antarkṣe svasantam vāyum, the reposer in the firmament, the wind; saṃvatsare idam **adyā** vyakhyata, you have made this world today luminous, after the year has expired; i.e. the rainy season has passed, the rays of the sun and moon are again visible
