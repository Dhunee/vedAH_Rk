## English translation:

“**Ṛbhus**, leaders (of the rains), you have caused the grass to grow upon the high plural ces; you have caused the waters to flow over the low plural ces; for (the promotion of) good works; as you have reposed for a while in the dwelling of the unapprehensible (Sun), so desist not today from (the discharge of) this (your function).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhus are identified in this and following hymns with the rays of the sun, as the instrumental uments of the rain and the causes of fertility; ādityaraśmayo api **ṛbhava** ucyante: (**Nirukta** 11.16); unapprehensible Sun: agohyasya gṛhe: agohya = a name of the sun (Nirukta); who is not to be hidden, aguhanīya;or, agrahaṇīya, not to be apprehended, literally or metaphorically; so desist not: idam nānugacchatha; anusṛtya na gacchatha, having come forth, go not away without doing this,idam, your office of sending down rain for as long a period as you repose in the solar orb; a truism is explained in Nirukta: yāvat tatra bhavatha na tāvadiha bhavatha, as long as you are there, you are not here
