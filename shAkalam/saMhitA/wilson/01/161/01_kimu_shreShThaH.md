## English translation:

“Is this our senior or our junior who has come (to us); has he come upon a message (from the gods); what is it we should say? **Agni**,brother, we revile not the ladle which is of exalted race; verily we assert the dignity of the wooden (implement).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The legend: the three **Ṛbhus** were engaged in a sacrifice and about to drink the **Soma**; the gods sent Agni to see what they were doing. Agni noticed that they resembled each other; Agni assumed a like form. The hymn refers to this form, calling himbrother, and questionign his comparative age. The next hymn states the purpose of Agni's visit is to order the conversion of one spoon or ladle, **camasa**, used for drinking Soma, or for libations, into four spoons
