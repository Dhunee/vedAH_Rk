## English translation:

“As you glide along enveloping the regions (in clouds); where, then, are the parents (of the world)? curse him who arrests your arm; reply sternly to him who speaks disrespectfully (to you).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The parents of the world: the sun and the moon, the protectors of the world, which, during the rains, are hidden by the clouds; who speaks disrespectfully: yaḥ prābravīt pra tasmā abravītana: pra prefixed to brū = either to speak harshly or kindly, to censure or to praise
