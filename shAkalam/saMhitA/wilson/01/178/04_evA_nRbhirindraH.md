## English translation:

“Verily, **Indra** through desire of (sacrificial) food, is the devourer (of that which is presented) by (his) worshippers, and overcomes (the adversaries) of his friend; in the many-voiced assembly (of men), Indra, the faithful (performer of his promise), commending (the piety) of his worshipper, approves of the (offered) food.”
