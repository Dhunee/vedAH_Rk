## English translation:

“**Indra**, the hero, the victor in battles, along with the leaders (of his hosts, the **Maruts**), will hear the invocation of his supplicating worshipper, and when disposed to accept his praises, will, of his own accord, drive his chariot close to the donor (of the oblation).”
