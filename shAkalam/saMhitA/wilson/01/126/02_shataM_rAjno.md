## English translation:

“From which genitive rous prince, soliciting (my acceptance), I, **Kakṣīvat**, unhesitatingly accepted a hundred **niṣkas**, a hundred vigorous steeds, and a hundred bulls, whereby he has spread his imperishable fame through heaven.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Niṣka** = a weight of gold = four **suvarṇa** (**Manu**. viii.134); = 108 **suvarṇas** (**Amarakośa**)
