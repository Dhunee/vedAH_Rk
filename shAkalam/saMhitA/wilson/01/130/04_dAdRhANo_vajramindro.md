## English translation:

“Grasping his sharp thunderbolt with both **hands**, **Indra** whetted it to hurl it (on his foes), like the water (of an imprecation); he whetted it for the destruction of Ahi. Indra, who are fully endowed with strength, with energy, with might, you cut (our enemies) to pieces, as a wood-cutter the trees of a forest; you cut them to pieces as if with a hatcheṭ”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Like the water of an imprecation: udakam yathā śatrūṇām nirasnāya abhyimantraṇādi saṃskāreṇa tikṣnīkṛyate = that is, like water which is poured out for the destruction of enemies, rendered fatal by the formula of imprecation
