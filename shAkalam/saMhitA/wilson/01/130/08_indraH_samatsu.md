## English translation:

“**Indra**, the manifold protector (of his worship) battles, defends his **Ārya** worshipper in all conflicts, in conflicts that confer heaven; he punished for (the benefit of) man the neglecters of religious rites; he tore off the black skin (of the aggressor); as if burning (with flame), he consumes the malignant; he utterly consumes him who delights in cruelty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The black skin: The legens is that an **asura**, named **Kṛṣṇa** the black, advanced with ten thousand followers to the banks of the **Aṃśumati** river, where he committed fearful devastation until Indra, with the **Maruts**, was sent against him by **Bṛhaspati**, when he was defeated by Indra, and stripped of his skin
