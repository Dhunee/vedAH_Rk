## English translation:

“You have without effort created the river (that are) to flow to the sea, like chariots (bearing you to sacrifices), as those (construct) chariots who are desirous of (going to) battle; (the streams) flowing hither have gathered together their water for a common purpose, like the cows that yielded all things to **Manu**; that yield all things to man.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Without effort: **vṛthā** = fruitlessly, in vain; or, apryatnena, without effort
