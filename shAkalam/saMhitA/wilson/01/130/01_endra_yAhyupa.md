## English translation:

“Come to us, **Indra**, from afar; not as this (fire) which is before us, (but) like the pious instrumental tutor of sacrifices, or like the royal lord of the constellations (when going) to his setting. Bearing oblations, we, along with (the priests), invoke you to accept the effused (**Soma**), as sons (invite) a father to partake of food; (we invoke) you, who are most entitled to reverence, to (accept of) the sacrificial viands.”
