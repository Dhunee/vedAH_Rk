## English translation:

“Endowed with augmented vigour, he hurled (aginst the foes) the wheel (of the chariot) of the sun; and, ruddy of hue, deprived them of existence; he, the sovereign lord, deprived them of existence. As you, sage **Indra**, come from afar to the succour of **Uśanā**, so do you come quickly, bearing all good things (to us) every day.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sūraścakram pravṛhad = he threw the sun's wheel; sūryasya rathasya cakram, the wheel of the chariot of the sun: the legend is that the **asuras** obtained a boon from **Brahmā**, that they should not be destroyed by the thunderbolt of Indra, and having in consequence defied him, he cast at them the wheel of the sun's car, which was equally fatal. Another legend: the sun (of Indra) having risen, urges on his car, and **Aruṇa** (his charioteer) silences the clamour (of his enemies); the lord (of day) dissipates the gloom. Deprives them of existence: vācam muṣāyati = lit. steals or takes away speech; speech is a metonymy for breath, i.e. life; or, it may mean, silence clamour or suppress his own exclamation
