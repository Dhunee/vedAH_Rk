## English translation:

“Drink, **Indra**, the **Soma**, that has been expressed by the stones, and spinkled with the sacred grass; as a thirsty ox or a thirsty man hastens to a well. (Drink) fo ryour exhilaration, for your invogoration, for your exceedingly great augmentation; let your horses bring you hither, as his steeds convey the sun; as they carry him (through heaven) day by day.”
