## English translation:

“Men who are desirous of wealth have recited this your praise, as a resolute and provident man (prepares) a chariot (for a journey); they have propitiated you for their good; glorifying you, sage **Indra**, as impetuous in conflicts, they have praised you (as men praise) a conqueror. We praise you for (the acquisition of) strength, wealth, and every kind of affluence; as (they command) a courser (for his good qualities) in battle.”
