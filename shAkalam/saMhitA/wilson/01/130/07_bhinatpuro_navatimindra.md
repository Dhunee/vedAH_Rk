## English translation:

“For Pur, the giver of offerings, for the mighty **Divodāsa**, you, **Indra**, the dancer (with delight in battle), have destroyed ninety cities; dancer (in battle), you have destroyed them with (your thunderbolt), for (the sake of) the giver of offerings. For (the sake of) **Atithigva**, the fierce (indra) hurled **Śambara** from off the mountain bestowing (uon the prince) immense treasure, (acquired) by (his) prowess; all kinds of wealth (acquired) by (his) prowess.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Nṛto = voc.of nṛtu, a dancer; raṇe nartanaśīla, dancing in war; Śambara is an **asura** who was engaged in hostilities with **Kṛṣṇa**, and finally destroyed, together with his six hundred sons, by **Pradyumna**, the grandson of Kṛṣṇa (cf. **Harivamśa**, Langlois, vol. iii, p. 169). Mah_bhārata represents Śambara as an adversary of Indra, in **Droṇa**-**vijaya**
