## English translation:

“He (**Indra**) found the (**Soma**) treasure (that had been brought) from heaven, and hidden like the nestlings of a bird in a rock; amidst (a pile of) vast rocks enclosed (by bushes); desiring to partake (of the beverage), the thunderer (found it), as the chief of the **Aṅgirasas** (discovered) the hiding-plural ce of the cows; he opened the doors of (the waters, the sources of) food, when **shut** up (in the clouds, the sources of) food, that were spread (over the earth).”
