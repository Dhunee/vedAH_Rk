## English translation:

“Dissolve not, **Agni**, our ancestral friendship, for you are cognizant of the past as well as of the present; in like manner as light (speeds over) the sky, so decay impairs (my body); think of me before that source of destruction (prevails).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Amṛtatvam prayacchati yāvat, asking Agni, therefore, to grant immortality
