## English translation:

“When (the worshipper) kindles you in his own dwelling, and presents an oblation to you, daily desiring it, do you, **Agni**, augmented in two ways, (as middling and as best), increase his means of sustenance; may he whom you sen dwith his car to battle, return with wealth.”
