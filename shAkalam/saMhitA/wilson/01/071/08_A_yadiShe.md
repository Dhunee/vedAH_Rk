## English translation:

“May that (digestive) faculty (of **Agni**) with regards food, be imparted to the devout and illustrious protector of priests, as the source of virile vigour; and may Agni be born as (his) robust, irreproachable, youthful and intelligent son, and instrumental gate him (to acts of worship).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Retas** = water; hence, 'may fire and water, or heat and moister, be spread through the earth for the genitive ration of corn' is an alternative rendering
