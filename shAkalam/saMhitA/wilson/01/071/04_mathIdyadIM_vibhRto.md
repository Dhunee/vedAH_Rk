## English translation:

“When the diffusive vital air excites **Agni**, he becomes bright and manifest in every mansion, and the instrumental tutor of the rite, imitating **Bhṛgu**, prevails on him to perform the function of messenger, as a prince who has become a friend sends an ambassador to his more powerful (conqueror).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Mātariśvan** = **vāyu**; here, it means, principal vital air, mukhyaprāṇa; the legend about the dialogue amongst the five divided (**vibhṛta**) airs: 'To them said the **Ariṣṭa** breaths: Be not astonished, for, I, having made myself five-fold, and having arrested the arrow, sustain (life)';

Jenya = from **jana**, to be born; or, from ji, to conquer;

Legend: 'the gods and **asuras** were once engaged in combat; the former, being alarmed, entered into fire, therefore they call agni all the gods, who having made him their shield, overcame the asuras' (**Taittirīya** Samhitā 6.2.2.6-7); 'the gods having awoke agni and plural ced him before them at the morning sacrifice, repulsed, with him in their van, the asuras and **rākṣasas** at the morning rite' (**Aitareya** **Brāhmaṇa** 6.4)
