## English translation:

“Our forefathers, the **Aṅgirasas**, by their praises (of **Agni**), terrified the strong and daring devourer, (**Paṇi**), by the sound; they made for us a path to the vast heaven, and obtained accessible day, the ensign of day, (**Āditya**) and the cows (that had been stolen).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ketu** = indicator or cause of day being known; Āditya, the sun
