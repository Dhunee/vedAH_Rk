## English translation:

“They secured hi, (**Agni**, in the sacrificial chamber), they made his worship the source of wealth; whence opulent votaries preserve his fires and practise his rites. Free from all (other) desire, assiduous in his adoration, and sustaining gods and men by their offerings, they come into his presence.”
