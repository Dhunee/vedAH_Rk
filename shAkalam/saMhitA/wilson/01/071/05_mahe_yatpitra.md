## English translation:

“When (the worshipper) offers an oblation to his great and illustrious protector, the grasping (**rākṣas**), recognizing you, **Agni**, retires; but Agni, the archer, sends after him a blazing arrow from his dreadful bow, and the god bestows light upon his own daughter (the dawn).”
