## English translation:

“For you this **Soma**, purified by the stones (that bruise), and clothed with enviable (splendour), flows to its (appropriate) receptacle; clothed with brilliant (splendour), this Soma is offered as your portion amongst men and amongst gods; (having received it), harness your horses, and depart well effected towards us; gratified, and well disposed towards us, depart.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Paripūto adribhiḥ = abhiṣavaśādhanair apagatarjīśodhitaḥ, purified by the impurity which has been removed by the purifying means of the effusion;

Ṛjiṣa = gatasaraḥ soma, i.e. soma that has lost its strength; daśāpavitraśodhanena grahaṇena vā śodhitaḥ = purified by straining through **kuśa** grass, or by taking hold of; spārhā **vasānaḥ** = sprhaṇīyāni tejāṃsi pidhānaḥ, putting on desirable or enviable splendours; **pari** kośam arṣati = **kośa**-sthānīyam grahamprāpnoti, it goes to the ladle, as it were, in plural ce of a receptacle
