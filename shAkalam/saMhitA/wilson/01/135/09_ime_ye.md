## English translation:

“These your horses, excellent **Vāyu**, strong of limb, youthful and full of vigour, bear you through the space between heaven and earth; growing (are they) in bulk, and strong as oxen; they are not lost in the firmament, but hold on their speed, unretarded by reviling; difficult are they to be arrested as the beams of the sun; difficult are they to be arrested by force.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Unretarded by reviling: agiraukasaḥ = lit. having no dweling by speech; i.e. they are not brought to a stop by abusive speech of the like, bhartsnādinā sthitim alabhamānāḥ; hastayor dur-niyantavaḥ, difficult to be checked by both **hands**, or by physical force; they are not to be deterred by words, such as voḥ voḥ; or by pulling up the rains, from coming to the sacrifice
