## English translation:

“The pious acts (addressed) to you have given augmented (efficacy) to our sacrifices; for you, (the priests) strain this quick-dropping **Soma**, as (the grooms rub down) a fleet, quick-running courser; drink of their (libations), and come hither, well disposed towards us, for our protection; do you both drink of the Soma that have been expressed by the stones, for you are both givers of food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

As the grooms rub down: the intended verb is: marmṛjanta, have strained or cleaned, or rubbed; vājinam, āśumatyam na vājinam = lit. going quick, like a quick horse, going quick
