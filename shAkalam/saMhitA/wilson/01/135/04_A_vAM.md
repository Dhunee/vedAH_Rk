## English translation:

“Let the chariot drawn by the **Niyuts** convey you both, (**Indra** and **Vāyu**, to the sacrifice), for our preservation, and to partake of the consecrated viands; to partake, Vāyu, of the oblations; drink of the sweet beverage;for the first draught is your (joing) due. Vāyu (and Indra), come with joy-bestowing wealth; Indra (and Vāyu), come with wealth.”
