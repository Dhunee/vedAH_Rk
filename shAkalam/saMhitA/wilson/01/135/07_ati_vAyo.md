## English translation:

“Pass, (**Vāyu**), by the many sleeping (worshippers) and go (with **Indra**) to the house where the stone resounds; Indra (and Vāyu), go to that dwelling; (go where) the (word of) truth is manifest; (go where) the butter flows; go both well-fed horses to the sacrifice; Indra (and Vāyu), repair to the sacrifice.”
