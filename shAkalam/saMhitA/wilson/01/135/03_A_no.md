## English translation:

“Come with hundreds and thousand of your steeds to our sacrifice to partake of (the sacrificial) food; (come), **Vāyu**, to partake of the oblations; this is your reasonable portion, and it is radiant along with the sun; the **Soma** (portions) borne by the priests are prepared; the pure Soma (portions), Vāyu, are prepared.”
