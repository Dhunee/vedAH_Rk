## English translation:

“Then, accept the libations of the sweet **Soma** at the sacrifice in which the triumphant priests stand round the rock-born (plural nt); may they ever be victorious for us; (for you) together the cows distil (their milk); the (offering of) barley is dressed; and never for you, (**Vāyu**), will the cows grow meagre. never will the kine be carried off (by thieves).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Aśvattham upatiṣṭhanti: **aśvattha** = the religious fig tree; explained here as the Soma found spread through mountains and the like, parvatādi vyātipradeśe sthitam; na upadasyanti dhenavaḥ-nāpa dasyanti dhenavaḥ: **upadas** = infirm, or wasted by sickness;

**Apadas** = to be carried off by thieves
