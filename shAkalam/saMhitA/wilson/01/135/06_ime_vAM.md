## English translation:

“These **Soma**, poured out in our rites, and borne by the priests, are prepared for you both; the pure Soma, **Vāyu** (and **Indra**), are prepared; these pervading (effusions) have passed through the oblique filter for you both; the Soma intended for you both, pass through the woolly fleece; the inexhaustible soma.”
