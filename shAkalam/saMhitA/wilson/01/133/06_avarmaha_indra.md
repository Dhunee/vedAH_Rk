## English translation:

“Hurl headlong, **Indra**, the vast (cloud); hear our supplications; verily the heaven is in sorrow like the earth, through fear, wielder of the thunderbolt, (of famine), as (formerly through fear of) **Tvaṣṭā**; most powerful withmighty energies, you assail, Indra, (the clouds) with terrible blows; and, doing no injury to man (you march) invincible, hero, by (your) enemies attended, hero, by three or by seven followers.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Of famine = from the absence of rain;

Tvaṣṭā: ghṛṇān-na bhīṣa: ghṛṇā is a name of Tvaṣṭā, or of blazing fire person nified;

Legend: the world being enveloped by thick darkness, the gods prayed to **Agni**, on which he burst forth suddenly from heaven and earth, in the shape of Tvaṣṭā, to the dismay of both regions: sa cobhe tvaṣṭur bibhyatuḥ; by three or by seven followers: trisaptaiḥ śūrasatvabhiḥ: tribhiḥ saptabhir vā anucaraiḥ. An allusion perhaps to the seven plural tters offered to the **Maruts**
