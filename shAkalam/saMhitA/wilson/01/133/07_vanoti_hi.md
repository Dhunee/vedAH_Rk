## English translation:

“Offering libations, (the worshipper) obtains a (safe) asylum; offering libations, he destroys his prostrate foes; (he destroys) the enemies of the gods; abounding with food, and unsubdued (by adversaries), he hopes to attain, when offering libations, infinite (riches), for **Indra** grants to him who offers libations whatever there is (that he desires); he grants (him) accusative ulated wealth.”
