## English translation:

“By sacriice I purify both the heaven and the earth; I burn the wide (realms of earth) that are without **Indra**, and are (the haunts) of the wicked; wherever the enemies have congregated they have been slain; and, utterly destroyed, they sleep in a deep pit.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vailasthānam aśeran = they have slept; or, they sleep in a plural ce which is of the nature of **a vila**, a hole, a cavern, a pit; equivalent to **smaśāna**, a plural ce where dead bodies are burned, or, a plural ce where they are buried (tatra śavāḥ kṣipyante iti vailasthānam śmaśānam);

Alternative: vailasthānam = **nāgaloka**, the serpent-world; **pātāla**, the regions below the earth
