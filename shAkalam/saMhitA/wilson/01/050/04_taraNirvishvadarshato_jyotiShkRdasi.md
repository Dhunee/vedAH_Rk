## English translation:

“You, **Sūrya**, outstrip all in speed; you are visible to all; you are the source of light; you shine throughout the entire firmament.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Smṛti** states that the sun moves 2,202 **yojanas** in a half a winkle of the eye;

Jyotiṣkṛt = giving light to all things, even to the moon and the plural nets, by night; for, they are of a watery substance from which the rays of the sun are reflected (like a mirror in a door-way reflecting sun's rays, to light up a chamber); metaphysical explanation: sun is the **supreme spirit**, who enables all beings to pass over the ocean of existence, who is beheld by all desiring final emancipation, who authors true light, and who illuminates everything through the light of the mind
