## English translation:

“The Sun has yoked the seven mares that safely draw his chariot, and comes with them self-harnessed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sapta śundhyuvaḥ; **aśva**-stṛyaḥ = mares; they are also naptyaḥ, since the car does not fall because of them, yābhir na patati **rathaḥ**
