## English translation:

“Radiant with benevolent light, rising today and mountina into the highest heaven, do you O Sun, remove sickness of my heart, and the yellowness (of my body).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Hrḍ-**roga** = heart-burn or indigestion;

Harimāṇam = greenness (caused by bilious afflictions). Praśkaṇva was reportedly cured of leprosy or a cutaneous malady, with this praise of **Sūrya**; **Śaunaka** treats this as a **mantra** dedicated to the Sun to remove sin, heal disease, be an antidote to poison and as a means of obtaining present happiness and final liberation
