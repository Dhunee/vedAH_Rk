## English translation:

“Beholding the up-springing light above the darkness, we approach the divine Sun among the gods, the excellent light.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

An allusion to the spiritual sun: darkness connotes sin; approach to the sun is a reunion with the **supreme spirit**; aganma jyotiruttamam, we go to the best light, i.e. we become one with the spiritual light, sāyujyam gacchāmaḥ; tam yathā yathopāsate tad eva **bhavati**, he (the worshipper) becomes identical with that which he worships
