## English translation:

“He, who is, as it were, the genitive rator of men as well as of heaven and earth, of whom creation has imbibed life, abides with his glories; he it is who, entering into the womb (of being), procreates (all living creatures).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Who procreates all living creatures: **Agni** presents to the Sun the oblations offered with fire;thus Agni is identified with solar rays, engenders rain, on which the food and consequent existence of all living beings depends; of whom, therefore, Agni may be said to be the begetter
