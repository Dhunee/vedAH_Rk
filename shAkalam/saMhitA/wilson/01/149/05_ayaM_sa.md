## English translation:

“He is the offerer of oblations, who is of twofold birth; and, through desire of (sacrificial) food, has in his keeping all good things; the man who presents offerings to him is the parent of excellent offspring.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

At the plural ce where waters are: apām sadasthe, the plural ce of sacrifice where water is collected for the different purificatory sprinklings required; or, it might refer to the **antarikṣa**, or firmament, in which **Agni** exists as lightning. This and the preceding hymn appear in **Sāmaveda** and explained by Benfey: 'he who illumes the plural ce the cheerful, (who is) the wise, the swift, like a horse, springing in the air like a bright sun full of life'; 'The twofold born abides, illuming with his radiance the three bright regions, all the world, the most sacred priest in the realm of the waters'
