## English translation:

“Your, wielder of the thunderbolt, did open the cave of **Vala**, who had there concealed the cattle; and the gods whom he had oppressed, no longer feared when they had obtained you (for their ally).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Vala was an **asura**; he stole the cows of the gods and hid them in a cave; **Indra** recovered the cattle after surrounding the cave with his army. **Paṇis**, also cow-stealers, werre the soldiers of Vala (Anukramaṇikā)
