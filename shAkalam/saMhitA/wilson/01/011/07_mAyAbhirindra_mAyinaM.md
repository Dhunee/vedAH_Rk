## English translation:

“Your slewest, **Indra**, by stratagems, the wily **Śuṣṇa**; the wise have known of this your (greatness); bestow upon them (abundant) food.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Śuṣṇa is an **asura** slain by Indra. Śuṣṇa = dryer up; bhutānām **śoṣaṇa**-hetum, the cause of the drying or withering of beings: heat or draught; Indra, as the rain puts an end to this; **indraḥ** śuṣṇum jaghāna (**Nirukta**. 3.11)
