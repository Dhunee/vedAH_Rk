## English translation:

“Ask (of **Agni** what you desire), for he goes (everywhere), he knows (all things); possessed of intelligence, he proceeds (to ascertain what is to be done), and is had recourse to (by his worshippers); for in him is the power of restraining (unreasonable desires) in him (is the power of granting) enjoyment; he is the giver of food and of strength; the protector of the mighty.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

He proceeds: the text has only iyate and nviyate,he goes, and goes quickly, or is gone to or worshipped; the verb, with a passive signification is added: sevyate; in him is the power of granting enjoyment: tasmin-t-**santi** praśiṣaḥ tasminniṣṭayaḥ: praśiṣa = praśāsanāni or niyamanasāmarthyam, power of restraining; i.e., having restrained what is not to be accomplished, he is able to accomplish what may be effected;

**Iṣṭi** = sacrifice; here it is interpreted as **bhogaḥ** = enjoyments, or those acts of worship which confer rewards
