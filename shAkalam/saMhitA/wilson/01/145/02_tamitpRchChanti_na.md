## English translation:

“They ask of **Agni**, but no one asks improperly; for a sensible man (replies to solicitation) as he has determined in his own mind; Agni tolerates not a speech that anticipates (his reply), nor endures a rejoinder; he who is devoid of arrogance is favoured by his protection.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Na mṛṣyate prathamam nāparam **vacas** = lit. he does not bear a first or a subsequent speech; i.e. nor endures a rejoinder
