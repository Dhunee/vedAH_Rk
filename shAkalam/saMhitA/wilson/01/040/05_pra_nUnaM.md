## English translation:

“Verily **Brahmaṇaspati** proclaims the sacred prayer, in which the divinities, **Indra**, **Varuṇa**, **Mitra** and **Aryaman**, have made their abode.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

This and the next verse are to be recited at **Agniṣṭoma** as prayers to Indra and the **Maruts**. **Hotā** recites the prayer (**mantra**) aloud (pravadati), by the mouth (**ukthya**); in the mantra, Indra and the other **devās** rest. The next verse explains how the mantra brings them to the presence of the worshipper: indrādi-sarvadevatāpratipādakam mantram
