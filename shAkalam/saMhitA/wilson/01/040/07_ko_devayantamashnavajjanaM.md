## English translation:

“Who, (except **Brahmaṇaspati**), may approach the man who is devoted to the gods, by whom the clipped sacred grass is spread; the giver of the oblation has proceeded with the priests (to the hall of sacrifice), for he has a dwelling (abounding) internally with precious things.”
