## English translation:

“May **Brahmaṇaspati** approach us; may the goddess, speaker of truth, approach us; may the gods (drive away) every adversary, and present, conduct us to the sacrifice which is beneficial to man, and (abounds) with respectably-presented offerings.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Devi** sunṛtā = goddess of speech or vāk **devatā**; she is priyasatyarūpa, lover of truth, a form of **Sarasvatī**
