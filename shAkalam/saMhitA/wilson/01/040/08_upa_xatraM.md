## English translation:

“Let **Brahmaṇaspati** concentrate his strength associated with the regal (divinities), he slays (the foe); in the time of danger he maintains his station; armed with the thunderbolt, there is no encourager nor discourager of him in a great battle or a small.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The thunderbolt identifies **Indra**
