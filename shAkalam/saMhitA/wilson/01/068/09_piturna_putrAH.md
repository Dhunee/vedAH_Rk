## English translation:

“\[9-10\] Hastening to obey the commands of **Agni**, like sons (obedient of the orders) of a father, they celebrate his worship; abounding in food, Agni sets open before them treasures that are the doorf of sacrifice; and he who delights in the sacrificial chamber has studded the sky with constellations.”
