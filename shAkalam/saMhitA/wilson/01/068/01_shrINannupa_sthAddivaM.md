## English translation:

“\[1-2\] The bearer (of the oblations), **Agni**, mixing them (with other ingredients), ascends to heaven, and clothes all things, moveable and immoveable, and the nights themselves, (with light), radiant amongst the gods, and in himself alone comprehending the virtues of all these (substances).”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Comprehending the virtues of all these: alternative, 'he alone surpasses the glories (mahitva) of all these gods'
