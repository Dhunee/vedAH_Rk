## English translation:

“\[7-8\] You have abided with the descendants of **Manu** as the invoker (of the gods); you are indeed the lord of their possessions; they have desired (of you) procreative vigour in their bodies, and, associated with their own excellent offspring, they contemplate (all things) undisturbed.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Descendants of Manu: mankind
