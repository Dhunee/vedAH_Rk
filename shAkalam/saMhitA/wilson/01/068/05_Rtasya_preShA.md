## English translation:

“\[5-6\] Praises are addressed to him who has repaired (to the solemnity); oblations (are offered) to him who has gone (to the sacrifice); in him is all sustenance, (and to him) have all (devout person ns) performed (the customary) rites. Do you, **Agni**, knowing (the thoughts of the worshipper), grant riches to him who presents to you oblations, or who wishes (to be able to present them).”
