## English translation:

“Come, **Aśvins**, with your three-columned triangular car; the **Kaṇvas** repeat your praise at the sacrifice; graciously hear their invocation.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Trivandhureṇa **trivṛta** rathenā, with a car with three **posts** and triangular is an earlier explanation; in the context of this hymn, the rendering is: having three undulating fastenings of timber, and passing unobstructedly through the **three worlds**
