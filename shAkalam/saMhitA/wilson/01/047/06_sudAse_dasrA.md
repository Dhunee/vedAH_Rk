## English translation:

“Good-looking **Aśvins**, as you brought in your car, bearers of wealth, abundance to **Sudās**, so bring to us in the riches that many covet, whether from the firmament or the sky beyond.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Sudās is a **rāja**, son of Pījavana. Two Sudās are attested; one **Sudāsa** is of the solar line (**Viṣṇu Purāṇa**, 380); another is of the lunar line, son of **Divodāsa** (**Viṣṇu** **Purāṇa**, 454)
