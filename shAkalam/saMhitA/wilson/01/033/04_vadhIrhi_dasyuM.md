## English translation:

“Verily, **Indra**, you have slain the wealthy barbarian with your bold; your, singly assailing (him), although with auxiliaries (the **Maruts**) at **hand**. Perceiving the impending manifold destructiveness of your bow, they, the **Sanakas**, the neglecters of sacrifice, perished.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Barbarian: **Vṛtra**, the **Dasyu** (lit. a robber), in contrast to **Ārya**; vṛtrasya **antaḥ** sarve **devaḥ** sarvaśca **vidyaḥ** sarvāṇi haviṃṣi cāsan: he comprehends within him all gods, all knowledge, all o9blations;

Sanakas: followers of Vṛtra who are ayajvānaḥ, non-sacrificers
