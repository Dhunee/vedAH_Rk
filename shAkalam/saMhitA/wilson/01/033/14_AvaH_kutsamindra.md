## English translation:

“You, **Indra**, have protected **Kutsa**, grateful for his praises; you have defended the excellent **Daśadyu** engaged in battle; the dust of your courser's hoofs ascended to heaven; the son of Śvita, (through your favour), rose up, to be again unborn by men.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kutsa is a ṛṣi, a founder of a **gotra**, a religious family; **Daśadyuḥ** is also a ṛṣi and a warrior; **Śvaitreya** or **Śvitrya** is the son of mother **Śvitra**. Next hymn described Śvitra as having hidden himself in a pool of water to avoid the enemies
