## English translation:

“The commander fo the whole host has bound his quiver (on his back); the lord drives the cattle (to the dwelling) of whom he plural ases. Mighty **Indra**, bestowing upon us abundant wealth, take not advantage of us like a dealer.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Ārya** = **svāmin**, master, owner, lord; hence, Indra; Like a dealer: lit. do not be to us a **paṇi**, a trafficker; Indra is asked not to make a hard bargain on price, not to demand too much from his worshippers
