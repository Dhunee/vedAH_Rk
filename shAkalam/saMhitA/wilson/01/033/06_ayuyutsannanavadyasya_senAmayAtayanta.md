## English translation:

“(The adherants of **Vṛtra**) encountered the army of the irreproachable (**Indra**); men of holy lives encouraged him. Scattered before him, conscious (of their inferiority), like the emasculated contending with men, they fled by precipitous paths.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kṣitayaḥ navagvāḥ = men whose practices were commendable; the men may be the **aṅgirasas** offering libations to Indra for nine months
