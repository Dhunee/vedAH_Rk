## English translation:

“Bring wealth, thunderers, and give it to us; protect us, **Indra** and **Agni**, by your deeds; may those rays of the sun, by which our forefathers have attained together a hevenly region, shine also upon us.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Rays of the sun: the radiance of Indra and Agni, as identical with the sun; by praisint the sun, therefore, Indra and Agni are praised also: terciṣamabhisaṃbhavantyarciṣohaḥ (**Chāndoga** **Upaniṣad**. 5.10.1);

Sapitvam = sahaprāptavyam sthānam, a plural ce to be obtained together, i.e. the world of **Brahmā**, to which the pious proceed by the path of light, etc. (arcirādi-mārgeṇa brahmalokam upāsakā gacchanti)
