## English translation:

“I have heard, **Indra** and **Agni**, that you are more munificent givers than an unworthy bridegroom, or the brother of a bride; therefore, as I offer you **a Soma** libation, I address you, Indra and Agni, with a new hymn.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

An unworthy bridegroom: vijamātṛ; the prefix vi- refers to a son-in-law (jāmātṛ) who is not possessed of the qualifications required by the **Vedas**, and who is, therefore, obliged to conciliate his father-in-law by libereal gifts. In **Nirukta** 6.9 vījamātrī = asusamāpta, the unfulfilled, or unaccomplished bridegroom. There may no implication of a bride-price: 'let no father who knows the law receive a gratuity, however small, for giving his daughter in marriage, since the man who, through avarice, takes a gratuity for that purpose is a seller of his offspring' (Laws of **Manu**, III.51); 'A bribe, whether large or small, is an actual sale of the daughter, although a bull and cow might be given at a marriage of saintly person ns or ṛṣis' (Laws of Manu, III.53). **syāla** = brother of the maiden, who makes her gifts through affection;

Sya = winnowing-basket;

Lo = **lājā**, fried grains (scattered at the marriage ceremony by the bride's brother)
