## English translation:

“The sacred prayer, desiring your presence, offers to you both, **Indra** and **Agni**, for your exhilaration, the **Soma** libation; do you two, who have horses, handsome arms, and graceful **hands**, come quickly and mix (the libation) with sweetness in the waters.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Devi** **dhiṣaṇā** = divine speech (sacred prayer);
