## English translation:

“I have heard, (when you were present) at the division of the treasure (among the worshippers), that you two, **Indra** and **Agni**, were most vigorous in the destruction of **Vṛtra**; beholders of all things seated at this sacrifice upon the sacred grass, be exhilarated, (by drinking of the effused libation).”
