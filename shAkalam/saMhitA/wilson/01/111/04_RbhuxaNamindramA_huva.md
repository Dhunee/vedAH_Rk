## English translation:

“I invoke the mighty **Indra** for protection, and the **Ṛbhu**, **Vājas** and **Maruts** to drink the **Soma**, also both **Mitra**, **Varuṇa** and the **Aśvins**; and may they direct us to opulence, to holy rites, and to victory.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Ṛbhukṣaṇam indram: Indra who is Ṛbukṣin (of which Ṛbhukṣaṇam is the accusative ative), i.e. the mighty Indra; ṛbhūn and vājān, plural accusative, refer to the three sons of **Sudhanvan**: Ṛbhu, **Vibhu** and **Vāja** (**Nirukta** 11.16)
