## English translation:

“For he is the performer of rites, he is the destroyer and reviver (of all things), and, like a friend he is the donor of unattained wealth; all men reverencing the gods, and approaching the well-looking **Agni**, repeat his name first in holy rites.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Marya and **sādhu** = destroyer and reviver; or, killer or extirpator of all and the producer
