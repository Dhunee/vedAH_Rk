## English translation:

“Thus has **Agni**, the celebrator of sacrifices, and by whom all things are known, been hymned by the pious descendant of **Gotama**; to them he has given the bright **Soma** to drink, along with the sacrificial food, and gratified by our devotion, he obtains nutriment (for himself).”
