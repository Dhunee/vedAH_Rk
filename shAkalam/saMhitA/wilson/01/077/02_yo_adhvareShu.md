## English translation:

“Bring hither, with praises, him who is most constant in sacrifice, observant of truth, and the invoker (of the gods), for **Agni**, when he repairs to the gods on the part of man, knows those (who are to be worshipped), and worships them with reverence.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Manasā** = with the mind; this is read as: namasā = with reverence, assuming a transposition
