## English translation:

“Having come in the early morning, (**Svanaya**) presents precious (wealth), knowing it (to be worthy of acceptance); and having, (therefore), accepted it, (**Kakṣīvat**) brings it (to his father); wherewith the parent of excellent sons, maintaining his progeny, passes his life in the enjoyment of affluence.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Legend: Kakṣīvat, having finished his course of study, and taken leave of his preceptor, journeyed homewards. As he fell asleep by the road-side, **Rājā** Svanaya, the son of Bhāvavyavya, attended by his retinue, came by and disturbed the **brāhmaṇa**'s slumber. Rājā was struck by Kakṣīvat's person nality and got the latter married to ten of his daughters, presenting him with a hundred **niṣkas** of gold, a hundred horses, a hundred bulls, one thousand and sixty cows and eleven four-horse-drawn-chariots (one each the wives and one for Kakṣīvat). Kaksīvat returned home and presented the gifts to his father, **Dīrghatamas**. The hymn is a praise of the munificence of Svanaya
