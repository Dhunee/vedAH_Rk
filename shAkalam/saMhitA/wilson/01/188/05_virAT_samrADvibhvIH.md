## English translation:

“They have sprinkled water on the doors (of the hall of sacrifice), which are variously and perfectly radiant, manifold, excellent, many, and numerous.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The doors: virāt samrāt. vibhvīḥ prabhvīḥ bahvīśca bhūyasīśca yāḥ: the last two epithets are epithets of number, and the rest are names
