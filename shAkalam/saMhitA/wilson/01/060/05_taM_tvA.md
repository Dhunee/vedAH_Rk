## English translation:

“We, born of the race of **Gotama**, praise you, **Agni**, with acceptable (hymns), as the lord of riches; rubbing you, the bearer of oblations, (as a rider rubs down), a horse; may he who has acquired wealth by sacred rites, come hither quickly in the morning.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

The text has only rubbing or rather, sweeping, you as a horse; expanded as, brushing the plural ce of the fire for the burnt-offering, the altar. This is comparable to a person n who mounts a horse first rubs with his **hands** the back of the horse
