## English translation:

“May our newest celebration come before that **Agni**, who is sweet-tongued, and is to be engendered in the heart; whom men, the descendants of **Manu**, sacrificing and presenting oblations to him, beget in the time and battle.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Navyasī **sukīrtiḥ** = newest celebration, as if the hymn were of very recent composition; agni is engendered of air; but, that air is the vital air or breath; agni, therefore, is produced in the heart, or in the interiors of the human body; in the time of battle = in order to make burnt offerings to secure success
