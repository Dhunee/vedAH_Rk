## English translation:

“**Mātariśvan** brought, as a friend, to **Bhṛgu**, the celebrated **Vahni**, the illuminato of sacrifices, the careful protector (of his votaries), the swift-moving messenger (of the gods), the offspring of two parents, (to be to him) as it were a precious treasure.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya
