## English translation:

“May the three undecaying goddesses, givers of delight, Iḷā, **Sarasvatī**, and **Mahī** (= **Bhāratī**), sit down upon the sacred grass.”

## Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

**Mahi** = **Bhārati**; Iḷā, Sarasvatī, Bhāratī are person nifications of **agni**: agnimūrtayaḥ; they are also three person nified flames of fire. As goddesses, Iḷā = earth (bride of **Viṣṇu**);

Sarasvatī = goddess of eloquence (wife of **Brahmā**);

**Bharatī** = speech (wife of **Bharata**, an **Āditya**)
