I take these three Anuṣṭubh verses as the singer’s performance of the recital of deeds promised in 6ab, but cast in the language of dramatic immediacy - almost “you are there” - with the singer himself as the supposed witness, addressing the waters in 7ab. Geldner (in his introduction.) also seems to assign the verses to the singer, while Oldenberg (1885: 57 n. 2) refuses to speculate.
