### English translation:

“The pious, desiring his protection, magnify him by ample and plural asure- yielding (libations); the earth,(and other worlds, spread out) like the branches of a tree, magnify **Indra**.”

Just him did the inspired poets, seeking aid, (increase) with downward  coursing help.  
The battle cries made Indra increase, as tree-branches do.
</details>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

I am puzzled as to what “downward coursing help(s)” (pravátvatībhir ūtíbhiḥ) might be. As Geldner points out, vs. 25 shows that the instr. phrase should be construed with avardhayan and so it must be help that the poets are giving Indra rather than getting from him (though they themselves are also avasyávaḥ ‘seeking aid’). The stem pravátvant- is generally used of landscape/cosmic features that have a gentle, and by implication pleasant and easily traversed, slope; see esp. V.54.9, where heaven and earth, the paths, and the mountains all provide a pravát- for the Maruts’ journey. The help provided to Indra by the poets may be of the same quality, smoothing and easing his journey to the sacrifice and his participation in it. In our 8b we met waters at play going along a slope (pravátā). Again ‘downhill, sloping down’ implies the path of least resistance and the opposite of effortful activity. If the identification of the poets with the Maruts suggested above is correct, it might be worth noting that four of the seven forms of pravátvant- are found in a single verse in a Marut hymn (the aforementioned V.54.9).

We meet vayā́iva again, repeating the simile of 6c. As in 6 I think that the tree branches are compared with Indra (and hence are acc. here), rather than being compared to the battle cries. They make Indra grow as tree-branches grow.

This tṛca begins and ends in the same way: 16a índraṃ vardhantu no gíraḥ and 18c tám íd vardhantu no gíraḥ … In between are several clauses with augmented verb forms (aor. arāniṣuḥ 16c, impf. avardhayan 17c, aor. atnata 18b). It is not immediately clear if these form a mythological or historical sequence or are unconnected observations about the mythological and/or historical past. The most specific statement is found in 18ab, with the gods stretching the sacrifice tríkadrukeṣu. This same verse is found in VIII.92.12, which, however, provides no contextual help. But, as Geldner points out, in I.32.3 Indra drinks soma tríkadrukeṣu before the Vṛtra battle, and II.11.17 and II.22.1 suggest the same scenario. If 18ab is somehow concerned with a soma sacrifice connected to the Vṛtra battle, then 17 may belong to the same complex, with the “inspired poets” of 17ab perhaps being the Maruts, who in some version of the myth encouraged Indra before the Vṛtra battle, and, again perhaps, their battle cries also strengthening Indra in 17c. Note that JPB tentatively identifies the Trikadrukas in I.32.3 and II.11.7, 22.1 as the Maruts. The clause in 16c may also belong with these mythological references, if the clans (víśaḥ) are the same as or equatable with the marútvatīr víśaḥ in 28c.
