Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
Each of the four verses contains at least one form of “purify oneself/self-purifying,”  with three such imperatives in verse 2. That verse seems to contain a trio of elemental  substances, which are also connected with the ritual: waters, plants, and, in our interpre tation, the hearths as holy places, representative of fire. Soma as finder of good things  for us provides a thematic ring for the hymn; in verse 1 he finds the material and psy chological goods men desire, while in verse 4 he has raised the stakes to the cosmic level.
