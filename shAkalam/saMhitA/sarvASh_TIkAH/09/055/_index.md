Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
The first three verses of the hymn are unified by a reference to the stalk (ándhas) of  the soma plant, although the role of the stalk is somewhat vague. Verse 1 is notable  for its mention of agriculture, though again the relevance is not entirely clear. The  martial Soma is on display in verse 4.

<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The first three vss. of this hymn all contain a form of the stem ándhas- ‘stalk’. On this word see comm. ad IV.1.19; the tr. of Geldner (“Trank”) and Renou (“jus”) are misleading.
