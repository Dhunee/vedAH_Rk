Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
In this little hymn, Soma is explicitly or implicitly compared to rain (vs. 1), a war rior (vs. 2), a law-abiding king or his subject (vs. 3), and a falcon in its nest (vs. 3).  The ambiguity of the term “keeping his commandments well, having good com mandments” in verse 3 allows the description to apply either to the imposer of the  commandments, the king, or to those who abide by them, the vassals. The final  verse (4) is, as so often, the locus of our requests.
