This set of verses forms a small internal ring: 12 and 15 contain ṛtám and návyam / návyaḥ (though not to the same stem: návya- in 12, the comparative návyas- in 15, both neut. sg.), while 13-14 contain the responsive sattó (…) manuṣvád ā́, devā́n … vidúṣtaraḥ.

I do not know why 13cd and 14ab are virtually identical. Perhaps it shows that the poet/sacrificer can now make the ritual happen. The yakṣi of the 13d is a praiṣa of sorts, and then the poet somewhat triumphantly reports that his command worked.
