### English translation:

“\[9-10\] May **Agni**, who is possessed of manifold light, like the extinguisher of the dawn, the granter of dwellings, and of cognizable form, consider (the desires of) this, (his worshipper); (his rays), spontaneously bearing the oblation, open the doors (of the sacrificial chamber), and all spread through the visible heaven.”

### Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Uṣo na **jāraḥ**: extinguisher of the dawn, is explained by jarayitrī, the causer of decay. The dawn is obliterated by the superior radiance of the sun

Ruddy and far-radiant like the lover of Dawn,  
he will be conspicuous to him [=the sacrificer?] as the one whose very  form has been produced in unison.
</details>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The first pāda is identical to 1b and thus forms a ring.

Grassmann, Geldner, Renou (apparently), and Lubotsky take usráḥ as gen. to uṣár-, but since there exists a robust stem usrá- ‘ruddy’, I see no reason not to take it as nom. sg. to that stem, esp. since vibhā́van- doesn’t otherwise take a gen.: the three passages Geldner adduces are not compelling.

As discussed in the published introduction, I do not follow the standard interpr. of sáṃjñāta-rūpa-, i.e., “having (his) well-known form,” since the idiom sám √jñā has a quite specific meaning ‘come to agreement’. The idiom is distinctive enough, and the compound is heavy enough, that that idiom is surely meant, esp. because it appears in finite form in I.68.8. Instead of being an anodyne description of the fire, this is a meaningful characterization of the shared clan-fire as the symbol of, and the product of, the mutual and unified ritual activity of the clans. Unfortunately, to render this comprehensibly in English requires a heavy and awkward locution.

The referent of asmai is not entirely apparent. The standard solution, going back to Sāyaṇa, is that it is the sacrificer. This is basically correct. However, the lack of accent on the pronoun should require that the referent is already present in the discourse. I suggest that it is to be found in the 1st ps. subject of áhve “I have summoned” in vs. 6, a subject that may be one of the ritual participants or, as suggested above, the Kriegskönig. Switch between persons is of course extremely common in the RV.
