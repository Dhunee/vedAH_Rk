### English translation:

“\[9-10\] Let us approach that blazing **Agni** with animal and vegetable offerings, as cows hasten to their stalls. He has tossed about his flames (in every direction), like running streams of water; the rays comingle (with the radiance) visible in the sky.”

### Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Caratha and vasthaya are explained as animal and vegetable offerings; further elaboration: tat prabhāvaiḥ bṛdayādibhiḥ sādhyāhutiḥ, paśuprabhāva-hṛdayādisādhanāyāhutya, these are invocations prompted by minds purified by offerings of moveable things, that is, animals; or of immoveable things, as rice, and the like

With our movable (goods [=livestock]) and with our settled  
household, we,  
like cows (going) home, approach him, on your behalf, when he has  been kindled.

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As indicated in the published introduction, I consider the last two verses of the hymn to reflect the ritual situation. This scenario is supported by the presence of 1st and 2nd pronouns (vayám and vaḥ respectively), with the 2nd ps. enclitic indicating, as often, the other human participants and observers besides the poet and priests, who are the “we.” The crux in this verse is carā́thā. The first problem with it is the long ā in the 2nd syllable, the only instance of such a stem in the transmitted RV beside regularly formed carátha- (13x). However, the situation is more complex: 4 of the transmitted carátha- forms occur in the Parāśara hymns (I.68.1, 70.3, 7, 72.6), but of these, 3 (68.1, 70.3, 7) would be metrically better if read *carā́tha-. I have no explanation for the variation and will not pursue the issue further. More interesting is the grammatical identity of the form and the semantic role it plays in the verse. Oldenberg (SBE, Noten) and Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take it as a nom. pl. ‘wanderers’, neuter if flg. the Pp., though Geldner suggests that it might reflect masc. carā́thāḥ. They further interpret it as conjoined with vayám (Oldenberg, Geldner) or identified with it (Witzel Gotō). However, in the Noten (ad loc., fn. 1) Oldenberg allows the possibility that the form could be an instr. parallel with vasatyā́(“mit Gehen und mit Verweilen”), an idea that Renou develops, suggesting that the pair are semantically parallel to the contrastive pair yóga / kṣéma (roughly “activity and rest”). Renou believes that the instrumentals characterize Agni (“(soit) dans (sa) marche, (soit) dans (sa) demeure”). This is possible, though it would be a slightly odd use of the instr. With Renou I consider carā́thā an instr. contrasting with vasatyā́, but think that the pair is applicable to “us”: we approach Agni with homage with both our movable goods, that is, the livestock that provides the butter and milk offerings, and our household establishment that supplies the rest.

The 3rd pl. nákṣante (nákṣanta in sandhi) does not agree with its 1st pl. subject vayám. With Geldner I take it as attraction to the immediately preceding simile, ástaṃ ná gā́vaḥ. It is accented because it begins the pāda.
