### English translation:

“\[9-10\] The wise, (first) honouring **Agni**, as they do a dwelling, worship him who implants their (peculiar) virtues in herbs, as progeny in their parents, and who, the source of knowledge and of all sustenance, (abides) in the domicile of the waters.”

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The second half of the verse is metrically disturbed. As Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition note in their metrical commentary, it actually reads better as a Triṣṭubh, as is occasionally the case with Dvipadā Virāj.

The syntax of the verse is also problematic. The two utá-s of c are difficult to construe, and partly for this reason Grassmann, Oldenberg (SBE [disavowed in Noten]), Renou, and Klein (DGRV 358) emend prajā́utá to prajā́su (presumably then *prajā́sūtá in the Saṃhitā text, though it’s not stated). If the original text had read this, it is hard to see why it would have become corrupted, given the two other loc. pl. in this verse. I consider the problematic utá-s and the problematic prajā́ḥ connected and suggest that the utá-s are connecting different entities: the first connects the nominatives yáḥ … utá prajā́ḥ “who [Agni] and his offspring” (not grammatical in English, of course, but possibly so in Skt; consider the common “X and which Y” construction), the second the locatives vīrútsu … utá prasū́ṣu antáḥ “in the sprouts and within the fruitful (plants).” Both Agni and his offspring grow in both media; note that because of its sandhi position ródhan can be both sg. (ródhat) and pl. and thus construed with both suggested subjects.

Note also that the verse begins ví REL, just like vs. 8, but with entirely different referents for the rel. pronoun. This might be another reason why 8ab shifts to the plural, to establish the difference between those who serve Agni and Agni himself.
