### English translation:

“\[5-6\] Praises are addressed to him who has repaired (to the solemnity); oblations (are offered) to him who has gone (to the sacrifice); in him is all sustenance, (and to him) have all (devout person ns) performed (the customary) rites. Do you, **Agni**, knowing (the thoughts of the worshipper), grant riches to him who presents to you oblations, or who wishes (to be able to present them).”

The promptings of truth, the vision of truth—  
all have performed their tasks lifelong.
</details>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The logical and syntactic connections between the nominal expressions of ab and the clause in cd are not clear. Geldner simply pronounces ab elliptical and suggests supplying cakruḥ from cd, while Renou supplies “(telles sont/est)” with the two phrases.

My assumption is that the promptings and vision of truth are the indirect cause of the actions in cd by defining the proper tasks that all should perform throughout their lifetimes.
