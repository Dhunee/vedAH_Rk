### English translation:

“\[5-6\] **Agni**, the lord of night, grants riches to the worshipper who adores him with sacred hymns. Agni, who are omniscient, and know the origin of gods and men, protect all these (beings dwelling) upon earth.”

### Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Kśapāvān: capable of destroying (the **rākṣasas**); or, having or possessing the night; **āgneyi** vai **rātriḥ**, night is characterized by Agni (**Taittirīya** **Brāhmaṇa** 2.1.2.7); agnirjyotiḥ jyotiragniḥ **svāhā** (**agnyādheya** ceremony: Taittirīya **Āraṇyaka** 4.10.5)

For Agni, the protector of riches on earth, does ritual service (for him  [=the mortal])  
who does ritual service for him [=Agni] fittingly with good hymns.

<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

The interpretation of kṣapā́vant- as ‘earth-protector’, containing a zero-grade form of the archaic noun kṣám- ‘earth’, goes back at least to the Petersburg dictionary and is the overwhelming consensus in Western scholarship (see EWA, s.v. kṣám-). However, a connection with the root noun kṣáp- ‘night’ has a more ancient pedigree: the Pp. divides the word kṣapā́‘vān, and Sāyaṇa comments kṣapeti rātrināma / rātrimān / āgneyī vai rātriḥ. At the very least we have a potential pun, and this pun is actually realized in this hymn, since vs. 7b, two verses later, contains the relatively rare root noun kṣáp-. Though vs. 5 has no mention of night and ‘earth-protector’ works fine in that context, the surfacing of kṣáp- ‘night’ so soon after might make the audience reconsider and produce a secondary semantic association for kṣapā́vān.

With a suggestion of Scarlatta (1999: 303), we could then analyze kṣapā́vant- as based on a syntagm with original predicative instrumental (kṣapā́“[he is] with night”), which was then provided with a -vant- possessive suffix. Scarlatta (1999: 303) also suggests other ways to incorporate kṣáp-‘night’, e.g., by haplology from

*kṣápā + pā́- ‘protecting by night’ (his reconstructed initial accent reflects a posited
adverbial accent shift from inst. kṣapā́; see p. 303 and n. 452). The exact details matter less than the fact that the Vedic audience could likely see a pun in this word, between kṣa- as a combining form of kṣám- ‘earth’ and kṣap- ‘night’. The published translation

“protector of riches on earth” reflects the standard Western interpr., though with an adjustment to incorporate rayīṇā́m; I do believe that the pun on ‘night’ was available to the audience, however. (See also X.29.1 and Jamison 2015 [Gerow Fs., IJHS 19].) It should also be noted, however, that the analysis ‘earth-protector’ for kṣapā́vān is reinforced in the next vs. (6ab) by an apparent paraphrase etā́… bhūmā ní pāhi “protect these worlds.” The poet seems to be even-handedly offering alternative views of kṣapā́vān.

Most tr. take ab as a nominal clause with suppressed dative (asmai or the like), the antecdent of the yáḥ of the rel. cl. (“Agni is the protector … [for him] who…”). I follow the interpr. of Velankar (1993: 41), who takes dā́śat as the verb of both main and relative clauses, accented in the former because it is initial in its pāda (and in a hí clause), in the latter because it’s in a subordinate clause. This grammatical and semantic reciprocity would match that of the (asmai …) asmai, where the first, suppressed dative refers to the worshiper and the second overt one to Agni. The theme of reciprocity is prominent in this hymn group.
