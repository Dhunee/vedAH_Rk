### English translation:

“(Animated) by the libations offered by day and by night, (**Indra**) sharpens his vast thunderbolt against the beguiler (**Vṛtra**); he whose hundred (rays) attend him in his own abode, sending away, and bringing back (revolving) days.”

Along with the pressing stones, through (the periods) of the day and  through the nights, he [=Agni?] sprinkles [=prepares] the best mace,  when the master of artifice [=Indra?] (is there)—  
while into his own [=Agni’s] house (the Dawns?) proceed by the  
hundred: rolling up the days, they unroll them (again).

<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

As noted in the published introduction, this vs. is the hardest in the hymn and, as the middle vs., serves as an omphalos. It contains several temporal expressions and thus continues the theme of the passage of time found in the 2nd half of vs. 2, but the rest is rather unclear. My rendering is tentative and also differs considerably from those of others, the details of which cannot be fully covered here.

Already in pāda a the alternation of days and nights is alluded to with the polarized expression ahanyèbhir aktúbhiḥ. Although the adjectival form of ahanyàseems to invite an interpr. whereby the word modifies the adjacent instr. pl.

grā́vabhiḥ, the result, “with the daily pressing stones” (Geldner “mit den täglichen Presssteinen”), doesn’t make sense, and I prefer to follow Renou in considering it “une variante probable de áhabhir aktúbhiḥ.” Cf. áhobhiḥ ... aktúbhiḥ X.14.9 and, with lexical substitution, dyúbhir aktúbhiḥ (I.34.8, I.112.25, III.31.16).

A more serious problem is figuring out what action is being performed in the first hemistich. In literal terms, the subject, whoever it is, sprinkles the/a superior mace, along with or by means of the pressing stones. Assuming we take the verb ā́ jigharti seriously -- unlike Geldner and Renou, who tr. contextually (‘schleudert’ and ‘brandit’ respectively), with Geldner suggesting a possible derivation from √hṛ not √ghṛ -- the action is difficult to interpret, whoever the subject is. Why would one ‘sprinkle’ a mace? Oldenberg, flg. Bergaigne, suggests that the mace is really soma, but although we might think this would get us out of the difficulty, in fact the object of (ā́) √ghṛ is never the liquid sprinkled, but the object that is sprinkled with it.

Working backward from vss. 4-5, which have pretty clear references to Agni, I take Agni as the subject of ā́jigharti here. He prepares the mace by “sprinkling” it with his sparks, a sort of final or symbolic forging, while the soma produced by the pressing stones is sprinkled on the weapon at the same time. The two acts of sprinkling make the weapon ritually fit for use. (Agni’s ‘streaming’ rītí- is found in 4a—another configuration of Agni as a liquid or as controlling liquid.) Under this interpr. the three apparently anomalous forms of ā́√ghṛ in the RV, here and in IV.17.14 and X.6.4, can be given a unified interpr. All three have Agni as subj. (in my view), and in all three Agni “sprinkles” an object with his sparks. See comm. on the two other passages.

The loc. māyíni is a separate problem. The standard view is that it refers to an enemy at whom the vajra is wielded, hence tr. like Geldner’s “… schleudert er die beste Keule auf den Zauberischen,” which, as we saw, requires the verb ā́jigharti to be semantically twisted. But the near rhyme māyínī at the end of vs. 1 refers to a positively viewed figure (in my interpr.), the goddess Dawn, and I suggest that māyíni here, which occurs in the same prominent hemistich-final position, also identifies a positive figure -- in fact, Indra. Indra is called māyín- in VIII.76.1 and his māyā́- are often referred to (see the passages listed by Grassmann, s.v., including V.30.6 in this maṇḍala). If it is Indra, the loc. does not have to refer to the goal of a brandished weapon, but can simply be a type of loc. absolute: “when the māyín- (is there),” that is, when Indra attends the sacrifice.

The doubled preverb ā́, found both at the beginning of the hemistich and directly before the verb, seems to be a case of mere repetition. The second hemistich also contains a temporal expression, saṃvartáyanto ví ca vartayann áhā “rolling up the days, they unroll them (again).” The idiom sám/ví √vṛt is used of rolling up or out hides (cárma, VI.8.3, VIII.6.5), and this action is then metaphorically applied to darkness (támas-)(cf., e.g., V.31.3). The rolling up and out of darkness is thus a way of expressing the alternations of darkness and light, night and day -- in other words, a more poetic instantiation of the phrase in pāda a ahanyèbhir aktúbhiḥ. The problem is how to connect this fairly straightforward expression to pāda c, if it is connected. Although it is an easy assumption that cd has a subord. clause / main clause structure (so Geldner and Renou ), it is possible to take c as attached to the first hemistich and d independent (so Witzel Gotō and me). The next question is whether the pl. subject of pracáran and that of ví ca vartayan are coreferential, and if so, who are they? and whose “own house” (své dáme) do they enter? The latter question is easier to answer: (své) dáme is almost always Agni’s. I therefore think that yásya also refers to Agni, and this is indirect evidence for my identification of Agni as subj. of ā́jigharti. But who enters Agni’s house “by the hundred” (śatám) and rolls up and unrolls the days? In the published translation I tentatively identify the subj. as “dawns,” with full awareness that this is grammatically problematic: the pres. part.

vartáyantaḥ in d is masc., and so the only way to make this work is to assume that dawns are the subj. of c, but the subj. of d reverts to a generic masc. I suggested the dawns as subj. because they are the standard regulators of time (for this see VII.79.2, 80.1 with sám √vṛt and ví √vṛt respectively). Others (explicitly Witzel Gotō) suggest the gods or some subset thereof, but the gods don’t really have the role of causing the alternation of days and nights. I must leave the identity of the subject uncertain, although I am still inclined to think that it is at least an indirect ref. to the dawns.

I do not understand the function of vā in c; JSK does not discuss this passage.

As for the ca in d, I think it contrastively conjoins the preverbs sam and ví, even though the morphological formations to which these preverbs are attached are not parallel.
