### English translation:

“Glorifying them promptly, desiring not to bring (other) deities to (his) presence, let (the worshipper) associate his gifts with those wise (divinities) renowned for their velocity, and distributors (of rewards).”

Now (a man) paying mind to them, (who approaches) to the gods as if  to udders,  
he would keep company with a gift, through (the auspices of) the  
patrons famed on the course [=Maruts] and by their unguents.
</details>

<details><summary>Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

This vs. is a variant of 14, with the parts somewhat differently distributed.

The phrase devā́m̐áchā in b resembles ácha … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám in 14a, and it therefore seems prudent and economical to supply the same verb as in 14a.

Although in 14ab dānā́belonged to the same syntagm as ácha … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám, here it is construed with a different part of the sentence, with the opt. saceta ‘would/might/could keep company’. In 14 the poet was offering a gift to the Maruts; here he “keeps company with a gift” -- that is, receives it -- bestowed by the Maruts.

The situation is the standard reciprocal exchange of praise and worship for the gods for material benefits from the gods. The givers are first identified as sūrí-s ‘patrons’ (c), and one could think of the human patrons often so called, but pāda d makes it clear that the Maruts are meant, and the identification of the sūráyaḥ with the Maruts is even clearer in 16b.

The two instr. in d are off balance: yā́maśrutebhiḥ ‘famed on/by their course/journey’ modifies the Maruts, but, pace Grassmann, Geldner, and Witzel Gotō, añjíbhiḥ should not, because añjí- is only a noun ‘unguent, adornment’ (see in the next hymn V.53.4), not the adj. their tr. require. Renou recognizes the problem and suggests that it is an “instrumental of identification”: “en tant que (porteurs d’) ornements.” I think rather that yā́ma- and añjíbhiḥ are functionally parallel, both to be construed with śrutá-, but one in a cmpd and one in an independent syntagm. For similar interplay between cmpd member and independent word, see comm. ad VIII.1.2.

The real problem in this vs. is vakṣáṇā. In the published translation I follow Geldner and Renou in taking it as an acc. pl. of vakṣáṇā ‘udder’, but of course this stem is fem. and the acc. pl. form here should be vakṣáṇāḥ. Geldner (n. 15b) casually suggests that it is exceptionally neuter or else a mistake for vakṣáṇāḥ, Renou that it’s a “nt. insolite.” Others provide different morphological analysis: Grassmann sets up a special stem vakṣáṇā ‘Darbringung’ and must take it as a nom. sg.; Oldenberg suggests emending the accent to

*vákṣaṇā, allowing it to belong to the stem vákṣaṇa- ‘strengthening’ and takes it as a
neut. nom. pl. (“wie zu den Göttern die Stärkungen”); Witzel Gotō maintain the ‘udder’ analysis but take it as a nom. sg.: “Der … (wendet) sich den göttlichen (Maruts) zu wie ein Schlauch (der gefüllt sein will).” This last is the most ingenious and does the least violence to the morphology / repertoire of stems, but the image is an odd one, to say the least. My explanation, admittedly rather weak, starts from the similar patterning of vss. 14 and 15: 1) the ácha + acc. gods noted above (though ácha differently positioned), in each case requiring a verb to be supplied; 2) dānā́(beg. of 14b/15c); 3) the parallel endings of the b pādas: 14b … ná yoṣánā / 15c … ná vakṣánā. The final word of each of these pādas is problematic: yoṣáṇā has the wrong accent, vakṣáṇā has the wrong ending. I suggest that the words were mutually adjusted to each other, either in composition or redactionally. Oldenberg already suggested (in his n. 2) that yoṣáṇā might owe its accent to vakṣáṇā, but the suggestion was halfhearted since he really wanted to emend the accent of vakṣáṇā to *vákṣaṇā, as I just noted. However, this seems the best explanation of the accent of yoṣáṇā, and conversely this allows us also to assume that acc. pl. *vakṣáṇāḥ lost its -ḥ to match yoṣánā. Although this may seem no different from Geldner’s and Renou’s arbitrary conferral of neut. gender, my explanation is contextually tied and has some possibility of being correct.
