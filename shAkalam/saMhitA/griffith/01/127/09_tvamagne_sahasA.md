Thou, Agni, most victorious with thy conquering strength, most Mighty One, art born for service of the Gods, like wealth for service of the Gods.  
     Most mighty is thine ecstasy, most splendid is thy mental power.  
     Therefore men wait upon thee, undecaying One, like vassals, undecaying One.
