Agni the Priest they supplicate to grant them wealth: him, dear, most thoughtful, have they made their messenger, him, offering-bearer have they made,  
     Beloved of all, who knoweth all, the Priest, the Holy one, the Sage--  
     Him, Friend, for help, the Gods when they are fain for wealth, him, Friend, with hymns, when fain for wealth.
