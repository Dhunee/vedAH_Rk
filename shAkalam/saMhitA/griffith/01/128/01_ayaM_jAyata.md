By Manu's law was born this Agni, Priest most skilled, born for the holy work of those who yearn therefore, yea, born for his own holy work.  
     All ear to him who seeks his love and wealth to him who strives for fame,  
     Priest ne'er deceived, he sits in Ila's holy place, girt round in Ila's holy place.
