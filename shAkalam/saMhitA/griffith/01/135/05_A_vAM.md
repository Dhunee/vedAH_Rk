May our songs bring you hither to our solemn rites: these drops of mighty vigour have they beautified, like a swift steed of mighty strength.  
     Drink of them well-inclined to us, come hitherward to be our help.  
     Drink, Indra-Vayu, of these Juices pressed with stones, Strength-givers! till they gladden you.
