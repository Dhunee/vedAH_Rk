Purified by the stones the Soma flows for thee, clothed with its lovely splendours, to the reservoir, flows clad in its refulgent light.  
     For thee the Soma is poured forth, thy portioned share mid Gods and men.  
     Drive thou thy horses, Vayu, come to us with love, come well-inclined and loving us.
