STREWN is the sacred grass; come Vayu, to our feast, with team of thousands, come, Lord of the harnessed team, with hundreds, Lord of harnessed steeds!  
     The drops divine are lifted up for thee, the God, to drink them first.  
     The juices rich in sweets have raised them for thy joy, have raised themselves to give thee strength.
