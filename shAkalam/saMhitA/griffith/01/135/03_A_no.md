Come thou with hundreds, come with thousands in thy team to this our solemn rite, to taste the sacred food, Vayu, to taste the offerings.  
     This is thy seasonable share, that comes co-radiant with the Sun.  
     Brought by attendant priests pure juice is offered up, Vayu, pure juice is offered up.
