Hear, Indra, thou whom men in every fight must call to show thy strength, for cry of battle with the men, with men of war for victory.  
     He who with heroes wins the light, who with the singers gains the prize,  
     Him the rich seek to gain even as a swift strong steed, even as a courser fleet and strong.
