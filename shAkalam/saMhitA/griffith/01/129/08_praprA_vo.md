On, for your good and ours, come Indra with the aid of his own lordliness to drive the wicked hence, to rend the evil-hearted ones!  
     The weapon which devouring fiends cast at us shall destroy themselves.  
     Struck down, it shall not reach the mark; hurled forth, the fire-brand shall not strike.
