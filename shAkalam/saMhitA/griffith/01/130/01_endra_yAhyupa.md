Come to us, Indra, from afar, conducting us even as a lord of heroes to the gatherings, home, like a King, his heroes' lord.  
     We come with gifts of pleasant food, with juice poured forth, invoking thee,  
     As sons invite a sire, that thou mayst get thee strength thee, bounteousest, to get thee strength.
