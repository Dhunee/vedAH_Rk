Eager for riches, men have formed for thee this song, like as a skilful craftsman fashioneth a car, so have they wrought thee to their bliss;  
     Adorning thee, O Singer, like a generous steed for deeds of might,  
     Yea, like a steed to show his strength and win the prize, that he may bear each prize away.
