For Puru thou hast shattered, Indra ninety forts, for Divodasa thy boon servant with thy bolt, O Dancer, for thy worshipper.  
     For Atithigva he, the Strong, brought Sambara. from the mountain down,  
     Distributing the mighty treasures with his strength, parting all treasures with his strength.
