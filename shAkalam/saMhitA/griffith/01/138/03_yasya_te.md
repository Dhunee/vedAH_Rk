Thou, Pusan, in whose friendship they who sing forth praise enjoy advantage, even in wisdom, through thy grace, in wisdom even they are advanced.  
     So, after this most recent course, we come to thee with prayers for wealth.  
     Not stirred to anger, O Wide-Ruler, come to us, come thou to us in every fight.
