For the broad Sun was seen a path more widely laid, the path of holy law hath been maintained with rays, the eye with Bhaga's rays of light.  
     Firm-set in heaven is Mitra's home, and Aryaman's and Varuna's.  
     Thence they give forth great vital strength which merits praise, high power of life that men shall praise.
