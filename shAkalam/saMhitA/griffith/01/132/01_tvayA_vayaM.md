HELPED, Indra Maghavan, by thee in war of old, may we subdue in fight the men who strive with us, conquer the men who war with us.  
     This day that now is close at hand bless him who pours the Soma juice.  
     In this our sacrifice may we divide the spoil, showing our strength, the spoil of war.
