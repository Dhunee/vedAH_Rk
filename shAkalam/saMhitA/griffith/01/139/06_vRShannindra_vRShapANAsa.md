These Soma-drops, strong Indra! drink for heroes, poured, pressed out by pressing-stones, are welling forth for thee, for thee the drops are welling forth.  
     They shall make glad thy heart to give, to give wealth great and wonderful.  
     Thou who acceptest praise come glorified by hymns, come thou to us benevolent.
