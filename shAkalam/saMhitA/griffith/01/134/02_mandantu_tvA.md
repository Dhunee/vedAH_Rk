May the joy-giving drops, O Vayu gladden thee, effectual, well prepared, directed to the heavens, strong, blent with milk and seeking heaven;  
     That aids, effectual to fulfil, may wait upon our skilful power.  
     Associate teams come hitherward to grant our prayers: they shall address the hymns we sing.
