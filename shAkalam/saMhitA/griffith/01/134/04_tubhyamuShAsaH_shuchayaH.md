For thee the radiant Dawns in the far-distant sky broaden their lovely garments forth in wondrous beams, bright-coloured in their new-born beams.  
     For thee the nectar-yielding Cow pours all rich treasures forth as milk.  
     The Marut host hast thou engendered from the womb, the Maruts from the womb of heaven.
