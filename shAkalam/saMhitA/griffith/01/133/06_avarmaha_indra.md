Tear down the mighty ones. O Indra, hear thou us. For heaven hath glowed like earth in fear, O Thunder-armed, as dreading fierce heat, Thunder-armed!  
     Most Mighty mid the Mighty Ones thou speedest with strong bolts of death,  
     Not slaying men, unconquered Hero with the brave, O Hero, with the thrice-seven brave.
