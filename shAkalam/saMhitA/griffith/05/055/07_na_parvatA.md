Neither the mountains nor the rivers keep you back: whither ye have resolved thither ye, Maruts, go.  
     Ye compass round about even the heaven and earth. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.  
     Whate'er is ancient, Maruts, what of recent time, whate'er is spoken, Vasus, what is chanted forth,  
     They who take cognizance of all of this are ye. Their cars moved onward as they went to victory.
