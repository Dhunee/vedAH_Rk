Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and passed away into the darkness.  
     Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men prolong existence.  
12, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in himself, hath entered mortals.  
     So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace and favour.
