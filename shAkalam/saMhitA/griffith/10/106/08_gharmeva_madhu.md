With your bellies full of the Soma, like two saucepans, preservers of wealth, destroyers of enemies.  
     (you are) armed with hatchets, moving like two flying (birds)  
     with forms like the moon, attaining success through the mind, like two laudable beings,  
     (you are) approaching (the sacrifice).
