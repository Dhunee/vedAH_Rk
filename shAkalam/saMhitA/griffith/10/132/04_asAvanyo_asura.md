That other, Asura! too was born of Heaven. thou art, O Varuna, the King of all men.  
     The chariot's Lord was well content, forbearing to anger Death by sin so great.  
     This sin hath Sakaputa here committed. Heroes who fled to their dear friend he slayeth,  
     When the Steed bringeth down your grace and favour in bodies dear and worshipful.
