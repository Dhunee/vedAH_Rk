O King, whoever, be he friend or kinsman, hath threatened me affrighted in my slumber-  
     If any wolf or robber fain would harm us, therefrom, O Varuna, give thou us protection.  
11May I not live O Varuna, to witness my wealthy, liberal dear friend's destitution.  
     King, may I never lack well-ordered riches. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in assembly.
