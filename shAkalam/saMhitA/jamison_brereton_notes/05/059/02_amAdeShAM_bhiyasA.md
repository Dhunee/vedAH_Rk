The published interpr. of d follows Thieme (Untersuchungen, p. 39). Witzel Gotō draw attention to Thieme’s revised interpr., in Kl. Sch. II.998-99 (and 834), in which he takes mahé as a dual and vidathé as a final dative: “sie halten inne, um den Regen zu verteilen,” closely followed by Witzel Gotō “… haben zwischen den zwei Grossen (Himmel und Erde) zur Verteilung (des Regens).” Some of this seems worth adopting.

Because of the antár a dual interpr. of mahé is attractive, but rather than separating vidáthe from mahé syntactically (the interposition of the caesura, invoked by Thieme and Witzel Gotō, does not seem sufficient reason) and making it a dative (though the stem is otherwise only thematic and a dat. should be excluded), it seems best to return to Oldenberg’s suggestion that mahé vidáthe is a dual acc. phrase, as it is in VIII.39.1. I would then emend the tr. to “the men have taken their places between the two great divisions [=Heaven and Earth].” This is in fact where the Maruts as thunderstorm are positioned -- in the midspace.
