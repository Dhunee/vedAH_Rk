As suggested already by Geldner (n. 5b) and, independently, Thieme (ZDMG 95 [1941] 82-83 [=KlSch. 7-8]) and accepted by all subsequent tr., a better reading is obtained by segmenting duchúnām inavāma, against Pp. duchúnā minavāma. This requires no emendation to the Saṃhitā text.

As noted in the published introduction, these two vss. form an omphalos and are structurally parallel, with the poet addressing his priest-poet colleagues with hortatory subjunctives. The immediacy of the vss. and the sacrificial context of the hymn make this a more likely scenario than Sāyaṇa.’s suggestion that the Aṅgirases are speaking these vss. For strenuous arguments against Sāyaṇa.’s interpr., see Lüders p. 327.
