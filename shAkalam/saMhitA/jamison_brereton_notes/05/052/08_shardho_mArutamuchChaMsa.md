Geldner takes syandrā́(ḥ) as acc. pl. fem. and supplies antelopes as the obj. of yujata. This is not impossible, but syandrā́(ḥ) was already used of the Maruts in 3a (cf. also V.87.3).

I don't understand the force of utá sma, which opens 8c and 9a, with utá opening 9c. Klein (DGRV I.416-17) says that they introduce parallel statements about the Maruts and represent “concatenation across the stanza-boundary,” halfway between intrastanzaic and interstanzaic usage. But the role of sma, whatever it may be, seems downplayed in this description.
