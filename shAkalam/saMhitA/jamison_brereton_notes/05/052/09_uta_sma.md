The phrase páruṣṇyām ū́rṇā vasata is similar to IV.22.2 páruṣṇīm uṣámāṇa ū́rṇām, but while in the latter páruṣṇīm modifies ‘wool’, here it must be a loc. sg.

The ‘wool’ in both passages is best understood as a metaphor for ‘foam’. The stem páruṣṇī- is the fem. corresponding to paruṣá- ‘gray’. It is also a river name, presumably so called because it is covered with grayish foam. For disc. see Oldenberg, Hoffmann (Aufs. 333-35 [=Die Sprache 1974]). The mediating image in this picture is provided by śundhyávaḥ; I follow Thieme (KZ 79 [1965] = Kl Sch. 219ff.) in interpr. this form as ‘preening [waterbird]’ (to √śudh ‘clean’). As pointed out in the published introduction, the density of imagery is remarkable: the Maruts swathed in clouds (not explicitly mentioned) are compared to birds in a river covered with foam, with the foam (again not explicit) characterized as wool.

The instr. sg. pavyā́to the masc. stem paví- shows the older -ā ending, which becomes limited to fem. -i-stems when the masc./ neut. adopt -inā.

I don't understand the force of utá sma, which opens 8c and 9a, with utá opening 9c. Klein (DGRV I.416-17) says that they introduce parallel statements about the Maruts and represent “concatenation across the stanza-boundary,” halfway between intrastanzaic and interstanzaic usage. But the role of sma, whatever it may be, seems downplayed in this description.
