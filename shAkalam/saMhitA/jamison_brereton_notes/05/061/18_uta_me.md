The Rathavīti phrase is in the loc.; the published translation renders it as if the addressee, which is technically incorrect. It is either a loc. absol. without participle or a “chez/bei” expression: “speak for me thus when R. (is present) / at R’s.” Since the net result is the same, I have kept the easier-to-parse addressee tr.

As noted in the published introduction, the patron’s name Rathavīti (‘pursuit of the chariot’?) in 18, 19 is punned upon. In 17 (before he is explicitly mentioned, though the patronymic Dārbhya would presumably evoke him) Night is asked to carry the hymns “like a charioteer” (rathī́r iva); in 18 the 2nd cmpd. member -vīti- is derived from the same root √vī ‘pursue’ that supplies the verb ápa veti ‘goes off track’.
