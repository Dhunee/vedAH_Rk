The 2nd pl. impv. etana shows an unexpected full-grade root syllable in the Saṃhitā text, but is read with metrically problematic but morphologically “correct” zero-grade in the Pp (itana). Of course, such full-grade 2nd pl. impvs. are found elsewhere, but in this case I wonder if it’s a secondary extraction from forms cmpded with the preverb ā́, as in V.87.8, also a Marut hymn, with pāda-final étana. See also disc. ad VI.42.2.

The final word of vs. 3 is jánayaḥ, while the final word of the 1st hemistich of 4 is (bhadra-)jānayaḥ, showing the standard distribution of the ‘wife’ word, with simplex jáni- and jāni- as 2nd cmpd. member. The distrib. here is complicated by the fact that 3c … ná jánayaḥ produces an unusual cadence of four shorts, which

*jā́nayaḥ would easily repair. But since the long-vowel variant never shows up as a
simplex, we should presumably resist the temptation to emend.
