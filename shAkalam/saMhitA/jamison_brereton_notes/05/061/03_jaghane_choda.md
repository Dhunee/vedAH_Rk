For this vs. see published introduction.; as pointed out there, the simile in c can either refer to sex or to childbirth.

It is interesting that sakthā́ni is plural. Although there are plural ‘men’ (náraḥ) and therefore twice as many thighs as men, in Classical Sanskrit it is my impression that the dual would ordinarily be used in such a situation, where a number of men each spread their two thighs. RV seems more flexible.

The final word of vs. 3 is jánayaḥ, while the final word of the 1st hemistich of 4 is (bhadra-)jānayaḥ, showing the standard distribution of the ‘wife’ word, with simplex jáni- and jāni- as 2nd cmpd. member. The distrib. here is complicated by the fact that 3c … ná jánayaḥ produces an unusual cadence of four shorts, which

*jā́nayaḥ would easily repair. But since the long-vowel variant never shows up as a
simplex, we should presumably resist the temptation to emend.
