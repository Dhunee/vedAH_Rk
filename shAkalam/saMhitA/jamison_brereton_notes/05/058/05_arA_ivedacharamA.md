Note the phonetic play on initial a and final ā́: arā́... ácaramā́áheva ...

ákavā́.

The syntactic break in the middle of pāda a, after ivéd, and the enjambment across the pāda boundary, with áheva in pāda a the subj. of the verb prá-pra jāyante in b, give the sense of unstoppable motion that the similes also provide.

Flg. Hoffmann (Aufs. II.413 [=MSS 10 (1957) 61-62]), Witzel Gotō and Renou (though Renou rather mutedly) take ákavā(ḥ) as meaning that the Maruts do not become reduced in power, and Geldner’s rather vague ‘vollkommen’ is in the same realm, though obviously without the benefit of Hoffmann’s disc. I prefer to take the adj. as outerdirected -- ‘not stingy, unstinting’ rather than inner-directed ‘not retracting’. The VP sváyā matyā́… sám mimikṣuḥ “They have equipped themselves with their own poetic thought” seems implicitly to contrast with the opening of the previous hymn, V.57.1 iyáṃ vo asmát … matíḥ “This poetic thought from us for you.” This should remind us that the Maruts are both recipients and producers of praise poetry. See the disc. of the opening of this Marut cycle, V.52, where much is made of this dual role. A number of tr. take matí- as the equivalent of ‘will’ or ‘intention’ (van Bradke [Fs. Roth (1893) 119] Will, Geldner, Kümmel [386] Absicht, Witzel Gotō Antrieb), but this stretches the meaning of this word unacceptably. In any case the locution must harmonize with the very similar one in I.165.1 adduced also by Geldner: káyā śubhā́… marútaḥ sám mimikṣuḥ / káyā matī.
