vádhar appears here in the same metrical position as in 3b. There the weapon was Vṛtra’s (which Indra struck away), while here it is Indra’s. Another example of vocab. first used of Vṛtra reassigned to Indra -- like ékaḥ … apratíḥ in 3a and the similar expression in 9a. Indeed, ápratītam appears here in b, characterizing Indra’s weapon, which is ‘might’ itself (sáhaḥ). The use of sáhaḥ as an appositive here supports my view of the same usage of this word in V.31.3 (contra Geldner [/Witzel Gotō]). There it characterizes Indra himself. It is even possible that sáho ápratītam here is nominative and an appositive to índraḥ, rather than an acc. and appositive to vádhar, though the juxtaposition of the two terms in b makes that unlikely. In any case note the similarity in phrasing: 31.3a # úd yát sáhaḥ ... 32.7ab # úd yád ... sáhaḥ; the verbs in these clauses are also rhyming: 31.3 ájaniṣṭa, 32.7 yámiṣṭa.

As noted ad vs. 4, the poetic repair effected by prábhṛtā mádasya in 5c is somewhat muddied by 7c vájrasya prábhṛtau. What exactly this latter phrase means is not clear. I doubt that Geldner’s “im Schlag mit der Keule” is correct, since ‘strike’ is not a standard sense of prá √bhṛ (the closest we get is ‘bear down on’). Witzel Gotō’s “beim Vorführen des Vajra” is similar to my “at the proffering of the mace” (‘proffer’ having been chosen to match the tr. of this lexeme in 4c and 5c). The English idiom “present arms” is a direct correspondent, though the action in the English phrase is a gesture of respect, not (as here) of intimidation. The point of both úd … vádhar yámiṣṭa “held up his weapon” and vájrasya prábhṛtau seems to be to show Vṛtra the unbeatable power of the vájra-. See also the mahatā́vadhéna in 8c.

The recital of Indra’s deeds now reverts to the past tense, to a series of insistently augmented imperfects: 7b ámimīthāḥ, 7c agṛbhṇāḥ, 7d asedhaḥ, 8b áramayaḥ, 8c ayātam, ávahaḥ. (In 8d the Pp. reads unaug. áranta, but in its sandhi situation [uśánā́ranta] it could as easily be ā́ranta; the accent should be on the augment because it’s in a subordinate cl., but ā + áranta would come out this way.

Either way, it’s not an imperfect, but either a plupf. or a root aor., but this is a minor quibble.) However, note that this series is introduced by 7a tád ín nú te káraṇam “Just this now is your deed,” where the current situation (nú) remains in the forefront of the poet’s mind.

With Geldner (and contra Witzel Gotō, who suggest Śuṣṇa), I take the strong one (ugrám) in c as Uśanā. This is the usual, if wispy, account of Indra and Kutsa’s journey to Uśanā’s house for advice before the Śuṣṇa battle; cf. X.22.6.

The 2nd sg. ávaho ha kútsam “you (sg.) conveyed Kutsa,” following immediately on the 2nd du. ayātam “you two drove,” seems a quick correction or explanation. The 2nd du. ayātam may have seemed to suggest an equality and mutuality between Indra and Kutsa that might have seemed insulting to Indra’s divinity and greater power -- though the return of vām in d and the dual dvandva índrākutsā and dual verbs of vs. 9 show that the attempt to reestablish hierarchy was momentary.
