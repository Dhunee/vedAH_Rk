The verb ā́dat ‘took’ is superficially active, though the idiom ā́√dā ‘take’ is ordinarily middle. As was seen already by Wackernagel, the form must be a remarked form of the older 3rd sg. middle root aor. The underlying form would be *ā́da, which can represent either an old -t-less 3rd sg. mid. ending (as in impf. *áduha à áduha+t) or, more likely, the simplification by degemination of an old *ā́d+ta with an originally -t-full ending. Of course this preform should have yielded *ā́tta, but the fact that all other forms of the root aor. have a single d- (ádāt, etc.) could have induced the geminate to simplify (in this metrically non-diagnostic position after ā) and restore the d of the root. (Kümmel [Stativ 50-51] bases the -d-form on 3rd pl. ā́diran*.) In any case the t-less *ā́da would have been activized like the t-less middle imperfects of the áduhat type. The resulting “active” stem could spread elsewhere; cf. 1st pl. ā́dāma in nearby V.30.15. For disc. and previous lit. see Kümmel ref. above. The form is very differently explained by Oldenberg, who assigns it to ā √dṛ ‘tear out’ by way of the sandhi form *ā́daḥ (← 2nd/3rd sg. *ā́dar) and what seems to me a somewhat sketchy remarking with -t (as if 2nd sg. = *ā́das, so 3rd sg. should = *ā́dat?). The morphological machinery required seems too complex for its purpose, to avoid a slightly aberrant use of ā́√dā, and since ā́√dṛ doesn’t take personal objects (Oldenberg finds one late ex.), its usage here would be aberrant as well. Geldner assigns it to ā́√dā, as do Witzel Gotō (with ref. to Kümmel, Stativ).

For the third time in the hymn, Vṛtra is described as śáyānam ‘lying’, each time in the same pāda-final position (2c, 6a, 8a), and pāda-final níṣattam (5a) ‘sunk, lit. sitting, down’ may be a sort of semantic pun on this positional characterization. In I.32, the Indra-Vṛtra hymn with clear phraseological and thematic parallels to this one, √śi ‘lie’ is also Vṛtra’s signature verb, esp. describing his position after his defeat, rather than before, as here.

Geldner suggests that árṇam is an anticipatory haplology (not his term) for

*arṇapám ‘drinking the flood’, immediately before madhupám. He is followed by
Scarlatta (313 n. 444) and Witzel Gotō. I see no reason to accept this. The stem árṇa- exists; the stem *arṇapá- (/-pā́-) does not. More importantly, Vṛtra is known for confining the waters, not drinking them. As was just noted, √śi ‘lie’ is a defining verb for Vṛtra in both I.32 and this hymn. In the former he lies there as the released waters stream over him (I.32.8ab … amuyā́śáyānam, … áti yanty ā́paḥ; cf. also 8d, 10). Here, in complementary fashion, he is depicted as lying over them before his defeat.

Although most take atrá- as a PN, I still prefer the older derivation (see, e.g., Grassmann) from √ad ‘eat’ with simplification of the geminate (*at-trá-), pace EWA s.v. átri-. It does not have to have anything to do with the seer Atri (átri-), but átrin- ‘voracious’ is, in my opinion, derivationally connected.

The recital of Indra’s deeds now reverts to the past tense, to a series of insistently augmented imperfects: 7b ámimīthāḥ, 7c agṛbhṇāḥ, 7d asedhaḥ, 8b áramayaḥ, 8c ayātam, ávahaḥ. (In 8d the Pp. reads unaug. áranta, but in its sandhi situation [uśánā́ranta] it could as easily be ā́ranta; the accent should be on the augment because it’s in a subordinate cl., but ā + áranta would come out this way.

Either way, it’s not an imperfect, but either a plupf. or a root aor., but this is a minor quibble.) However, note that this series is introduced by 7a tád ín nú te káraṇam “Just this now is your deed,” where the current situation (nú) remains in the forefront of the poet’s mind.

With Geldner (and contra Witzel Gotō, who suggest Śuṣṇa), I take the strong one (ugrám) in c as Uśanā. This is the usual, if wispy, account of Indra and Kutsa’s journey to Uśanā’s house for advice before the Śuṣṇa battle; cf. X.22.6.

The 2nd sg. ávaho ha kútsam “you (sg.) conveyed Kutsa,” following immediately on the 2nd du. ayātam “you two drove,” seems a quick correction or explanation. The 2nd du. ayātam may have seemed to suggest an equality and mutuality between Indra and Kutsa that might have seemed insulting to Indra’s divinity and greater power -- though the return of vām in d and the dual dvandva índrākutsā and dual verbs of vs. 9 show that the attempt to reestablish hierarchy was momentary.
