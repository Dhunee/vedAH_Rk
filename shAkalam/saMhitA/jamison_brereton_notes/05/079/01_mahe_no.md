The phrase mahé … rāyé divítmatī is very reminiscent of IV.31.11 mahó rāyé divítmate, with an adverbial maháḥ but a dat. divítmate modifying rāyé. See comm. ad loc. It seems likely that our fem. divítmatī is a nonce adaptation to the fem.

context. As for divítmant-, I now tentatively accept the analysis of divít- as containing the root noun -i-t- and would alter the tr. to “as one coming from heaven” or “as heaven-sent one.”

These three vss. follow the same pattern: Dawn is urged to repeat for us now a previous action she performed in the presence of and for the benefit of a previous patron. The name Satyaśravas Vāyya appears in all three vss. (The Anukr.

attributes the hymn to Satyaśravas Ātreya, but as Geldner points out [n. 1d] he is surely the patron, not the poet.) Curiously in vss. 1 and 3 Satyaśravas Vāyya is identified as the previous patron, while in vs. 2 he is the current patron and the previous patron has a different name. This chronological slippage is somewhat confusing -- and is emphasized by having identical clauses differing only in the tense/mood of the verb and the demonstrative vs. relative pronoun: 2cd sā́vy ùcha sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé 3cd yó vyaúchaḥ sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé The insistence on this generous patron of the past has a purpose: there is a parallel insistence on the patrons of today in the rest of the hymn. Although only Dawn is addressed, the poet is clearly sending a message to the patrons, to generously redistribute the wealth that Dawn will bestow on them, on the model of Satyaśravas.
