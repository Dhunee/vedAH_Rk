yó beginning pāda c represents yā́+ u (note Pp. yó íti), but the apparent masc.

form causes a momentary stir.

These three vss. follow the same pattern: Dawn is urged to repeat for us now a previous action she performed in the presence of and for the benefit of a previous patron. The name Satyaśravas Vāyya appears in all three vss. (The Anukr.

attributes the hymn to Satyaśravas Ātreya, but as Geldner points out [n. 1d] he is surely the patron, not the poet.) Curiously in vss. 1 and 3 Satyaśravas Vāyya is identified as the previous patron, while in vs. 2 he is the current patron and the previous patron has a different name. This chronological slippage is somewhat confusing -- and is emphasized by having identical clauses differing only in the tense/mood of the verb and the demonstrative vs. relative pronoun: 2cd sā́vy ùcha sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé 3cd yó vyaúchaḥ sáhīyasi, satyaśravasi vāyyé The insistence on this generous patron of the past has a purpose: there is a parallel insistence on the patrons of today in the rest of the hymn. Although only Dawn is addressed, the poet is clearly sending a message to the patrons, to generously redistribute the wealth that Dawn will bestow on them, on the model of Satyaśravas.

Is the comparative ‘mightier’ (sáhīyas-) used to assert that Satyaśravas Vāyya is mightier than Sunītha Śaucadratha? The Pp. reads accented ví even directly before accented aúchaḥ (2b, 3c), where we might expect univerbation and loss of accent on the preverb. The Saṃhitā text is of course ambiguous.

sā́with the 2nd ps. impv. ucha simply shows the common use of the sá/tám prn.

with 2nd ps. impvs.; see my 1992 “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?” Elaborate semantic/functional interpr., like Renou’s “de la même manière, dans les mêmes conditions (heureuses)” (EVP 3, ad loc.) or Witzel Gotō’s yā́… sā́… “welche du … als solche du” are unnec.
