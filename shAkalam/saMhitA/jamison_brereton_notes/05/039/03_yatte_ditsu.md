I take ab as nominal rel. clause with a predicated grdv. prarā́dhyam, while Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) simply take it as a nom. cl. (“what is your thought…”). My tr. should be modified slightly to make it clear that the ásti is accented: “Which thought of yours, famed and lofty, eager to give, is to [/should] be realized, with it …” In cd both Geldner and Witzel Gotō separate the two pādas and supply a second verb (or, as far as I can tell, a 2nd exemplar of the overt verb ā́darṣi in different usage). I interpr. ā́darṣi as taking a double acc. in a condensed expression: “split X for (its contents) Y.” The lexeme ā́√dṛ can take as obj. either the container or the contained; for a similar double acc. with both see III.30.21 ā́no gotrā́dardṛhi … gā́ḥ “Split open the cowpens for the cows.”

In the refrain (1-3cd) the pl. ‘bulls’ (vṛ́ṣabhiḥ) accompanying Indra were identified with the Maruts already by Sāyaṇa. Since this section culminates in the Midday Pressing (4d), this identification makes sense, since that pressing is shared by Indra and the Maruts.
