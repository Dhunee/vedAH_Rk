The published translation takes āyúbhiḥ in c as a PN (as often), thus identifying a separate group of co-soma-drinkers. The standard tr. take the instr. phrase in c as a further characterization of the Maruts, with āyú- as ‘langlebig’ (Geldner, Witzel Gotō), ‘vigilants’ (Renou). I now think this is the better course and would emend the tr. to “along with the pure, lively ones who set all in motion.”
