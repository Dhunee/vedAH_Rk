The parallelism between the two loc. phrases pṛ̥ṣatīṣu śrutā́su (a) and sukhéṣu … rátheṣu (b) seems clear, but this entails that the Maruts are mounted both on their horses and on their chariots. This is a price that most tr. are willing to pay, but Renou avoids it at the price of the parallelism, by attaching the dappled females to the chariots: “… qui sont montés sur les chars aisés conduit par les (antilopes) tachetées.” Since the Maruts are clearly astride horses in the next hymn, V.61.3, I think we can have them there here as well.

The person changes between hemistichs from 3rd (ab: yé tasthúḥ) in the rel. cl.

to 2nd (cd: voc. ugrāḥ … vaḥ) in the main cl.. This is hardly unusual in the RV. The standard tr. register this anacoluthon in various ways, Witzel Gotō most sharply, by supplying a main cl. for ab: “(Sie sind es), die …” and separating the two hemistichs into two sentences. This seems unnec.

Note the concatenation: 2d … párvataś cit# // 3a #párvataś cit … The two vss. also hold the verb rejate/rejata steady (2d, 3b, though in slightly different metrical position, both post-caesura, with one pres. and the other injunc.), but in the first instance it’s earth (pṛthivī́) that trembles and in the 2nd (the back of) heaven (diváḥ, initial in its pāda like pṛthivī́). So the standard pair heaven/earth are contrasted and identically positioned, but they are grammatically non-parallel. There is also a repetition of ‘fear’, though again in different forms -- nominal bhiyā́in 2c, pf. bibhāya in 3c, both pāda-final. This kind of patterned and varied repetition may not reach the heights of poetic art, but it is a pleasing demonstration of the way a RVic poet infuses freshness into the clichéś that are his bread-and-butter.
