The mā́prohibitive here takes an apparent impv. hṛṇītām rather than the expected injunctive *hṛṇīta. Hoffmann (94-95) explains this as having an underlying pluti form hṛṇītā3, with nasalization in hiatus, hence *hṛṇītā3m̐, which was misunderstood by the redactors and normalized to hṛṇītām. Although I find this explan. rather ad hoc and over-complex, I have nothing better to suggest. I do not, however, subscribe to his notion that because it is built to a pres. stem, it has inhibitive (“let him stop being angry”) rather than prohibitive (“let him not be angry”) value. There is nothing in the hymn up to this point that would indicate that Agni has anything but benevolent feelings towards us. See Ian Hollenbaugh’s work, which refutes Hoffmann’s assumption of inhibitive value for pres. injunc. with mā́.

Pāda-final eṣáḥ is less rare than I would have predicted, though the usual position of nom. sg. eṣá(ḥ) is pāda initial.

Both vss. end identically with svadhvaráḥ, but in 12c it refers to Agni, in 13d to the weakling (kīrí-) who is offering homage to Agni. The use of the same term for both of course implicitly spreads the power and prestige of Agni to his worshiper.
