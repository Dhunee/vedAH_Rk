The 2 occurrences of tuṣṭuvúḥ are standardly interpr. as preterital (“… gepreisen haben”; see Geldner and Kümmel [578], as well as the published translation), but the context does not impose this value, and the existence of an augmented plupf. átuṣṭavam (III.53.12) with the same apparent meaning is disturbing. It is therefore possible that the verbs here should be rendered “… who do not praise you … who do praise you.” The existence of a pf. subj. in a nearby hymn, tuṣṭávat in VIII.8.16, also supports a presential interpr. of this pf.

Pāda c contains an ellipsis: we expect an instr. here, as in VIII.1.18 ayā́ vardhasva tanvā̀girā́máma. The appropriate word can either be extracted from the proleptic adj. súṣṭutaḥ “by my (praise) (so that you become) well praised” (as well as the two forms of tuṣṭuvúḥ in ab) or, less likely, pratnéna mánmanā in 11a.
