Geldner explains the form of ajani as “attraction to the simile” (that is, 3rd ps.

instead of 1st ps.), but although obviously there is no 1st sg. passive aorist, if there were to be, this is what it would be. More problematic is the logical connection of ab with c. Geldner thinks that the rebirth is “durch die Erleuchtung”; I assume he means that the acquisition of knowledge and the resulting illumination caused the poet to be reborn like the sun. But the sun is reborn every day, and the passing of knowledge from father to son presumably happens once or a few times at most -- although, if the father is the son’s teacher, it might be a daily event.
