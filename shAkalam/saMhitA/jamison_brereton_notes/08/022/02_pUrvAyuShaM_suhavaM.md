The reading of the first word of this vs. is uncertain. The Saṃhitā text apparently reads pūrvāyúṣam but the Pp. pūrva-āpúṣam, accepted by Sāyaṇa as well as Oldenberg and edited in all the standard editions (MM, Aufr., Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition). This seems to be a genuine variant reading. For disc. see Oldenberg ad loc. and Scarlatta 320-22. I generally follow the Oldenberg analysis for the 2nd member; the objection that with a 2nd member āyuṣ- the accent should be *pūrvā́yuṣam or *pūrvāyuṣám seems cogent to me. But I have not adopted Oldenberg’s suggestion that pūrva- stands for *puru- (hence ‘prospering many’, vel sim.), with the ū introduced under the influence of pū́rvyam at the end of the hemistich. This is not impossible, but since puru-spṛ́ham intervenes, it might have helped maintain an original *puru- in the initial word. Scarlatta suggests several further analyses, which seem too fussy to me.

sacanā́vant- is construed with the instr. sumatíbhiḥ: “provided with favors as accompaniment.”
