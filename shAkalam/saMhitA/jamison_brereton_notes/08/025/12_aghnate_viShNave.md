A verb needs to be supplied for ab to be a clause. On the basis of śrudhí in c, I supply ‘sing’, but any verb of service to a divinity that takes a dative would work. Geldner “serve” (dienen), Renou, somewhat more elaborately “apportons notre prière.” Ideally we would supply sacemahi on the basis of áriṣyantaḥ … sacemahi in 11c, but √sac doesn’t accommodate this case frame. (The few exx. with dat. given by Gr are to be explained otherwise.)
