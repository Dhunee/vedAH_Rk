The lexeme ní √sac is found only here in the RV and indeed, judging from MonWms, in all of Sanskrit. I consider the ní here intrusive, having crept in from passsages like VII.38.3 víśvebhiḥ pātu pāyúbhir ní sūrī́n. The lexeme ní √pā is fairly well attested, and so I think ní has, as it were, hitched a ride on pāyúbhiḥ, which is ordinarily found with a form of the cognate verb as in the just cited passage.

The insistent ní’s of 11c may also have played a part.

This tṛca takes a break from Mitra and Varuṇa, introducing a somewhat random collection of other protective divinities. See also vs. 14.
