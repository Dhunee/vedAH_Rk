The verse begins with a 2nd ps. pronoun túbhyam, and the content of what follows, until the end of b, seems entirely consonant with Indra as the 2nd ps. referent.

However, the vocative closing b, vibhāvaso, otherwise used only of Agni, and the fact that Indra is the 3rd ps. object of the imperative ā́vaha in c, whose subject should be Agni, call the interpretation of the earlier part of the verse into question. Yet it is next to impossible, in my view, that the announcing of the soma drinks in a is made to anyone but Indra, and so we must reckon with a half verse that changed horses in midstream, as it were, without any poetic benefit accruing.

The c pādas of all three verses in this tṛca have the same structure: dat. pl. stotṛ́bhyaḥ, a form of índra- (acc. 25-26, voc. 27), 2nd ps. imperative.
