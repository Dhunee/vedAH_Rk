Again I read the verb ā́… dadhāmi with both pādas, with slightly different senses with the two different objects and with te read as gen. with pāda a and dat. with pāda b.

The c pādas of all three verses in this tṛca have the same structure: dat. pl. stotṛ́bhyaḥ, a form of índra- (acc. 25-26, voc. 27), 2nd ps. imperative.
