Both Geldner and Renou take the hapax avódevam, modifying vácaḥ, as meaning ‘below / inferior to (that of) the gods’. This makes a nice contrast to upárimartyam ‘above (that of) mortals’. However, it otherwise seems an odd sentiment: it is surely a given that anything we mortals produce will be inferior to whatever comes from the gods, but this is a given that we don’t necessarily want to emphasize. In this ritual context the point of our speech is that it should be good enough (better than that of other mortals) to bring the gods to us. Hence something like Grassmann’s “die Götter herunterholend, sie herablockend” seems preferable (see also Kümmel 492). The compound itself is a version of, or manipulation of, the reasonably common expression avó divā́/ diváḥ (I.163.6, V.40.6, VIII.40.8, IX.74.6).

The VP cáno dadhīta “should take delight” takes complements in two different cases (both found independently elsewhere), acc. stómam (11b), havyā́ (11c) and loc. rātíṣu (12b), all connected by vā (11c, 12a). Another ex. of the poets’ enjoyment of syntactically licensed case disharmony.

Note the alliterative v’s of 11c havyā́vā véviṣad víṣah (immediately preceded by 11b … viśvávāryaḥ and immediately followed by 12a víprasya vā …) and of 12d váso vividúṣo vácaḥ.
