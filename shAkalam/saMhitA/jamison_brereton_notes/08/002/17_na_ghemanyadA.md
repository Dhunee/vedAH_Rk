In b I follow a suggestion of Renou’s (EVP 13.98, ad IV.6.4) in interpreting the hapax náviṣṭau as ná *viṣṭaú, with the only emendation the accenting of the second word. Cf. I.92.3 árcanti nā́rīr apáso ná viṣṭíbhiḥ “They chant like women busy with their labors.” Oldenberg explains it rather as a haplology of *návaviṣṭi- ‘new labor’ (also Renou’s 1st suggestion), and he is followed by Geldner “bei der Neuheit des Dichterwerkes,” taking apásaḥ as a gen. sg. But by its accent apásaḥ should mean ‘worker’, not ‘work’. Kümmel (p. 297) also follows Oldenberg, but, taking account of the accent, tr. “beim neuen Wirken des Künstlers.” In the published translation “at their labor” should be preceded by an asterisk.
