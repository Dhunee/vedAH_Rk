This vs. lacks a verb to govern úpastutim. I supply a form of (prá) √bhṛ ‘present, bring’, which takes úpastutim as object elsewhere (+prá IV.56.5, VIII.62.1; simplex I.148.2). There is, unfortunately, no contextual support for it within the hymn, however. Geldner supplies ‘make’, which is not impossible but has no contextual support, and the putative VP úpastutim √kṛ is not otherwise found. Renou’s tr.

“(présenter)” seems to agree with mine, but in his n. he claims to be supplying vocaḥ on the basis of vs. 5 (where the form is actually, per Pp [and most tr., incl. Renou] voce).

Although this contextual support would be good to have, oddly enough no verbs of speaking take úpastuti- as obj. (and, as just noted, Renou’s tr. doesn’t reflect his statement in the n.).
