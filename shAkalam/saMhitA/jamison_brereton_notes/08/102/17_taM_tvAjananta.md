It is not clear who the mothers are and whether they are, with Sāyaṇa, identified with the gods mentioned in pāda b. Renou’s “(tels) des mères” seems to follow this interpr., but in his n. he suggests that the mothers are the waters. The mention of the waters in vs. 14 might support this latter alternative, but given the “three (mothers)” of Agni in the preceding hymn, VIII.101.6, which I take to be the (male) gods Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman (see comm. ad loc.), I am inclined towards Sāyaṇa’s interpr., though it is not clearly reflected in my published translation
