Pāda a can of course be in the acc. (not nom. as I take it) and form a single sentence with b (so Geldner). There are no implications either way, but I prefer to take fronted forms of ayám as annunciatory (“here is …”) if at all possible. However, given initial imā́(5a) and imā́m (6a), which can’t be so tr., this is not a strong arg.

The referent of tásya in the refrain pāda is not specified. It must fall into the cultic sphere, but could be ‘sacrifice’ or ‘hymn’ or, perhaps best, since it’s explicit in a nearby hymn by the same poet, ‘call’: VIII.35.4 bódhataṃ hávasya me.
