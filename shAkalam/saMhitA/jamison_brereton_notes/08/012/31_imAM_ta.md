Pāda c presents some difficulties of interpretation, in particular how to distribute the three accusatives jāmím, padā́, and pípratīm. The last, a participle, takes padám as object in IX.10.7 (adduced by both Oldenberg and Geldner): padám ékasya píprataḥ “guiding the track of the lone one safely across.” But it also takes personal objects, as in nearby VIII.6.2 prajā́m rtásya p ̥ íprataḥ “guiding the child of truth [=poem] safely across.” I therefore take it as a semantically mixed construction, with jāmím ‘kin’ (which in this case, as in VIII.6.2, would be a poem or hymn) in the frame and ‘footsteps’ in the simile. By contrast, Geldner takes jāmím as the subject of the simile, parallel to suṣṭutím: “die wie eine Schwester deine Schritte geleitet.” His interpretation reads better, but ignores the position of iva and also the contrasting constructions of the participle píprat- elsewhere. By my interpretation the point is that the suṣṭutí- produced in ab takes the rest of the verbal portion of the sacrifice along with it to the god.

I take the refrain prā́dhvaré as a (quasi) locative absolute, as in VIII.46.18, rather than as integrated into what precedes.

This tṛca is unified by the 4-syllable pāda prā́dhvaré. This pāda appears also in VIII.46.18 and IX.102.8, always as the final pāda of Uṣṇih (or the equivalent: in 46.18 Upariṣṭādbṛhatī). I interpr. it in the context of the fairly frequent fuller expression prayaty àdhvaré, a loc. absol. meaning “while the ceremony is proceeding,” which is esp. common in VIII: I.16.3 = VIII.3.5, V.28.6 = VIII.71.12, VIII.7.6, VIII.13.30, X.21.6; cf. also VI.10.1). I take prā́dhvaré as a truncated version of this loc. absol. and tr. it “while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).”
