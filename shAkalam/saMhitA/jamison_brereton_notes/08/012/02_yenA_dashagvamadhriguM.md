Unlike Geldner I take svàrṇara- here as an epithet of Adhrigu, rather than a PN (sim. VIII.3.12), though not on strong grounds, and VIII.6.39, where I do take it as a PN, undercuts this position.

Either Adhrigu or, if he is a personage, Svarṇara receives the qualifier vepáyant- ‘setting atremble’, without an object. Given how little we know about Adhrigu (or Svarṇara), it is not clear what such an object might be, though it might refer to poetic inspiration.

This tṛca is unified by a series of relative clauses (mostly introduced by yéna) whose antecedent in the main clause is the tám that opens the refrain. The presumed referent of all the relative pronouns (and the tám’s) is mádaḥ in 1b, although it could be any power or capacity of Indra’s that comes to mind.
