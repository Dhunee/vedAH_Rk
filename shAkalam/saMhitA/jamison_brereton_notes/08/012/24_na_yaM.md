Note the slight variation on the refrain: abl. ójasaḥ, parallel to abl. ámāt in b, versus 22-23 dat. ójase.

Geldner supplies “the world” (extracted from the dual of a) as subject of titviṣe in c.

I follow Oldenberg in taking Indra as subject, with the asya reflexive. As Oldenberg points out, in nearby VIII.6.5 it is Indra’s ójas- that is subject of the same verb; here the attribute has been deflected to an oblique case and the god himself is subject. Note also X.55.1, where Indra is modified by the participle titviṣānáḥ.
