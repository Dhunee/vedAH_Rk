This tṛca is unified by the 4-syllable pāda prā́dhvaré. This pāda appears also in VIII.46.18 and IX.102.8, always as the final pāda of Uṣṇih (or the equivalent: in 46.18 Upariṣṭādbṛhatī). I interpr. it in the context of the fairly frequent fuller expression prayaty àdhvaré, a loc. absol. meaning “while the ceremony is proceeding,” which is esp. common in VIII: I.16.3 = VIII.3.5, V.28.6 = VIII.71.12, VIII.7.6, VIII.13.30, X.21.6; cf. also VI.10.1). I take prā́dhvaré as a truncated version of this loc. absol. and tr. it “while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).”
