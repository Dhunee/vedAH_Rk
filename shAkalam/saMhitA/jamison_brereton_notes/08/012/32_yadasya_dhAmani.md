Contrary to Geldner, I take pāda c as part of the subordinate clause of ab, with vs. 33 the main clause. Geldner is forced to supply a verb (“geht”).

dohánā is the problem here. Grassmann suggests we read it as underlying dohánās as in I.144.2, despite the sandhi. This seems to be the basis of Geldner’s interpretation (“die Melkung” as subject), but Oldenberg rejects this and takes it as an instrumental. I weakly follow Oldenberg, but neither of the interpretations is particularly compelling.
