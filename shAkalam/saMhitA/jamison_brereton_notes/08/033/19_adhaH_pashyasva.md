The poet returns in his own voice to mock the new model, by imitating in the first three pādas the speech of a mother to her little daughter, inculcating proper behavior. kaśaplakaú in c is a hapax, but its -ka- suffix suggests that it belongs to a low register (note also pādakaú in b) and the fact that it is in the dual limits its possible applications. Oldenberg suggests “weibl. Geschlechsteile” (though he moves on to breasts), and the fact that keeping one’s feet together keeps them from being seen makes the labia a good possibility.

The poet then unleashes a devastating insult on his addressee, a brahman - that he has turned into a woman. I take this unfortunate figure to be the ritualist favoring the new model, and our poet is suggesting that too much association with and sympathy for women, too much emphasis on equality, will unman a man.

As discussed in the published introduction, in my view this strange pendant to the hymn is an oblique attack on what I consider a late RVic ritual innovation, the introduction of the Patnī, Sacrificer’s Wife, as a required role in standard ritual. For both general discussion of this situation and some detailed consideration of passages throughout the RV, including this one, that fight this doctrinal battle, see Jamison 2011 “The Secret Lives of Texts” (Presidential Address, American Oriental Society 2010; JAOS 131: 1-7) and “‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?” (Brereton and Proferes, eds., Creating the Veda, Living the Veda: Selected Papers from the 13th World Sanskrit Conference, 19-30). The division of speakers, again in my view, is that the poet, who opposes the new ritual model, speaks the first (16) and last (19) verses, while 17-18 are put in the mouth of Indra, who is a proponent.

These verses are extensively discussed by Oldenberg and Geldner, with Oldenberg somewhat more in line with my own interpretation; I will not consistently signal my agreements and disagreements with them in what follows.
