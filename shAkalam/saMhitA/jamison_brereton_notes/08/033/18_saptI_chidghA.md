In my interpretation Indra’s speech continues here, and having admitted the drawbacks to employing women in the ritual, he introduces the model of the yoked pair (that is, the married couple) drawing the chariot of sacrifice, a pair that must be more or less equally matched, but with the pole of the male somewhat higher than that of the female. (Some animals are more equal than others.) The image of the sacrifice as a chariot is of course a common one, and the word mithunā́ ‘complementary pair, sexual pair’ seems to me the tipoff that this is about the married couple. (Oldenberg is in general agreement.)

As discussed in the published introduction, in my view this strange pendant to the hymn is an oblique attack on what I consider a late RVic ritual innovation, the introduction of the Patnī, Sacrificer’s Wife, as a required role in standard ritual. For both general discussion of this situation and some detailed consideration of passages throughout the RV, including this one, that fight this doctrinal battle, see Jamison 2011 “The Secret Lives of Texts” (Presidential Address, American Oriental Society 2010; JAOS 131: 1-7) and “‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?” (Brereton and Proferes, eds., Creating the Veda, Living the Veda: Selected Papers from the 13th World Sanskrit Conference, 19-30). The division of speakers, again in my view, is that the poet, who opposes the new ritual model, speaks the first (16) and last (19) verses, while 17-18 are put in the mouth of Indra, who is a proponent.

These verses are extensively discussed by Oldenberg and Geldner, with Oldenberg somewhat more in line with my own interpretation; I will not consistently signal my agreements and disagreements with them in what follows.
