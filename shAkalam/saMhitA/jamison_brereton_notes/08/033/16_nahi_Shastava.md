I take the disgruntled speaker to be the poet and the subject of ráṇyati to be a rival ritualist, who has accepted the new doctrine. The “you or me” of pāda a is rather like the English expression “the likes of you and me,” meaning “ordinary people.” I take the nahí … nó (= ná u) as having domain only over táva and máma, not the anyásya of pāda b. By my rules (Jamison 1997) anyá- in this position should be definite (not Geldner’s indefinite “oder eines anderen…”), and I take its referent to be Indra. The referent of the yáḥ in the rel. clause in c I again take to be Indra (that is, anyásya), rather than the subject of ráṇyati, as Geldner does. The designation vīrá- is of course regularly applied to Indra, and “led us here” can refer both to Indra’s leadership in the acquisition of new territory and to his role in introducing the ritual innovation. And Indra starts off the next verse.

As discussed in the published introduction, in my view this strange pendant to the hymn is an oblique attack on what I consider a late RVic ritual innovation, the introduction of the Patnī, Sacrificer’s Wife, as a required role in standard ritual. For both general discussion of this situation and some detailed consideration of passages throughout the RV, including this one, that fight this doctrinal battle, see Jamison 2011 “The Secret Lives of Texts” (Presidential Address, American Oriental Society 2010; JAOS 131: 1-7) and “‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?” (Brereton and Proferes, eds., Creating the Veda, Living the Veda: Selected Papers from the 13th World Sanskrit Conference, 19-30). The division of speakers, again in my view, is that the poet, who opposes the new ritual model, speaks the first (16) and last (19) verses, while 17-18 are put in the mouth of Indra, who is a proponent.

These verses are extensively discussed by Oldenberg and Geldner, with Oldenberg somewhat more in line with my own interpretation; I will not consistently signal my agreements and disagreements with them in what follows.
