As noted in the published introduction, Agni is repeatedly referred to as both ‘inspired poet’ (vípra-) and ‘sage poet’ (kaví-) in this hymn, sometimes with the words in the same vs. (12, 21). Here -vépas-, belonging to the root of vípra-, √vip ‘tremble, become inspired’, co-occurs with kaví-, filling the contrastive vípra- role.
