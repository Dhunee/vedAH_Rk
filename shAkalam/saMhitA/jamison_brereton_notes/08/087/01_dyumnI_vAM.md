On the difficult word krívi-, see comm. ad I.30.1. Though krívi- is found in a discouraging variety of contexts, our passage is similar to I.30.1, in that the root √sic ‘pour’ is associated with it.

This verse modulates rather cleverly from praise for the Aśvins (stómaḥ, pāda a) to pressed soma for them (mádhvaḥ sutásya, pāda c), pivoting on séke ‘at its outpouring’, which is literally applicable to the soma but, as is well known, metaphorically applicable to the praise.

The d pādas of these two vss. apparently begin with the same verb: 1d pātám, 2d ní pātam, but these two almost certainly belong to the two homonymous roots √pā ‘drink’ and √pā ‘protect’ respectively, pace Geldner Renou’s arg. that the latter belongs to ‘protect’ seems pretty decisive: ni √pā ‘drink’ is not found till the Rām., whereas ní √pā ‘protect’ is quite well attested in the RV. I imagine the poet signaled the change of root by including this preverb while enjoying the etymological play (see also píbatam beginning 2a, 4a, as well as pātam 5d).
