However odd the expression drapsā́ḥ … dhámanti “the droplets blow their blast” may seem, it is found twice elsewhere: the extremely enigmatic VIII.96.13 and the somewhat clearer IX.73.1. The latter is a noise-making context, as this may be.

16c útsaṃ duhántaḥ reprises 10bc duduhré … útsam, which in turn reminded us of dhukṣánta in 3c. Other elements in vs. 3 reappear in vs. 17: pṛ́śnimātaraḥ in 17c was the subj. of dhukṣánta in 3b, and 17ab úd u … īrate … úd u vāyúbhiḥ reminds us of 3a úd īrayanta vāyúbhiḥ (cf. also 7ab).

On svānébhiḥ in 17a see comm. on 14. Because vss. 16 and 17 are so closely tied, I connect the drapsá- of 16a with the svānébhiḥ in 17a and consider this a variant of svānaíḥ … índubhiḥ in 14c.
