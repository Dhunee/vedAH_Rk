On anāha see Kümmel’s length and useful disc. (289). Flg. Oldenberg (accepted by Kümmel), I take it as a 3rd sg., not 2nd pl. with Geldner, Renou The nom. pl. imé … pītā́yaśása uruṣyávaḥ of pāda a is (silently) resumed by sg. “soma.” In order to demonstrate the change in number of the subject, my tr. appears to treat pāda a as a separate clause, which of course it is not. Among other things, the mā in Wackernagel’s Position in a is the obj. of sám anāha in b.

Like 2a this hemistich is a paradox: the soma drops “seeking wide space” nonetheless tie the drinker together.
