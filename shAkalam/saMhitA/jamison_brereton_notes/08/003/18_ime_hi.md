Most assign vāvaśúḥ to √vaś ‘desire’ (e.g., Geldner “diese deine Dichter … verlangen…”; so also Grassmann, Lubotsky), but I take it to √vāś ‘bellow’. Kümmel (477-80) allows both possibilities, though he argues that the original affiliation of the pf. stem vāvaśwas to √vāś, though it may have become partially co-opted by √vaś by semantic overlap. I have opted for √vāś because this hymn contains a number of instances of noise-making by poets or their substitutes: 3d abhí … anūṣata, 7c sám asvaran, 16d asvaran, in addition to the usual verbs of singing and praising. Notice also the very parallel 5cd ... havāmahe ... dhánasya sātáye, with a verb of calling and X sātáye.
