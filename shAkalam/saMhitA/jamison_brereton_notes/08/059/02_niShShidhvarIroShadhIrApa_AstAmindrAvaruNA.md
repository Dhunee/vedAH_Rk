The Khila ābhyām should be read for āstām.

pāré can be read with both genitives, rájasaḥ and ádhvanaḥ, separately (so also Geldner) and is positioned between them.

Despite the morphological peculiarity of sísratuḥ (on which see Oldenberg, Narten [see Kümmel’s ref.], Kümmel 553), I see no reason to substitute the Khila tasthátuḥ with Oldenberg, Geldner Both Narten and Kümmel endorse the nonce form sísratuḥ.
