vadhúmant- means literally ‘having women, brides’, but Geldner raises the question whether in this context it really refers to mares. I think this unlikely.

Dānastutis regularly lump horses and female humans together. Very parallel is I.126.3 śyāvāḥ ... vadhū́mantaḥ ... ráthāsaḥ, “dusky (horses) and chariots carrying brides.”

The donors of the various gifts are generally in the locative here and so would be properly translated “bei,” “chez,” “at (the hands of) …” or the like, but a series of locatival tr. is simply too heavy and awkward.
