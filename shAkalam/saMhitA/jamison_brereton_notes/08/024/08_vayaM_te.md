The opening word of c, váso, is read as vásoḥ by the Pp., followed by Oldenberg and Geldner - that is, with the loss of underlying final -s before the cluster sp- -- hence a gen. sg. belonging with the long gen. sg. noun phrase ending with rā́dhasaḥ. This is of course possible, but the presence of undoubted voc. vaso in 7c in a hymn that is over-partial to vocatives and given to repetitions across verses, supports a voc. interpretation here.
