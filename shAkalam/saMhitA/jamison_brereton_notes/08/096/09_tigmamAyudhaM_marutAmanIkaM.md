However tempting it might be, the juxtaposed phrase ásurā adevā́ḥ is most likely not to be interpreted as an early instantiation of the Asura/Deva conflict of middle Vedic times. Instead it probably refers to human or semi-divine lords (for the former see W. E. Hale, 1986: 83) who do not have the gods on their side. Hale points out that adevá- is the only form in the RV so accented (contrasting with ádeva-), and it must be a bahuvrīhi meaning “not having gods, without gods.”

The da capo-like structure of the verses in this tṛca, with the first pāda repeated verbatim as the last one, is quite unusual.
