The ca in c is one of the rare examples of subordinating ca in the RV, as shown by the accent induced on the verb vavártat; see Klein DGRV I.240-41. Its position, about which Klein does not comment, is peculiar, but it can probably be accounted for metrically. In this particular Atijagatī line (13 syl.), there is a natural break after the first two words (5 syllables), máṃhiṣṭho gīrbhír, and the rest of the line behaves as if it were a dimeter (8-syl.) line, ā́ca yajñíyo vavártat, with initial preverb followed by the enclitic conjunction.

As indicated in the introduction, the identity of the ‘droplet’ (drapsá-) and the purport of this tṛca are quite unclear. Geldner takes both drapsá- and kṛṣṇá- (‘black’) as PNs and the tṛca as their “saga.” Since such a saga is otherwise unknown and both words have lexical meaning, such an approach does not seem to gain us much. 

Oldenberg’s discussion is, as usual, very sharp, but his own interpretation, that Indra is helping an embryonic version of Bṛhaspati, in the form of a drop of semen, to come to birth, also does not convince. 

Schmidt (1968: 112-13) rejects Oldenberg’s interpretation and suggests that it describes in mystical fashion the freeing of the soma-drop in the form of the sun, but declines to tr. the tṛca because of the many uncertainties. 

I am inclined to see it as a treatment of the ritual step of rinsing the soma in water, as I said in the published introduction, though much remains murky.
