“The distillate of all mother’s milk” for viśvápsnya- assumes the etymological connection between -psnya- and stána- ‘breast’, which is now standard doctrine. See EWA s.v. stána-.

Both Lüders (Var. 20, 506) and Schlerath (Kö. 139) consider this sequence to be a satyakriya. I can see the point, but if it is a truth-formulation, it is a muted one. The concept is clearest in 15a “Let this truth be protective of me,” esp. since this is the last verse of the hymn. The truth-formulation itself could be either the preceding verse (so Lüders) or the whole hymn (Schlerath allows both possibilities). In the absence of the standard instrumental ṛtéṇa (later satyena) that signals a satyakriya I am reluctant to label it as such, though certainly it is akin.

Schlerath also point out that the last word of the hymn is rājan.

As indicated in the introduction, the identity of the ‘droplet’ (drapsá-) and the purport of this tṛca are quite unclear. Geldner takes both drapsá- and kṛṣṇá- (‘black’) as PNs and the tṛca as their “saga.” Since such a saga is otherwise unknown and both words have lexical meaning, such an approach does not seem to gain us much. 

Oldenberg’s discussion is, as usual, very sharp, but his own interpretation, that Indra is helping an embryonic version of Bṛhaspati, in the form of a drop of semen, to come to birth, also does not convince. 

Schmidt (1968: 112-13) rejects Oldenberg’s interpretation and suggests that it describes in mystical fashion the freeing of the soma-drop in the form of the sun, but declines to tr. the tṛca because of the many uncertainties. 

I am inclined to see it as a treatment of the ritual step of rinsing the soma in water, as I said in the published introduction, though much remains murky.
