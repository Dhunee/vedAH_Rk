I have chosen to read the impv. bhávā in b with the two small clauses in c as well, though it is certainly possible to interpret those with Geldner as straight indicative nominal clauses: “you (are) there with help …; you (are) friendship …”

The da capo-like structure of the verses in this tṛca, with the first pāda repeated verbatim as the last one, is quite unusual.
