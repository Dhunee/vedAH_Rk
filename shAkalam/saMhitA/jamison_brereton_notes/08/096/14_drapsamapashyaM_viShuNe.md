The final word in a, enā, is taken as enāḥ by the Pp., a reading followed by Grassmann, Geldner, Oldenberg, and Lubotsky; in this interpretation it modifies or doubles (since ena- is a pronominal, not an adjectival demonstrative stem) fem. acc. pl. púraḥ earlier in the pāda. I do not rule this out, but wonder whether it can be the enclitic instr. sg. enā to ayám in the meaning ‘in that way, i.e., how’. See enā ‘thereby’ in V.2.11, in addition to personal uses (‘with him’) in IX.96.2, X.108.3.

Pāda b collects several words that have been prominent in the characterization of Indra earlier in the hymn: ójasā (ójiṣṭham 10d), śaviṣṭha (śavasas pate 6b, śávasā 9c), and śakra (śakra 4a). It is esp. clever that the grammatical identities of the first two terms have been switched: s-stem instr. to superlative and vice versa.

Note that though cd forms a single clause with two different subjects (“all the worlds” and “heaven and earth”), the dual verb rejete agrees with the nearer one, the decomposed dual dvandva dyā́vā … pṛthivī́ca.

Both Lüders (Var. 20, 506) and Schlerath (Kö. 139) consider this sequence to be a satyakriya. I can see the point, but if it is a truth-formulation, it is a muted one. The concept is clearest in 15a “Let this truth be protective of me,” esp. since this is the last verse of the hymn. The truth-formulation itself could be either the preceding verse (so Lüders) or the whole hymn (Schlerath allows both possibilities). In the absence of the standard instrumental ṛtéṇa (later satyena) that signals a satyakriya I am reluctant to label it as such, though certainly it is akin.

Schlerath also point out that the last word of the hymn is rājan.

As indicated in the introduction, the identity of the ‘droplet’ (drapsá-) and the purport of this tṛca are quite unclear. Geldner takes both drapsá- and kṛṣṇá- (‘black’) as PNs and the tṛca as their “saga.” Since such a saga is otherwise unknown and both words have lexical meaning, such an approach does not seem to gain us much. 

Oldenberg’s discussion is, as usual, very sharp, but his own interpretation, that Indra is helping an embryonic version of Bṛhaspati, in the form of a drop of semen, to come to birth, also does not convince. 

Schmidt (1968: 112-13) rejects Oldenberg’s interpretation and suggests that it describes in mystical fashion the freeing of the soma-drop in the form of the sun, but declines to tr. the tṛca because of the many uncertainties. 

I am inclined to see it as a treatment of the ritual step of rinsing the soma in water, as I said in the published introduction, though much remains murky.
