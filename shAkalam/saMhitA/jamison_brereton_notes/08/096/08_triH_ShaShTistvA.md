Although the med. pf. of √vṛdh is ordinarily intransitive or reflexive, vāvṛdhānā́ḥ is here best interpreted as transitive in the frame (“increasing you,” with tvā in a as obj.) but intransitive in the simile (“as ruddy throngs increase,” with the nominative NP usrā́iva rāśáyaḥ). See X.78.8 for a similar example of case disharmony.

The da capo-like structure of the verses in this tṛca, with the first pāda repeated verbatim as the last one, is quite unusual.
