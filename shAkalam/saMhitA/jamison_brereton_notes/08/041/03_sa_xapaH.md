I don’t understand the purport of this vs., esp. de. Geldner and Renou suggest various possible referents for the vénīḥ and for the three dawns, all possible and none particularly compelling.

I supply sasvaje with the pári in c, on the basis of pári ṣasvaje in a. Geldner and Renou construe the pāda without a verb (e.g., Geldner: “er ist rings um die Welt sichtbar”). This is possible.
