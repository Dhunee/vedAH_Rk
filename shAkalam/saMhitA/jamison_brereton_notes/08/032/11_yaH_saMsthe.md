A novel construction, at least as interpreted by Geldner (fld. by Klein and accepted also by me). The word -kratu- ‘intention, resolve’ is extracted from Indra’s epithet śatá-kratu- and implicitly made object of kṛnóti, represented by the enclitic pronoun īm. See Geldner’s “der … hundertfach Rat weiss und ihn ausführt.”
