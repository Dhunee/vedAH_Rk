Again the uncertainty about whether Indra will pay attention to their praise gives a slightly nervous air to the beginning of this verse. In the 2nd pāda the full form of ‘our’ (asmā́kam) is fronted; a tr. better reflecting this emphasis and in harmony with the poets’ anxieties about Indra’s attention would be “let it be our (soma-)drops that invigorate Indra…” Cf. 3cd.

Note the concentration of nominal forms of the root √stu ‘praise’ in these verses: stómam 14d, 15a, sadhástutim 16a, úpastutiḥ 16c, suṣṭutím 16d. The appearance of sómam in 17a signals a sort of ring-composition by variant, echoing the two forms of stómam in successive pādas of 14 and 15.
