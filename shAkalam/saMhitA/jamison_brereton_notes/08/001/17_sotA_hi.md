Because dhāvata in b is unaccented, it cannot be directly parallel with sótā in pāda a, as, e.g., Geldner takes it, because the hí of pāda a should then have domain over b and induce accent on the verb. I take the hí clause as indicating the grounds or prior action needed for the next clause, as so often when hí appears with the imperative (see Brereton 2012). It is also possible that sótā is an injunctive, though clear impv.

sotā in 19b disfavors this interpretation.

On the īm enam doubling see Jamison 2002.

In c I take gavyā́as part of the frame, not the simile, because of the position of iva. Contra Geldner, who takes gavyā́vástrā as the simile: “[g]leichsam in Milchgewänder…” dhukṣan should be an injunctive to the sa-aorist found in ádhukṣat, etc., the only reliably attested sigmatic aorist to √duh. It would be appealing to interpret it as a subjunctive to an athematic s-aorist (as the pub tr. “will milk”and Geldner’s “wollen … herausmelken” suggest), but it should then have full-grade *dhokṣan.

On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.

Note the concentration of nominal forms of the root √stu ‘praise’ in these verses: stómam 14d, 15a, sadhástutim 16a, úpastutiḥ 16c, suṣṭutím 16d. The appearance of sómam in 17a signals a sort of ring-composition by variant, echoing the two forms of stómam in successive pādas of 14 and 15.
