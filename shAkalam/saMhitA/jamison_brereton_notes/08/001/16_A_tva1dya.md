The phraseology of this verse echoes some previous ones: its opening ā́tv àdyá is identical to 10a, and vāvā́tar- ‘favorite’ occurs in the RV only here and in 8b (in the same position).

Note the concentration of nominal forms of the root √stu ‘praise’ in these verses: stómam 14d, 15a, sadhástutim 16a, úpastutiḥ 16c, suṣṭutím 16d. The appearance of sómam in 17a signals a sort of ring-composition by variant, echoing the two forms of stómam in successive pādas of 14 and 15.
