Although the primary sense of d, “take delight in your praise,” is surely that the poets will enjoy praising Indra, in the context of these two verses it presumably also implies that they will take delight because their praise will put them (back?) into Indra’s good graces and thereby improve their own view of themselves and their chances of making good.

Note the concentration of nominal forms of the root √stu ‘praise’ in these verses: stómam 14d, 15a, sadhástutim 16a, úpastutiḥ 16c, suṣṭutím 16d. The appearance of sómam in 17a signals a sort of ring-composition by variant, echoing the two forms of stómam in successive pādas of 14 and 15.
