Note the three compounds beginning with puru- in ab.

I emend the accented nom. káṇvāsaḥ to accentless *kaṇvāsaḥ, thus avoiding the awk. “I shall praise (and also) the Kāṇvas (shall praise)” (so Renou), or the necessity of taking stuṣé as an infinitive. Nearby VIII.7.32 has #káṇvāsaḥ ... /#stuṣé ..., with a pāda-init. accented voc. káṇvāsaḥ (cf. also VIII.2.38, and with nom. VIII.4.2, VIII.6.31), and the accent here may have been acquired redactionally on these models. By my interpr. “I” (the poet, who is himself a Kāṇva) announces to his fellow Kāṇvas that he is invoking the Aśvins “for our help” (na ūtáye); the 1st pl.

enclitic naḥ encompasses the poet himself and those addressed in the voc.

Both these vss., though not belonging to the same tṛca, most likely contain 1st sg. -se forms.
