For the odd sentiments of this verse and what follows, see the introduction. Both Geldner and Oldenberg supply an object to the first verb (dadhiṣe), an object drawn from ritual (Geldner “das Opfer,” Oldenberg “Lob u. degl., Somatränke”), but this seems unduly restrictive.

I think that the poet is apprehensive about the consequences of whatever Indra might undertake.
