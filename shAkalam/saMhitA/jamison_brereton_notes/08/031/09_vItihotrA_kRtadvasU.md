With Geldner and Renou, I take pāda c as referring to sex, though in a devotional context (Geldner: “Kinderzeugung als verdienstliches Werk”). The point of the Agastya and Lopāmudrā hymn I.179, already cited ad vs. 6, is of course that ascetic practice must yield to sex as a duty even for the very devout.
