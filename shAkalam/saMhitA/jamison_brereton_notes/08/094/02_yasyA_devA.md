Curiously, vratā́… dhāráyante seems to be the only full VP with vratá- as obj. of a verbal form of √dhṛ, despite the common (nearly 20x) bahuvrīhi dhṛtávrata- ‘whose commandments are upheld’.

There are several ways to construe the dual dvandva sū́ryāmā́sā of c. Geldner takes it as a separate obj. of dhāráyante, Renou as an additional subj. of the same verb, while I take it as the subj. of the purpose inf. dṛśé.
