Geldner (followed by Klein, DGRV I.242, II.108) takes pāda c as a subordinated conditional clause with d, with the subordination marked by ca (i.e., “if you will be my comrade, then we will …”). This is certainly possible, but it is impossible to tell formally if c is subordinated to d or coordinated with b (as I take it) because the accent on the verb ásaḥ can result from its initial position. Perhaps in favor of the Geldner/Klein interpretation is the fact that both c and d contain subjunctives, while b has an imperative. On the other hand, in a related passage (also adduced by Geldner), the two expressions are parallel, not in a subordinate/main clause relation: X.83.7 … dakṣiṇató bhavā me, ádhā vṛtrā́ṇi jaṅghanāva bhū́ri “Be on my right side.

Then we two will keep smiting obstacles in abundance.”

As I argue in the published introduction, the heavy emphasis on Indra’s designating a portion of soma at the beginning of the sacrifice for “you,” the speaker of vs. 1, points strongly at Vāyu as this speaker, rather than Viṣṇu, as Geldner suggests.

Oldenberg also considers it an Indra-Vāyu dialogue.
