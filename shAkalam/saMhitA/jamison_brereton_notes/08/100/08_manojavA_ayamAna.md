The stealing of the soma treated here logically precedes the outcome of the Vṛtra battle treated in 7 and 9, since Indra needed to drink the soma in order to fight Vṛtra, as is well known. I suggest that the theft is intercalated here, between two hemistichs about the vájra- (7cd, 9ab), not only because Rigvedic narratives are famously shattered chronologically, but also to play a trick. The vajrá- was let fly (a in 7d (apīpatat); in the next half-verse (8ab) the unspecified subject goes at the speed of thought. The default assumption would be that it is the flying mace, but cd disappoints our expectations by introducing the bird and the familiar soma-theft.

I take these three Anuṣṭubh verses as the singer’s performance of the recital of deeds promised in 6ab, but cast in the language of dramatic immediacy - almost “you are there” - with the singer himself as the supposed witness, addressing the waters in 7ab. Geldner (in his introduction.) also seems to assign the verses to the singer, while Oldenberg (1885: 57 n. 2) refuses to speculate.
