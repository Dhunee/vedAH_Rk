I take dī́dharaḥ as the subjunctive of the redupl. aor., whose indicative forms are generally athematic (dīdhar, etc., though cf. augmented thematic ádīdharat in the very late hymn X.173.3). The sequence yadā́… dī́dharaḥ …, ā́d íd … kṛṇavaḥ with aorist subjunctive in the protasis and present subjunctive in the apodosis seems a rough-and-ready attempt to express anteriority (“when you will [have] …, only after that will you …”) in a language that does not, as far as I can see, have either a formalized system of sequence of tense in conditionals or a standard way to express anteriority with finite verb forms (as opposed to participles and, somewhat later, the gerund).

As I argue in the published introduction, the heavy emphasis on Indra’s designating a portion of soma at the beginning of the sacrifice for “you,” the speaker of vs. 1, points strongly at Vāyu as this speaker, rather than Viṣṇu, as Geldner suggests.

Oldenberg also considers it an Indra-Vāyu dialogue.
