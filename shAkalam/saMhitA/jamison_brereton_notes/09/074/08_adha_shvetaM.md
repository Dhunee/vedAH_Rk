This is the triumphant realization of the quest set in motion in vs. 1. The race horse (vājī́) of 1b reappears here having won (sasavā́n) at the finish line (kā́rṣman) what it was seeking to win (síṣāsati) there - namely the milk, here given a very full expression: śvetáṃ [recurring from 7a] kaláśaṃ góbhir aktám “the gleaming white tub anointed with cows.” This first hemistich plus pāda c is the actual end of the hymn, and so this successful resolution of vs. 1 provides a thematic ring. Pāda c reintroduces the human ritual personnel, who propel Soma in his guise as racehorse—thus allowing the priest-poets to take some credit for the successful conclusion of the sacrifice, after having been shut out for most of the hymn. Pāda d is a snatch of a dānastuti, and vs. 9 seems an afterthought tacked onto the hymn. Or such is my analysis; most of the other tr. attempt to link the second hemistich with the first, syntactically and thematically. Most radically Geldner (fld. by Doniger), who makes d dependent on sasavā́n in b, with c a parenthetical intrusion. Maurer, by contrast, makes d the obj.

of c, which does less violence to the order of elements but is still, to my mind, unsatisfactory. Among other things soma is the usual object of √hi in IX, which contains multiple exx., and so making the cows (somehow) the object violates formulaic expectations. Cf. esp. IX.106.11 hinvanti vājínam, with soma identified as a vājín as here.

It is easy to understand the attempts of others to link d with something else in the vs., because it consists only of a dative phrase (kakṣī́vate śatáhimāya) and a gen. pl. (gónām). However, as I just remarked, this pāda seems to be an abbreviated dānastuti, with the dāna specified and no stuti given, but the poet and would-be recipient emphatically named. In such circumstances condensed phraseology is not surprising. Geldner appositely cites as parallel I.126.2 śatáṃ kakṣī́vān ásurasya gónām “A hundred cows of the lord (have I,) Kakṣīvant, (taken).” In our passage the “hundred” is cleverly tucked into the adj. śatáhima-, which otherwise presumably expresses Kakṣīvant’s proleptic wish for a 100-year lifespan; it seems unlikely that he is already that old.

These two vss. seem to resolve the situation set up in vs. 1, esp. 1bc: the racehorse that was striving to win the sun (=milk) there (1b) has achieved this goal and “keeps company” with ritual speech and labor, as it did in 1c (and 5a) with more physical features of the ritual process. The repetition of the desid. síṣāsati from 1b in 7a and the resolution of the desid. into an achieved state via a pf. part. sasavā́n (8b) signal the relationship between vss. 1 and 7-8 - as does the repetition of sacate from 1c (/sácamānaḥ 5a) in 7c.
