The metaphorical universe of the soma hymns makes it difficult to interpr. the phrase ghṛtám páyaḥ, lit. “ghee (and) milk.” In the published translation I take the phrase as the ultimate goal of pári srava, referring to the milk with which the soma will be mixed after its trip across the filter. See the esp. explicit IX.31.5 túbhyaṃ gā́vo ghṛtám páyah … dudhré “For you the cows have milked out ghee and milk,” which identifies the phrase as referring to substance(s) that the cows produce for soma, real dairy products. But soma is also sometimes compared to milk and to ghee (e.g., IX.74.4), and so the phrase can also be an appositive metaphorically characterizing the subject soma, accounting for Geldner’s “Laufe du … als Schmalz und Milch.” However, our 5c svádanti gā́vo páyobhiḥ “the cows sweeten (soma) with their milk” suggests that the milk and ghee in this vs. are likewise firmly bovine

- though see 20b below.

The tṛca shows no strong signs of internal unity, save for the “sitting” found in both 7 and 8, but it does echo some of the material earlier in the hymn: ásṛgram in 7b matches the same verb in 1a; ā́sadaḥ in 7c recalls ā́sadat in 4c, while sī́dan yónā (8c) is a different echo of 4c yónim ā́sadat; arṣa (8a) picks up arṣanti (3b); svā́diṣṭhaḥ in 9b expresses the result of svádanti in 5c; and varivo-víd in 9c is a paraphrase of kṛṇvánto várivaḥ in 2c. It may also be worth noting that this is the first place in the hymn that the divine recipients of soma are mentioned: índrāya 8a, áṅgirobhyaḥ 9b.
