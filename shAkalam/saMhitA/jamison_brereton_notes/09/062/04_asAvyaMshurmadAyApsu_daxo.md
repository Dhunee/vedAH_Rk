As in IX.61.18 I take dákṣa- adjectivally (so also Geldner, Renou); even more than in that passage, a noun interpr. is difficult: “… the skill, abiding on a mountain”? The loc. apsú and the locativally used stem giri- implicitly contrast.

Again no obvious signs of unity, beyond the progress through the preparation of soma. Note, however, that 4b and 5b both begin apsú and the opening of 6b, áśū(śubhan) echoes that opening phonologically.
