The fluent Engl. of the tr. conceals a syntactic problem: soma should be the obj. of the verb svádanti in c, and the first pāda, which is entirely in the neuter, with the NP led by ándhas-, allows such an acc. interpr. However, the intermediate pāda (b) is stubbornly in the masc. nominative (dhūtáḥ … sutáḥ). We must either take b as a parenthetical nominal clause, as Geldner and I do, or take ab as entirely in the nominative (as Renou may do - his structure is not entirely clear) as a separate nominal clause, and supply a resumptive pronominal acc. for c.

Again no obvious signs of unity, beyond the progress through the preparation of soma. Note, however, that 4b and 5b both begin apsú and the opening of 6b, áśū(śubhan) echoes that opening phonologically.
