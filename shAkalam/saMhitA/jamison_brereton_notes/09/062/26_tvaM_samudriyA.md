Because of the accentual difference between vācáḥ in 25a and vā́caḥ in 26b, we must construe the two superficially near-identical phrases vācó agriyáḥ and agriyó vā́caḥ quite differently. The first is a single constituent with dependent gen. vācáḥ, but in the 2nd agriyáḥ and acc pl. vā́caḥ belong to different constituents, despite their adjacency: vā́caḥ is the (or rather, an) obj. of īráyan.

This tṛca shows more signs of unity than others in this hymn, esp. in the 1st two vss. Both 25 and 26 contain pāda-initial pávasva (25a, 26c) and the variant phrases vācó agriyáḥ (25a) / agriyó vā́caḥ (26b), as well as forms of víśva- (25c víśvāni, 26c viśvam(ejaya)). In 27a Soma is addressed by the voc. kave, while 25c contains the phrase víśvāni kā́vyā.
