In addition to the chaining with the previous vs. (on which see immediately above), this vs. participates in other verbal echoes, as noted in the published introduction. The end of the 2nd pāda vicarṣaṇe forms a ring with vícarṣanim at the end of the 2nd pāda of vs. 1, and the last pāda, prajā́vad réta ā́bhara, is identical to the last pāda of the first vs. of the immediately preceding hymn, IX.59.1 prajā́vad rátnam ā́bhara, with the substitution of rétaḥ for rátnam. In our case the semen (rétaḥ) would be both the actual semen that produces offspring and the liquid soma that mimics it.
