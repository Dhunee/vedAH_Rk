Both Geldner and Renou render pávamānasya as simply the epithet Pavamāna, but this loses the parallelism between the two gen. sg. pres. participles that open and close the hemistich: pávamānasya … abhyundatáḥ. I render these participles as “while” clauses, to avoid the awkward “we choose the companionship of you who are Xing.”

There are faint signs of unity in this tṛca: the word pavítram ‘filter’ is found in vss. 4 and 5, and both 4 and 6 have pres. mid. participles derived from √pū ‘purify’ (pávamāna- 4a, punāná- 6a), but since this is a Soma Pavamāna hymn, this is hardly remarkable.
