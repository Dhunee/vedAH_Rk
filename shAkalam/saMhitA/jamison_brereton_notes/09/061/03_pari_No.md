The Inhaltsakk. with pári … kṣárā are disharmonious in formation, with the sg.

noun áśvam (rendered in the published translation as the mass noun ‘horseflesh’, perhaps a bit too vividly) in pāda a followed by two possessive adj. gómat and híraṇyavat ‘possessing / consisting of cattle (and) gold’ in pāda b, followed by a pl. NP sahasríṇīr íṣaḥ ‘thousandfold refreshments’ in c. In a we might have expected áśvāvat ‘possessing / consisting of horses’, to match the adjectival forms in b, but the phonologically similar and adjacent aśvavíd ‘horse-finding’ may have blocked it (to avoid *áśvāvad aśvavíd [though some RVic poets would have loved that phrase]).

This tṛca shows some signs of unity. The 1st two vss. are a syntactic unit, with the objects of the verb in 1c partly postponed to 2ab. The third vs. has as its verb pári … kṣárā, which echoes pári srava in 1a.
