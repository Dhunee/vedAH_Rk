I am, reluctantly, taking dákṣa- as an adj. here (as in IX.62.4), with Geldner and Renou, though it is generally a masc. noun. Alternatively a noun interpr. is possible (cf. Ober I.457 “dein Saft ist Fähigkeit”): “your sap shines forth brilliant as skill” or “… shines as brilliant skill,” though I still prefer the adjectival interpr. See Renou’s disc.

Scarlatta (237) takes ví rājati as ‘rules’ (“dein Saft herrscht weithin als König …” A pun is certainly possible here, but the insistent light imagery (dyumā́n in b and the whole c pāda) suggests that the ‘shine’ sense is the dominant one.

In c Geldner takes víśvam as the modifier of jyótiḥ (“… ist alles licht”); so also Scarlatta (237).

This is certainly possible, and jyótir vaiśvānarám in 16c might support it. But “for everyone / all to see the sun” is a locution encountered elsewhere (I.15.1, 5, VIII.49.8, X.136.1), incl.

nearby IX.48.4. My interpr. is shared with Renou and Ober (I.457).

This tṛca is unified by the simple device of stationing a form of pávamāna- at the beginning of each vs. (16a, 17a, 18a). Note also the two forms of rása- ‘sap’ in 17a and 18a (the two pādas are scramblings of each other: 17a pávamānasya te rásaḥ, 18a pávamāna rásas táva, with different case forms of pávamāna- and enclitic versus full form of the gen. sg. 2nd ps. prn.). And 16c jyótir vaiśvānarám … matched by 18c jyótir víśvam …
