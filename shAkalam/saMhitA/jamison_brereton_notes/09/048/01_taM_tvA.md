Geldner and Renou take cā́rum as referring to Soma, as it, admittedly, often does. I interpr.

it rather as a 2nd obj. of īmahe (√yā / ī ‘implore, beg for’. (Geldner takes the verb to √yā ‘go’ [“nahen wir”], while Renou takes it to ‘implore’, but with a single obj.) Either interpr. is possible; I find myself more sympathetic to that of Geldner/Renou than I originally was, though I am far from disavowing the published translation

The possible allusion to the Somaraub in this vs. is quite muted, but I wonder if the depiction of Soma “bearing his manly powers among the seats of great heaven” (sadhástheṣu mahó diváḥ) could refer to Soma when he is being kept captive in heaven in the myth. A very slight piece of evidence for this is that Kṛśānu, the archer in the Somaraub story (see IV.27.3), is located sadhástha ā́“in the seat” in X.64.8, but I would put little or no weight on this.
