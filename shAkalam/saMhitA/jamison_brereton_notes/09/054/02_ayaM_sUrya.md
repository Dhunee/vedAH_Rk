Geldner takes dhāvati as transitive, with sárāṃsi and pravátaḥ as obj. (“dieser lässt Seen, sieben Ströme zum Himmel fliessen”), but the thematic pres. to √dhāv ‘run’ (as opposed to √dhāv ‘rinse’) is only a verb of motion with acc. of goal, not a causative. Geldner’s interpr. is not shared by others: besides Renou, cf. Lüders (153), Gotō (1st Kl. 183), Scarlatta (229), all of whose interpr. are very like mine.
