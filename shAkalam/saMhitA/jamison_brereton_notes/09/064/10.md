There are some unifying features in this tṛca. Although this is hardly striking in the IXth Maṇḍala, all three vs. contain a form of √pū, with those in vss. 11, 12 the identical phrase pavítra ā́“in the filter. The word índu- opens the first and last pādas of the tṛca (10a, 12c). The cmpd devā-vī́- ‘pursuing the gods’ in 11b is echoed by its splv. devavī́tama- in 12b. More subtly, the missing obj. of sṛját in 10c is most likely ‘wave’, found in the resumptive rel. cl. opening vs. 11, ūrmír yáḥ … For the VP ūrmím √sṛj see VI.17.12 asṛja ūrmím apā́m adduced by Oldenberg
