On pari √stubh see nearby IX.62.24. It is not entirely clear to me how the kṛ́p- (form, body) of Soma would ‘encircle with chant/rhythm’, since its physical form should not be producing noise. More common is the association of kṛ́p- with light (esp. the light of Agni), as Renou points out (cf. VI.2.6 kṛpā́… rocase, VII.3.9 sváyā kṛpā́tanvā̀rócamānaḥ), but in our passage rucā́and kṛpā́are parallel and independent. A passive sense ‘encircled with chant/rhythm’ (so Renou) would work better in context, but that seems precluded by the use of the act. stem stóbha-.

The contrast between the two types of soma drinks, pure and mixed with milk, are highlighted in this tṛca, at least in my view: 28c sómāḥ śukrā́gávāśiraḥ describes them straightforwardly, while 30ab ṛdhák … saṃjagmānáḥ “separately (and) uniting (with milk)” is more cryptic.
