Oldenberg’s interpr. of vṛ́ṣā in c as a neut. pl. adj. with dhármāṇi seems both unnecessary and unlikely. I know of no other neut. forms of vṛ́ṣan- (the few cited by Oldenberg are not convincing), which suggests to me that, despite its widely accepted classification as an adj., the stem is synchronically a masc. noun, which, however, can be used as an adjunct strengthener of another noun, hence “bull X” as the equivalent of “bullish X” - a usage similar to English ‘horse’ as an augmentative, meaning ‘strong, large, coarse’ (as in, for ex., horseradish). See https://www.etymonline.com/word/horseradish Moreover, since nom. sg.

vṛ́ṣā opens the two previous pādas of this vs., it seems unlikely that a morphologically different, and at the least very rare, phonologically identical form would open the third - esp. since, when a neut. adj. is required in the next vs. (2a), the deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya- is employed.

As noted in the published introduction, this opening tṛca is marked by the identification of Soma and his attributes with a bull (vṛ́ṣan-). This theme is especially dominant in vss. 1 and 2: all three pādas of vs. 1 open vṛ́ṣā, with the bahuvrīhi vṛ́ṣa-vrataḥ ending the first hemistich; vs. 2 is even more insistent, with two forms of the stem (or deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya-) in each of the three pādas. By contrast, vs. 3 only nods at the theme: vṛ́ṣā appears once in 3a, though the final word of the vs., vṛdhi, may be meant to echo the word phonologically.
