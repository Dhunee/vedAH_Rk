The isolated summary vs. The cow’s hide (gávye ádhi tvací) closely matches gór ádhi tvací in 11b, but the sheep’s fleece is found nowhere else in the hymn, unless the ví of 11a gestures towards it. See comm. ad loc.

The dog returns from the first tṛca in the first vs. of this one. The tṛca is also more rhetorically ambitious than those in the middle of this hymn, with an abundance of similes (13b, d, 14b, c, d, 15b). Vss. 14 and 15 end identically.
