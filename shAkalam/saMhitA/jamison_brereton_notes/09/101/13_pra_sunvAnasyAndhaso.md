Geldner takes ná in b as the neg. (flg. Sāyaṇa.) and asserts (n. 13), contra Oldenberg, that the presence of the mortal and the dog in this vs. (and the VS vs. Oldenberg cites) is an accident. But the position of ná in the pāda is that of the simile particle (though at least it would immed. precede the verb), and the wealth of similes in this tṛca supports a simile reading here as well. The point of the hemistich is that, like the human, the dog is attracted to the sound of the soma ritual, particularly the sound of the soma pressing, and invades it.

The 2nd hemistich begins like 1c: ápa śvā́nam … The simile in d, “as the Bhr̥gus did the Battler” (makháṃ ná bhṛ́gavaḥ), refers to what Geldner calls an otherwise unknown saga. The makhá- is found as a defeated enemy of Indra in X.171.2, a hymn attributed to one Iṭa Bhārgava, the patronymic of the victors in our vs.. Note that the denom. verb makhasyate occurs in our vs. 5c.

The dog returns from the first tṛca in the first vs. of this one. The tṛca is also more rhetorically ambitious than those in the middle of this hymn, with an abundance of similes (13b, d, 14b, c, d, 15b). Vss. 14 and 15 end identically.
