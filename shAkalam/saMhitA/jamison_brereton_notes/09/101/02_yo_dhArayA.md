Rather than making c a nominal main clause (with Geldner and Renou), I think it better to take the whole vs. as a rel. cl., dependent on tám, which opens the next vs. ### 03
On the impossible word duróṣa(s)- see comm. ad VIII.1.13. This is the only one of its three occurrences where it qualifies soma, though in Avestan dūraošais only used of haoma. Geldner refuses to tr. (though he discusses it extensively in n. 3a); Renou ‘difficile à mouvoir’ (see his n. for disc.).

The lengthened ī́of abhī́may represent abhí + ī, the enclitic acc., as I suggest for the same form in the preceding hymn, IX.100.1. In fact, just as in 100.1, it could represent a degeminated īm before the nasal of náraḥ.

Both Geldner and Renou take yajñám as the direct obj. of hinvanti rather than the goal, as I do (Geldner “Soma … als Opfer”). It is certainly true that yajñám √hi is found elsewhere (see Geldner’s n. 3c) and that the dat. is more often used for goal or purpose with √hi. Still, the sacrifice is so often the goal of motion, the goal of motion is so often in the acc., and soma is so often the obj. of √hi that I prefer to keep soma and the sacrifice as separate entities.

There is no particular unity visible in this tṛca, and vs. 1 in particular stands apart from the rest.

These two vss. are quoted in JB I.163 just after Indra’s use of our vs. 1 to kill the demoness, and the set of vss. is prescribed for the smiting of haters, rivals, demonic power, and evil. These are the only two Gāyatrī vss. in this Anuṣṭubh hymn.
