The first hemistich seems clearly (at least to me) to contrast the ritual soma streams on earth (a) with those in heaven (b), though curiously it does not seem to have caught Lüders’s attention. That pl. asaścátaḥ elsewhere (IX.57.1, 62.28) explicitly modifies dhā́rāḥ ‘streams’ makes that identification in b quite likely. See also

See comm. on IX.41.1-2 on the similarity of phraseology in these two pairs of vss. These vss. usher in the use of ritual speech against a variety of enemies.

Geldner considers these vss. “doppelsinnig,” with ref. both to the priest-poets and the soma juices. This seems quite reasomable, and his individual notes are worth the attention.
