With Sāyaṇa. and Renou but contra Geldner, I consider the father and mother of pāda a to be Heaven and Earth, matching that same pair in d. The reference is to the earthly and heavenly soma of 4a and b, which “sound in unison,” though also including the priest-poets, as disc. in the published introduction. They marshall their joint power, embodied in the māyā́associated with Varuṇa, against those “without commandments” (avratā́n); vratá- are of course esp. associated with Varuṇa, and by virtue of their presence in both heaven and earth can banish enemies from both places.

Note the return of √dham ‘blow’ from 1a. In its earlier occurrence this root simply expressed the action of the drop (drapsásya dhámataḥ), but here the verb has been weaponized, as it were, against enemies.

See comm. on IX.41.1-2 on the similarity of phraseology in these two pairs of vss. These vss. usher in the use of ritual speech against a variety of enemies.

These two vss., almost in the center of the hymn, have a similar structure.

Their first pādas are nearly identical: ABL ABL ádhy ā́yé samásvaran “Those who sounded in unison from X X.” The second pādas simply further describe the unspecified subject of the first pādas, while their second hemistichs present what happens to evil beings as a result of the sounding in unison of the first. See also Oldenberg on the symmetry of the vss. and how this affects their interpr.
