See remarks ad vs. 3.

The part. viprayántaḥ presumably belongs to the lexeme ví-prá √i, but note that it could also be interpr. as belonging to a denom. *vipra-yá- ‘behave like [/seek] an inspired poet’, which would connect this vs. further with the poetic pervasion of vs. 3. The suggested denom. stem is not attested but could of course be easily formed, and I’m tolerably sure this pun was meant. Note vipāscítaḥ and vipā́, both in the matching vs. 3. I would now slightly alter the tr. to “going forth widely [/behaving like inspired poets].”

More chaining: vss. 4 and 6 end with rájaḥ; the exact phrase in 5c is uttamáṃ rájaḥ, whose uttamám is then picked up in 6a and augmented with uttamā́yyam in 6c.

Meanwhile, 3rd pl. pf. (vy) ā̀naśuḥ of 3c, 5b morphs into 3rd pl. root aor. āśata in 6b. As Oldenberg points out, √(n)aś is also represented by the desid. íyakṣantaḥ in 4c.

My “that is to be higher still” is meant to capture the pseudo-gerundive form of the nonce uttamā́yi ya-.
