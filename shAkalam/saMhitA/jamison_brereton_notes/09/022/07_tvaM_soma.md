Both Geldner and Renou take acikradaḥ as transitive/causative (e.g., “tu l’as fait crier”), but although (á)cikrada- looks like a typical redupl. aor. to an -áya-transitive, it is not so used.

On the problem of this redupl. aor., see my 1983 -áya- book (pp. 110-11)(though I would now disavow a second √krand ‘race’, beside ‘roar’).

As noted in the published introduction, vs. 7 stands somewhat apart from the rest of the hymn, but there is chaining here as well: 6a tántuṃ tanvānám … is echoed by 7c tatáṃ tántum …
