With Geldner/Renou I take ná as neg. with pf. śaśramuḥ. In contrast, Kümmel (524, 551) takes it as the simile particle: “... sind wie [Rennpferde], die gelaufen sind, ermüdet ...” He cites (551 n. 1141) Delbrück (Altind. Syn. 376) for this interpr., but Delbrück in fact takes the ná as neg.: “… sind nicht müde geworden, obgleich sie gelaufen sind.” I assume that Kümmel so interpr. because of the position of ná after the participle, but in a Gāyatrī pāda the position before the verb is also the position after the NP -- there’s not a lot of space. I think it unlikely that the poets would ever say that the ever-running soma could get tired. Moreover, √śram almost always appears with neg.

More chaining: vss. 4 and 6 end with rájaḥ; the exact phrase in 5c is uttamáṃ rájaḥ, whose uttamám is then picked up in 6a and augmented with uttamā́yyam in 6c.

Meanwhile, 3rd pl. pf. (vy) ā̀naśuḥ of 3c, 5b morphs into 3rd pl. root aor. āśata in 6b. As Oldenberg points out, √(n)aś is also represented by the desid. íyakṣantaḥ in 4c.

My “that is to be higher still” is meant to capture the pseudo-gerundive form of the nonce uttamā́yi ya-.
