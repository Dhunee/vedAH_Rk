Initial tribhíḥ matches initial ubhā́bhyām in 25a. Since ubhā́bhyām was further specified by a bipartite NP pavítreṇa savéna ca (25b), I would like to see three instr. in this vs., each correlated with one of the three gods mentioned. And this is how I have rendered it, with várṣiṣṭhaiḥ connected to Savitar (and Soma), dhā́mabhiḥ with Soma, and dákṣaiḥ with Agni. By contrast, Geldner and Renou construe várṣiṣṭhaiḥ with dhā́mabhiḥ, which they consider to be of three types (that is, “with the three highest dhā́mans …”; Renou “avec les trois positions les plus éminentes”) - although in their notes both come close to espousing a position close to mine. Possibly in their favor is the fact that soma is unaccented in b, and if várṣiṣṭhaiḥ is followed by a sub-clausal break, the voc. might (or might not) have been accented. In the published translation I read várṣiṣṭhaiḥ both with Savitar’s savaíḥ, which has to be supplied, and with Soma’s dhā́mabhiḥ, and tr. the latter slightly differently: “through Soma’s domains.”

As noted in the published introduction, these vss. are a self-contained purificatory spell, with all vss. ending with an act. impv. belonging to the pres. punā́ti: all 2nd sg. punīhi (naḥ) except 22c punātu (naḥ). The means of purification is, in the first instance, the filter (pavítra-), which of course literally means ‘instrument (-tra-) of purification’. 

The pavítra is mentioned in vss. 22-25, with other, non-physical means of purification added (e.g., the sacred formulation vss. 23-24), with these means appropriate to the gods who wield them (Savitar’s ‘impulsion’ [savá-] vs. 25). The first agent of purification is Soma Pavamāna himself (22), then Agni (23-24), then Savitar (25). The three - Soma, Agni, and Savitar - then appear together in 26, and in the final vs. (27) it opens out to all the divinities. The rhetoric is pretty flat, but the structure is a pleasing example of repetitive variation.
