In addition to the introduction of Savitar, we also get a slight rearrangement in word order. The conjoined phrase pavítreṇa savéna ca would not fit in the slot right before the impv. in c, a position it occupies in 23c, 24b, 24c, 26c, so the final enclitic naḥ is converted to a full prn. mā́m and placed in initial position. This prn. also has to be read as distracted máām to achieve 8 syllables. I wonder why the poet didn’t just use asmā́n, which would fit the meter and better match naḥ. One of the only instances in which I think I could compose the vs. better than the poet - though “me” (both tonic mā́m and enclitic mā) serves as insistent obj. in vs. 27.

As noted in the published introduction, these vss. are a self-contained purificatory spell, with all vss. ending with an act. impv. belonging to the pres. punā́ti: all 2nd sg. punīhi (naḥ) except 22c punātu (naḥ). The means of purification is, in the first instance, the filter (pavítra-), which of course literally means ‘instrument (-tra-) of purification’. 

The pavítra is mentioned in vss. 22-25, with other, non-physical means of purification added (e.g., the sacred formulation vss. 23-24), with these means appropriate to the gods who wield them (Savitar’s ‘impulsion’ [savá-] vs. 25). The first agent of purification is Soma Pavamāna himself (22), then Agni (23-24), then Savitar (25). The three - Soma, Agni, and Savitar - then appear together in 26, and in the final vs. (27) it opens out to all the divinities. The rhetoric is pretty flat, but the structure is a pleasing example of repetitive variation.
