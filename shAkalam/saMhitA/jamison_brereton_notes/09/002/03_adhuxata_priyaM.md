etám tyám … marmṛjyánte apasyúvaḥ “This very one [=soma] do the industrious (fingers) groom,” with the same adj. qualifying the subject as here. Though the transitivity of the verb in 38.3 is quite clear, our passage is more ambiguous -- and has been discussed at some length by Geldner (n. 7), Bloomfield (RReps ad loc.), and Renou If we wish the verb to be tr., we can supply ‘you’, as Bloomfield suggests (also Renou as an alternative). Or we can take gíraḥ as acc., rather than nom., and tr. “the industrious ones constantly groom the songs …” However, I prefer to take the verb as passive (as two of the three forms of the pres. part. marmṛjyámāna- are) and see the vs. as an expression of ritual reciprocity: the songs are groomed by the power of Soma -- that is, the hymns recited at the Soma Sacrifice are refined and perfected by the inspiration given to the poets by Soma -- while those perfected hymns in turn adorn and beautify the soma offering.

These two vss. introduce the trope of “clothing,” a metaphor for mixing the soma juice with various substances: after the pressing proper the soma is mixed first with water (vs. 3) and then with milk (vs. 4), the latter accounting for the ubiquitous “cows” of the IXth Maṇḍala. Thus, though an expression “clothe himself with cows” initially strikes the inexperienced reader as ludicrous, it makes perfect sense in the tightly constructed verbal realm of the Soma hymns: clothing = mixing and cows = waters.
