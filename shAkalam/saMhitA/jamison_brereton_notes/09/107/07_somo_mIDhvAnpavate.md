The two splvs ending the a and c pādas show a nice phonological relationship: (gātu-)vít-tama- and (deva-)vī́-tama, with interchange between long vowel + single cons. and short vowel + geminate in otherwise identical phonetic seequences, an effect reminiscent of MIA quantitative trade-offs.

The c pādas of these two vss. are identically constructed: tváṃ vípro [6] / kavír [7] abhavo SPLV. Vs. 7 repeats the word vípra- along with ṛṣí- in 7b, so the pragātha seems to have a preoccupation with the varieties of poet.
