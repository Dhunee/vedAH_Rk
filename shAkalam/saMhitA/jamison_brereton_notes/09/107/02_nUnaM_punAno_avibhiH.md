The 2nd hemistich of this vs. is intricately interwoven with constituents overlapping; see Oldenberg’s sensible treatment at loc. The initial loc. expression consists of suté cit … apsú, with tvā interspersed in modified 2nd position. This tvā is not to construed with the nearby verb madāma (pace Grassmann), because máda- without preverb is almost never construed with an acc.; here that verb goes with the instr. ándhasā. The tvā finally finds its governing verb form in the participle śrīṇántaḥ beginning pāda d; it is so distant from it, with parts of two different constituents in between, because it took Wackernagel’s position in the clause. The adj. úttaram at the very end of the vs. modifies it: the soma is “higher” or “better” at this point presumably because the mixing with milk, the last step depicted, improves it.

The first metrical unit in the hymn has a third vs. appended to the pragātha with a 2-pāda configuration of 12 8, identified by the Anukr. as Dvipadā Virāj Bhurij. Arnold (248, E72) analyses vss. 2-3 as simply an extended Satobṛhatī (12 8 / 12 8 / 12 8). See Oldenberg (Proleg. 104-5) on the types of extensions of pragāthas, incl. this one. Since vs. 3 simply hangs off vs. 2 and need not be syntactically independent, the “extension” suggestion is quite plausible.

The vss. are knitted together by lexical repetition and variation. A sample of the lexical evidence: apsú is found in 1c, 2c; uttamám (1b) is picked up by úttaram (2d); the three instr. pl. ádribhiḥ (1d), ávibhiḥ (2a), góbhiḥ (2d) echo each other - the first two phonologically, the 2nd and 3rd semantically.
