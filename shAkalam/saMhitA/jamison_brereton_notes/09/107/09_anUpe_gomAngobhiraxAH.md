Both instances of akṣāḥ should probably be read with distracted 2nd syllable, to provide the right no. of syllables in b and the right cadence in both pādas.

In addition, pāda a is metrically deficient, even with this distracted reading. We expect a 12-syl. pāda in the Satobṛhatī that provides the 2nd vss. of the pragāthas in this hymn; the Anukr. simply identifies the vs. instead as a Bṛhatī, which should have an 8-syl. pāda in this position. Even without distracted akṣāḥ, it would have 9 syllables, and with the distraction 10. Best to consider it a deficient Satobṛhatī, which is the vs.-form expected, than an over-abundant Bṛhatī. As for ways to make up the deficiency, see Oldenberg A distracted reading of anūpé would provide at least one more syllable as well as a standard 4-syl. opening; however, neither etym. (*anu-Hp-á-; see EWA s.v.) nor the other occurrence of the stem (X.27.23) favors this distraction.

Oldenberg rather exasperatedly suggests that the metrical disturbances in this vs. (see also the Triṣṭubh cadence of c in a 12-syl. pāda) may result from “mangelhaftes Formgefühl des Vfs.”

The 2nd hemistich of vs. 8 and the first of vs. 9 have a refrain-like structure reminiscent of the echo pādas in Atyaṣṭi, which is unusual for this meter: 8cd … harítā yāti dhā́rayā, mandráyā yāti dhā́rayā#; 9ab … góbhir akṣāḥ, … dugdhā́bhir akṣāḥ#.
