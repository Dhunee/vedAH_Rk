Since áśvayā is fem., the tr. should be emended to “with a golden mare.” See Geldner’s disc. (n. 8cd) and dismissal of Roth’s proposed emendation (also rejected by Oldenberg), to bring out the comparison of the stream of soma to the urine stream of a horse, which, as Geldner points out, is still possible without emendation.

The 2nd hemistich of vs. 8 and the first of vs. 9 have a refrain-like structure reminiscent of the echo pādas in Atyaṣṭi, which is unusual for this meter: 8cd … harítā yāti dhā́rayā, mandráyā yāti dhā́rayā#; 9ab … góbhir akṣāḥ, … dugdhā́bhir akṣāḥ#.
