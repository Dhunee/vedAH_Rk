Since áśvayā is fem., the tr. should be emended to “with a golden mare.” See Geldner’s disc. (n. 8cd) and dismissal of Roth’s proposed emendation (also rejected by Oldenberg), to bring out the comparison of the stream of soma to the urine stream of a horse, which, as Geldner points out, is still possible without emendation.
