Both vss. describing Soma taking his seat (4c, 5b). There is also concatenation between pragāthas: the final word of 5, vicakṣaṇáḥ, matches that of vs. 3, the final word of its metrical grouping. And the first word of vs. 4, punānáḥ, is reprised as the beginning of 6 (and echoes the same participle in the 2nd position in 2a).
