The vs. begins with a most unusual sandhi: párītó ṣiñcatā. Geldner (n. 1a; cf. ZDMG 65: 307) suggests that it is Prakritizing. Oldenberg and Renou, less dramatically, consider it to be based on IX.63.10 párīto vāyáve sutám, where the sandhi of itás is correct. (Geldner also cites this vs.) Renou points out that that vs. ends with siñcata and suggests that the unusual sandhi here “résulte de l’assemblage des extrémités du v.

63,10.” Although the invocation of 63.10 seems apposite, it doesn’t entirely explain the sandhi we find here. The -o of párītó can be explained as the adoption of this word sequence from its position before vd. C in 63.10, but the retroflexion in ṣiñcatā does not follow. In fact, in 63.10, though siñcata occurs after -u (vā́reṣu siñcata), there is no ruki-induced retroflexion over morpheme boundary (nor do we expect it).

Instead I think we must explain the retroflexion as an effect of the preverb pári. By far the greatest number of the retroflexed initials of this root occur immediately after pári, esp. the passive stem (pari) ṣicyá- (15 exx.), but also the ppl. páriṣikta- (8x); see also, in the next hymn (IX.108.7), our exact 2nd pl. act. impv. pári ṣiñcata. There is also retroflexion after the preverb ní (5+), and after the particles tū́(2x) and hí (1x). All of these are contact-induced, unlike our example, where the preverb is separated from the verb. Under these circumstances, there is ordinarily no retroflexion (see pári … siñcata X.32.5, pári … siktáḥ IX.97.15). However, here I think either the numerous exx. of pári √ṣic in IX (15+) imposed distant retroflexion here where it was phonologically unmotivated, or an unretroflexed initial was changed redactionally under the influence of pári ṣiñcata in the next hymn.

The first metrical unit in the hymn has a third vs. appended to the pragātha with a 2-pāda configuration of 12 8, identified by the Anukr. as Dvipadā Virāj Bhurij. Arnold (248, E72) analyses vss. 2-3 as simply an extended Satobṛhatī (12 8 / 12 8 / 12 8). See Oldenberg (Proleg. 104-5) on the types of extensions of pragāthas, incl. this one. Since vs. 3 simply hangs off vs. 2 and need not be syntactically independent, the “extension” suggestion is quite plausible.

The vss. are knitted together by lexical repetition and variation. A sample of the lexical evidence: apsú is found in 1c, 2c; uttamám (1b) is picked up by úttaram (2d); the three instr. pl. ádribhiḥ (1d), ávibhiḥ (2a), góbhiḥ (2d) echo each other - the first two phonologically, the 2nd and 3rd semantically.
