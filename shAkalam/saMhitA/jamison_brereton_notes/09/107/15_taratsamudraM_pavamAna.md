On Soma identified as “truth” (ṛtám), see IX.97.23, IX.108.8, and Lüders 581-82. Although ṛtáṃ bṛhát could be an acc. goal here, the parallels, esp. the identical pāda in the next hymn, IX.108.8, support a nom. identification. In IX.97.23-24 Soma is also identified as a king (rā́jā 24b) as here and as ‘possessing dhárman’ (dharmā́23c), reminiscent of dhármaṇā here.

The Pp. analyses árṣan opening c as injunc. árṣat, while the published translation assumes a nom. sg. pres. part. árṣan. Either is of course possible, but the parallelism with vs. initial tárat may support the finite verb interpr., as Oldenberg points out. So an alt. tr. would be: “he rushes …” See Hoffmann (117) on this vs.; he is surely right that the two injunctives should receive the same interpr., rather than Renou’s indic. pres. tárat, modal árṣat, and Hoffmann’s “general” pres. interpr. seems apt here for both.

Like vss. 1-3, this pragātha has a two-pāda addition (vs. 16), also 12 8. Both 14 and 15 contain the part. pávamāna-; all three vss. contain forms of samudrá-, samudríya-, while 16 repeats the phrase rā́jā deváḥ from 15b. In 16 haryatáḥ recalls the same word in 13a, and vicakṣaṇáḥ those in 3b, 5d. The voc. of this stem is found in vs. 24.
