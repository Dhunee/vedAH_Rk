No particular internal cohesion, but a number of ties with other parts of the hymn. The Āyus are found in 17d as the groomers of Soma, while in 14a they were identified with him. The verb arṣati (17c) returns from 15c (see also 4b, 5c), and avyata (18d) from 13a. The phrase apó vásānaḥ (18c) is also found in 4a, and see disc. of the rest of 18c below.
