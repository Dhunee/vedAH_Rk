Both Geldner and Renou construe samudré with mṛjyámānaḥ (e.g., “Im Meer sauber gemacht”), but surely our passage can't be separated from IX.12.6 prá vā́cam índur iṣyati, samudrásyā́dhi viṣṭápi “The drop sends forth his speech upon the surface of the sea,” a passage adduced by Geldner (n. 21b) without comment.
