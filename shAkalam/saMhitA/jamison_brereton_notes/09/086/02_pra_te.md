It seems a little odd to say that chariot horses go “each separately,” since one would think that the horses would be attached to the same chariot and efficient movement would require them to pull together. But almost the same phrase occurs in X.91.7 … rathyò yáthā pṛ́thak, though there referring to charioteers, and so the words must belong together. Perhaps it refers to separate chariots, each with its own set of horses—or that each horse in a chariot team has its own place in harness and each individually contributes to the speed of the whole?

The first two vss. of this tṛca begin identically (prá te), and all three vss.

concern the swift journey of the soma drinks, which is compared to that of swift animals. Vss. 1 and 3 share the same verb (√ṛṣ: 1b arṣanti, 3a arṣa; ásṛkṣata in 2b is semantically similar) and the same goal, the kóśa- or ‘cask’, while vss. 1 and 2 both contain āś́vaḥ ‘swift’. Of course none of these features is unusual in the soma corpus, so they are not strong evidence for tṛca unity.
