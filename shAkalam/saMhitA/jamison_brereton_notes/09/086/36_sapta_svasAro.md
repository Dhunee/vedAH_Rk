Who the seven sisters (bzw. mothers) are is a matter of dispute: Sāyaṇa.: the streams or rivers, Geldner: thoughts, Renou (flg. Lüders 246): celestial streams/rivers. No one seems to cite the seven milk-cows (saptá dhenávaḥ) in vs. 25 of this same hymn, or their multiplied number (thrice seven) in 21. But in this hymn “cows” seems the mostly likely immediate referent, esp. given the image of maternal care, whatever those cows may otherwise represent (beyond the milk-mixture).

On the expression in the last pāda, see similar phrases in vss. 5 and 28.

Nothing much in the way of internal unity or external connection, beyond the obvious soma themes.
