Pāda a is metrically disturbed, despite apparently having 12 syl. With Arnold and Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition, best to read *hyānáḥ for hiyānáḥ (as sometimes elsewhere), to avoid a too early or too late caesura and a bad Jagatī cadence. The pāda is then a fine Triṣṭubh.

Although, as noted above, vss. 1 and 3 share the same goal, the kóśa-, the physical referent has changed between 1 and 3. In the former, the cask is presumably the soma vessel on the ritual ground, but in 3b it is characterized as kóśaṃ divó ádrimātaram “the cask of heaven, whose mother is the stone”—in other words the vault of the sky (or the soma container in the sky). So the subject is the heavenly soma, not merely the ritual substance, even though the ritual details are re-asserted in cd. For the heavenly cask, see V.53. 6, 59.8, IX.88.6. Oldenberg reports without enthusiasm a potential emendation to nom. ádrimātā, modifying soma, with ádri- the pressing stone. This would yield another Triṣṭubh pāda. However, since heaven (or at least the container of the heavenly soma) may be made of stone, there seems no reason to emend.

In the published translation for ease of English parsing I moved the tr. of svarvíd from b to cd, but this mixes the levels: the sun-finding Soma is the one that reaches heaven, while the soma of cd is the substance purified in the sheep’s filter. Better (if somewhat awkward): “… rush to the prize, as the sun-finder (rush) to the cask of heaven …”

The first two vss. of this tṛca begin identically (prá te), and all three vss.

concern the swift journey of the soma drinks, which is compared to that of swift animals. Vss. 1 and 3 share the same verb (√ṛṣ: 1b arṣanti, 3a arṣa; ásṛkṣata in 2b is semantically similar) and the same goal, the kóśa- or ‘cask’, while vss. 1 and 2 both contain āś́vaḥ ‘swift’. Of course none of these features is unusual in the soma corpus, so they are not strong evidence for tṛca unity.
