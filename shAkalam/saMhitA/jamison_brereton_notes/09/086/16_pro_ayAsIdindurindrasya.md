Pāda b strikes me as the quotation of a well-known general truth or proverb, providing the basis for the particular action of pāda a: Soma cannot let Indra down, because (of the old saw) “a comrade …” It’s also worth noting that the other occurrence of saṃgír- (X.89.9) is also the obj. of prá √mī. Renou also adduces IV.25.7 ná … sakhyám índraḥ … sáṃ gṛṇīte “Indra does not agree to companionship (with …).”

The first two vss. of this tṛca begin with prá with a verb of motion, but otherwise there is little that unifies the tṛca. Nor is there much that connects with the rest of the hymn, save for 16a … ayāsīt … índrasya niṣkṛtám / 7b=32d … úpa yāti niṣkṛtám and the repetition of saṃyát- in 18a (cf. 15d and disc. there).
