In a agre-gáḥ echoes ágre áhnām in 42a; in our vs. áhnām appears in the following pāda, dependent on something else (vimā́naḥ), though Renou supplies it with agregáḥ as well.

bhúvaneṣv árpitaḥ also in 39b.

In d I construe rāyé with okyàḥ, although I cannot find any parallel usage. But on its own, okyàḥ is hard to fit semantically into the vs.; cf. Geldner’s “gern bleibend” and Renou’s “(ce dieu) domestique,” which seem like afterthoughts..

This tṛca seems more artful than most of the other, with metaphor layered upon metaphor (vss. 43, 45), varied by similes (vs. 44).
