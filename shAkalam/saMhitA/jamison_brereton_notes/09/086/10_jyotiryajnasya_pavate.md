Geldner notes the parallels between our vs. and IX.75.2: IX.75.2a. … pavate mádhu priyám, …  2cd dádhāti putráḥ pitrór apīcyàm, nā́ma … IX.86.10a … pavate mádhu priyám, …  .10c dádhāti rátnaṃ svadháyor apīcyàm But he doesn’t seem to take the parallelism too seriously. In particular, though both 75.2c and 86.10c have a dual gen./loc. to be construed with a VP in which the subject deposits / establishes a secret X [name in 75.2, treasure in 86.10], Geldner takes the dual as loc. in 75.2 (where there’s a parallel loc. sg. rocané), but gen. here (“Er bringt das verborgene Kleinod der beiden Eigenmächte”)(sim. Renou), with a somewhat forced interpr. of dádhāti as ‘bringt’. Since the dual seems to have the same referent in both passages, Heaven and Earth (so both Geldner and Renou), and the passages are otherwise so similar, it seems to me very likely that they are structured in the same way. I therefore take svadháyoḥ as loc. It’s worth noting that this is the only du. form of the stem svadhā́-

Following a pattern we’ve met earlier, the first vs. of the new tṛca echoes the previous one. In particular, the beginning of 10a jyótir yajñásya pavate is almost identical to 7a yajñásya ketúr pavate, with ketú- = jyótis- semantically and the order of the first two elements flipped. As for intra-tṛca connections, 10b #pitā́ devā́nām is picked up by 11b #pátir diváḥ. There is also a fair amount of repetition of vocabulary and even phraseology from earlier in the hymn (e.g., 6cd … mṛjyáte háriḥ … kaláśeṣu sīdati and 11cd háriḥ … sádaneṣu sīdati, marmṛjānáḥ), but most of this involves material so ubiquitous in soma discourse that it doesn’t mean much.
