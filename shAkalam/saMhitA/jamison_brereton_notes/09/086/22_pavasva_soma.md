Although the Pp. analyzes ā́rohayaḥ as containing an augment (ā́/ arohayaḥ), it could equally well have an injunc.: ā́/ rohayaḥ. The latter would fit better with the injunc. ví rocayat in 21a, just disc.; the former with the other augmented forms of this tṛca.

The tṛca seems to be characterized by augmented imperfects, though three of the five could be injunctives instead: ā́rohayaḥ [maybe] 22d, abhavaḥ 23c, avṛṇoḥ [maybe] 23d, amadan 24b, ā́bharat [maybe] 24c. It is also characterized by mythic allusions, esp. the Vala myth and the opening of the cowpen for the Aṅgirases (23d) and the stealing of soma from heaven (24c), as well as the cosmogonic act of raising the sun into heaven (22d). Both this latter deed and the opening of the Vala cave are deeds usually attributed to Indra.

As for phraseology, in 22c and 23b the soma is “in the belly of Indra” (índrasya jaṭháre(ṣu) - sg. in 22c, pl. in 23b); pavítra ā́is found in both 22b and 23a.

With regard to external connections, 22d nṛ́bhir yatáḥ is also found in 20b, and 23b índrasya jaṭháreṣv āviśán echoes 19d índrasya hā́rdy āviśán, with a different body part.

It may also be that 22 continues the theme of 21: in 21a Soma made the dawns shine forth (ví rocayat), while in 22d he made the sun mount in heaven (sū́ryam ā́rohayo diví). The two verbs are not only identical in formation (both -áyatransitives) but phonologically similar.
