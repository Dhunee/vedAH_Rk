Although the standard interpr. of yáthā vidé here makes Soma subj. of the verb (e.g., Geldner “wie er es versteht”), pāda-final yáthā vidé is a common tag (I.127.4, 132.2, etc.) with a passive reading of the verb: “as is known, in the way that is known.” The “directives of truth” (ṛtásya praśíṣaḥ) are convincingly identified as the hymns by Lüders (469-70), as the adj. návīyas-, a standard descriptor of hymns in the fem., suggests.

I assume that the “threefold thread” (tántum … trivṛtám) refers to the three soma pressings.

After the tight structure of the preceding tṛca, we have returned to the lax stringing together of soma tropes. There is a lot of noise-making in 31 (b cakradat, c vāvaśānā́anūṣata), which is slightly echoed in 33 (b kánikradat).

Otherwise I see nothing particularly unifying.

As for external connections, GEN niṣkṛtám √yā in 32d is found also in 7b and 16a, and of course much of the soma lexicon is repeated elsewhere.
