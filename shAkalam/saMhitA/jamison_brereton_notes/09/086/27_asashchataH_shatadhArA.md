On the likely pun on abhiśríyaḥ, see Geldner (n. 27ab), also Scarlatta 547-48.

It is not entirely clear what “the third back” (tṛtī́ye pṛṣṭhé) refers to, but most likely the highest (third) realm of heaven. Cf., for the back of heaven in general, divás pṛṣṭhé in IX.66.5.

Cows (that is, the milk-mixture) are esp. prominent in this tṛca: there are seven in 25b (recalling the “thrice seven” that produced the milk-mixture in 21c), here called dhenávaḥ, with gā́ḥ in 26c and góbhiḥ in 27c. Other miscellaneous animals: the sheep’s fleece (ávye … vā́re 25a), buffaloes (mahiṣā́ḥ 26d), a steed (átyaḥ 26d), as well as the tawny one (hárim 25b, 27b), if that is specifically a tawny horse or, as in 31b (vṛ́ṣā … háriḥ), a tawny bull.

25b and 27b both open háriṃ navante, each followed by a diff. preverb to be construed with the verb (abhí, áva). In 27a asaścátaḥ recalls 18c ásaścuṣī.
