The aggressively hostile command in pāda c comes as something of a surprise in this otherwise ritually and cosmically focused hymn.

The last pāda is the Gṛtsamada refrain from Maṇḍala II. This tṛca is attributed by the Anukramaṇī to Gṛtsamada, but perhaps only on the basis of the refrain.

The hymn ends with a tṛca no more unified than most of those that preceded it, repeating the same tropes oscillating between ritual and cosmic images.
