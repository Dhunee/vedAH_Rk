Geldner interpr. pavate as a passive, with manīṣíbhiḥ as agent (“Von den Verständigen wird der allerste Seher geläutert”), but pávate is so insistently reflexive in the Soma maṇḍala that I strongly resist a passive here. Renou’s tr. is like mine, though he doesn’t comment.

Trita is the ur-Soma presser. See disc. ad IX.37.4. Here, as Geldner (n. 20c) suggests, Soma re-creates him for the current pressing, to ensure that Indra and Vāyu will get their soma.

No obvious signs of unity. The instr. manīṣíbhiḥ is found at the end of 19 and immediately afterwards at the beginning of 20. The dawn(s) and the rivers are found in both 19 and 21, but not in mutually reinforcing ways. As for external connections, the “partnership” (sakhyá-) of Indra and Vāyu in 20 is reminiscent of the companions/partners (implicitly Soma and Indra) in 16b. There are various lexical echoes (e.g., vicakṣaṇáḥ 19a = 11b), but the limited vocab. of the Soma hymns makes this unremarkable.
