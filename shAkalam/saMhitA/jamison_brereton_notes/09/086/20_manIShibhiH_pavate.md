Geldner interpr. pavate as a passive, with manīṣíbhiḥ as agent (“Von den Verständigen wird der allerste Seher geläutert”), but pávate is so insistently reflexive in the Soma maṇḍala that I strongly resist a passive here. Renou’s tr. is like mine, though he doesn’t comment.

Trita is the ur-Soma presser. See disc. ad IX.37.4. Here, as Geldner (n. 20c) suggests, Soma re-creates him for the current pressing, to ensure that Indra and Vāyu will get their soma.
