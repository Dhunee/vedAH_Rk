I do not know why the seats are identified as those of Mitra. I doubt that Lüders is correct that it is only because Mitra’s seat is in highest heaven (210), much less that Mitra is at this stage in Vedic being identified with the sun (605).

Following a pattern we’ve met earlier, the first vs. of the new tṛca echoes the previous one. In particular, the beginning of 10a jyótir yajñásya pavate is almost identical to 7a yajñásya ketúr pavate, with ketú- = jyótis- semantically and the order of the first two elements flipped. As for intra-tṛca connections, 10b #pitā́ devā́nām is picked up by 11b #pátir diváḥ. There is also a fair amount of repetition of vocabulary and even phraseology from earlier in the hymn (e.g., 6cd … mṛjyáte háriḥ … kaláśeṣu sīdati and 11cd háriḥ … sádaneṣu sīdati, marmṛjānáḥ), but most of this involves material so ubiquitous in soma discourse that it doesn’t mean much.
