There is disagreement about what it means for Soma to “enter all forms” (víśvā rūpā́ṇy āviśán): Geldner thinks that it refers to the various stages of soma preparation, while Renou that it refers to the divine forms, that is the gods, whom Soma enters when he is drunk. I slightly favor Geldner’s explanation, since Soma only reaches the gods in the last pāda.
