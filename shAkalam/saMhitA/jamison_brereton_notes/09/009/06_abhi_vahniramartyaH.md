The problem of the fem. referent continues here. In ab Soma, as the draught-horse (váhniḥ) “sees the seven” (saptá paśyati); we have just had “seven thoughts” (4a), and “seven” is the canonical number of rivers, which we also encountered in vs. 4 -- so either referent (or a conflation of both) is possible here. A fem. acc. pl. devī́ḥ ‘goddesses’ is the obj. of the verb ‘satisfied’ (atarpayat) in the next pāda c. Unfortunately this does not clarify the reference: the pl. of devī́- is frequently used of waters and at least once elsewhere (VII.50.4) of rivers, but at least in the singular it is quite commonly used of dhī́- and similar words.

On the hapax vā́vahi- see AiG II.2.292-93.

On the always ghastly krívi- see comm. ad I.30.1 and V.44.4. Esp. in the latter passage I argue that the word often seems to be used of an equine and that it might be a deformation or hyper-Sanskritization of kaví-. Both factors are present here: the first two pādas of this vs. depict Soma as a draught horse drawing (váhniḥ … vā́vahiḥ), but we also had occasion to note ad vs. 1 above that Soma was twice identified as a kaví- there. In the published translation I default to a PN, but I do in fact think that the word has richer semantics, derived from both just mentioned uses, here. I do not see any way to convey that in a single tr. of the word, however.

As noted in the published introduction, I consider this an omphalos hymn, with vss. 4 and 6 with their repetition of “7” defining vs. 5 as the omphalos. The omphalos effect is muted however, since the “message” of vs. 5 is hardly a deep mystery. For further on this sequence of vss., see published introduction.
