As Renou points out, the exact nuance of śruṣṭī́is hard to pinpoint, but Geldner’s recessive adverb “willig” does not seem sufficient. Renou also adduces II.3.9 śruṣṭī́… jāyate, similar to our śruṣṭī́jātā́saḥ. I interpr. both passages to mean that the right ritual birth happens because of a/the god’s attention to the process (Tvaṣṭar in II.3.9, Indra here).

All three vss. in this tṛca contain final 4-syllable sequences that could be syntactically distanced from what precedes, hence a likely 8 8 / 8 4 Uṣṇih type (so also Oldenberg). In vs. 1 this piece is svarvídaḥ, the signature word that recurs in the same metrical position in 4 (as svarvídam) and 9.

Vss. 2 and 3 are also lexically linked: sānasí- (2a, 3b), jaítrasya (2c) / -jít (3d).
