Both Geldner and Renou take jaítrasya as a noun ‘victory’, but with Grassmann I supply Indra as the referent for this vṛddhi adj. This would provide a thematic reciprocity between vss. 1 and 2: in 1 the soma drops are born because of Indra’s attentive hearing (in my interpr.), while here Soma repays Indra’s attention with his own.

All three vss. in this tṛca contain final 4-syllable sequences that could be syntactically distanced from what precedes, hence a likely 8 8 / 8 4 Uṣṇih type (so also Oldenberg). In vs. 1 this piece is svarvídaḥ, the signature word that recurs in the same metrical position in 4 (as svarvídam) and 9.

Vss. 2 and 3 are also lexically linked: sānasí- (2a, 3b), jaítrasya (2c) / -jít (3d).
