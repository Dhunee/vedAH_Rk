The nom., acc., voc., and gen. pl. of marút- do not fit any standard RVic cadence. It is not surprising then that though instr. marúdbhiḥ and dat./abl.

marúdbhyaḥ are regularly found in cadences, the other forms are almost entirely absent. Pāda b has a nom. pl. in the cadence (made worse by the fact that the word is preceded by a light syllable, (yá)sya. VII.32.10 has the same sequence, also in a double yásya construction. Most of the few other cadential forms are found in dimeter vs. (e.g., VIII.3.21, VIII.7.30).

The main cl. in these two vss. consists of the first two words of 13, sá sunve “he is pressed,” followed by a series of rel. cl. that fill the rest of 13 (four yáḥ clauses, all nominal, with a single predicate ānetā́and four dependent genitives) and all of 14 (three yásya clause, one yéna, with one finite verb for the yásya cl. and one for the yéna).
