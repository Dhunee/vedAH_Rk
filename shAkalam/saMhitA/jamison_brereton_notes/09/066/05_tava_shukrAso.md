This vs. seems to unite Soma’s two theatres of operation, as laid out in vss. 2-3, the cosmic and the ritual. His “gleaming rays” (reminiscent of the sun) spread both “on the back of heaven” (divás pṛṣṭhé) and across the ritual filter (pavítram); the instr. dhā́mabhiḥ “through your domains” can make reference both to this combining of cosmic and ritual and also, more specifically, to the limited ritual domains expressed by the pl. dhā́māni in vs. 3.

Renou’s characterization in his n. - “Soma-soleil …; en fait, l’image rituelle se combine avec l’image solaire” - expresses this rather nicely, though it’s hard to get it from his tr. On the likening of the soma liquid on the filter to the sun, see IX.10.5 and comm. thereon.

This tṛca does not show particular internal cohesion, but it has striking echoes of the preceding tṛca. Like vs. 1, vs. 4 begins pávasva; 4b begins abhí víśvāni like 1b, with a different acc. pl. following; 4c sákhā sákhibhya ūtáye is identical to 1c, save for the final word. Vs. 5 contains dhā́mabhiḥ echoing the two forms of dhā́man- in vss. 2-3. Only vs. 3 is free of links to the 1st tṛca.
