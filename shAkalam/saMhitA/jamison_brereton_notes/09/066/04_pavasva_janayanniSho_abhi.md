As in 1b, I supply ‘surging’ with 4b, on the basis of their identical construction.

This tṛca does not show particular internal cohesion, but it has striking echoes of the preceding tṛca. Like vs. 1, vs. 4 begins pávasva; 4b begins abhí víśvāni like 1b, with a different acc. pl. following; 4c sákhā sákhibhya ūtáye is identical to 1c, save for the final word. Vs. 5 contains dhā́mabhiḥ echoing the two forms of dhā́man- in vss. 2-3. Only vs. 3 is free of links to the 1st tṛca.
