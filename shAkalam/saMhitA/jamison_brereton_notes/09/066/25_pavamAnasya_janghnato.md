With Geldner and Renou, I supply ‘darkness(es)’ (támāṃsi) as obj. of jáṅghnataḥ on the basis of 24c.

I supply ‘drops’ with candrā́ḥ on the basis of III.40.4 candrā́sa índavaḥ, though Geldner’s “Güsse” and Renou’s “coulées de soma” certainly fit the context, too. My “drops” is indirectly supported by the additional descriptor jīrā́ḥ ‘lively’, which is most commonly found in the cmpd. jīrá-dānu- ‘having lively drops’, with a different word for drop.

Note the play jīrā́ajirá-. The cmpd ajirá-śocis- is a bit difficult to fit into context.

The 1st member ajirá- means ‘quick, nimble, agile’, and the whole bahuvrīhi occurs once elsewhere of Agni, VIII.19.13, where I tr. “of nimble flame.” How this would apply to drops is not entirely clear; I assume it refers to the propensity of drops, esp. moving drops, to catch the light. It is also possible that ajiráśociṣaḥ is gen. sg. and modifies Soma, rather than nom. pl. modifying the drops. This would not appreciably change the image.

Each vs. opens with a form of pávamāna-, which also connects it with the preceding tṛca (see above). An even stronger link to the previous tṛca is the gen. intens. part.

jáṅghnataḥ in 25a, which picks up the same stem (in the nom. jáṅghanat) at the end of the immediately preceding pāda, 24c. As for internal unity, note the free phrase háreś candrā́ḥ in 25b, which is transformed into the cmpd. háriścandra-(only here in the RV, though prominent as a PN beginning in the Br.) in 26c. Superlatives also figure in the last two vss.: rathī́tama- 26a, śubhráśastamaḥ 26b, vājasā́tama- 27b.
