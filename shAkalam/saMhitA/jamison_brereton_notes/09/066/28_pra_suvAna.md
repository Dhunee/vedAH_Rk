This vs. has two passively used participles, suvānáḥ ‘being pressed’ and punānáḥ ‘being purified’, which contrast with the agency implicitly accorded to Soma Pavamāna, “self-purifying” Soma. This more agentive participle returns in the final vs. (30b), just before we ask Soma for his favor.

The repetition of índuḥ (pādas a and c) is somewhat clumsy, but the 2nd occurrences enables the usual word play with adjacent índram.

No particular evidence of unity, except for an emphasis in the 1st two vss. on the technicalities of soma-preparation.
