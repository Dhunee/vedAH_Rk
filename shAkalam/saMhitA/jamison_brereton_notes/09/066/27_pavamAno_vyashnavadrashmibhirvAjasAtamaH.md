In this vs. we seem to have returned to the identification of Soma with the sun, as shown esp. by raśmíbhiḥ “with his rays” - this instr. pl. being reserved almost exclusively for the sun’s rays (see, e.g., nearby IX.61.8 sū́ryasya raśmíbhiḥ). The image is of the sun / Soma pervading space, with Soma’s rays being the traces of the golden liquid as it spreads across the filter.

Each vs. opens with a form of pávamāna-, which also connects it with the preceding tṛca (see above). An even stronger link to the previous tṛca is the gen. intens. part.

jáṅghnataḥ in 25a, which picks up the same stem (in the nom. jáṅghanat) at the end of the immediately preceding pāda, 24c. As for internal unity, note the free phrase háreś candrā́ḥ in 25b, which is transformed into the cmpd. háriścandra-(only here in the RV, though prominent as a PN beginning in the Br.) in 26c. Superlatives also figure in the last two vss.: rathī́tama- 26a, śubhráśastamaḥ 26b, vājasā́tama- 27b.
