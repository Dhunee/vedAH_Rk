It may not be clear in the published translation that “you” and “the inspired poet” are identical.

The referent of the “seven siblings” (saptá jāmáyaḥ) is disputed. Geldner identifies them as the fingers - and certainly jāmí- is regularly used of the fingers of the officiants in IX.

But 1) do fingers “cry out”? and more important, 2) why then “seven”? It seems unlikely that the poet would deliberately evoke an image of disfigurement or, at the very least, incompleteness. Ober (II.73; see II.71) tries to rescue this identification by suggesting that seven and ten are “equivalent” indications of totality. But as he himself notes, a number of other groups of seven are mentioned in IX. A reference to one of these in this vs. would save us from positing an defective set of fingers. The most likely referent in my view are the seven streams, saptá síndhavaḥ found two vss. earlier (6a). Rivers regularly make noise in the RV, and the proximity of that very phrase in vs. 6 tips the scales for me. Another feminine group of seven is the seven insightful thoughts, saptá dhītáyaḥ (IX.8.4, 9.4, 15.8, 62.17). dhītí- also make noise, and they also (though not explicitly numbered 7) appear several vss. later doing just that: 11c ávāvaśanta dhītáyaḥ “the insightful thoughts have bellowed.” However, supplying dhītáyaḥ here would lead to a poetically clumsy nearredundancy: the related dhī́-, also ‘insightful thought’, is found in the same clause, and “the seven (inspired thoughts) cried out to you with inspired thoughts” would be, to say the least, awk. (rather than being a pleasing etymological echo, at least to my mind). Lüders (246) also goes for streams, and Renou, citing his treatment, seems silently to endorse it. Lüders claims that Geldner identifies the seven as dhītáyaḥ, despite Geldner’s clear n. 1 “Die Finger.” I don’t see where Lüders got this - I assume it’s simply a lapse.

In IX the figure Vivasvant seems to be the prototype sacrificer (see Oldenberg ad IX.99.2), perhaps in his role as father of Manu. For further on Vivasvant see published introduction. to I.139 as well as comm. to IX.99.2, X.14.5.
