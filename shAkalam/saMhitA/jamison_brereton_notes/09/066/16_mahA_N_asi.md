title = "16"

As Renou points out, sán here is non-concessive. Instead it seems to have a function rather like the one I identified in III.30.5 (see comm. ad loc.), namely a definitional one: where, on the basis of the description of the god’s activities or qualities, he is assigned an agentive title.

The first two vss. are linked lexically and by their investment in grammatical comparison. The third is unconncected, but 18c echoes vs. 14 in the previous tṛca.
