The āmreḍita rucā́-rucā evokes the single instr. rucā́at the end of the preceding hymn, IX.64.28 (also vs. 13 of the same hymn and vs. 27 of this one).

Pāda c is characterized by alliteration of an unremarkable type: víśvā vásūny ā́viśa.

No particular signs of unity. Vss. 2 and 3 have forms of the pres. part.

pávamāna- and 3 also the impv. ā́… pavasva, but esp. in this hymn, the appearance of these forms is hardly noteworthy. Vss. 2 and 3 also have devébhyaḥ in their b pādas, but in different cases.
