īyate is assigned to √yā/ī ‘implore, beseech’ by numerous scholars, incl. Grassmann, Lubotsky, and Lüders (214-15: “Der König wird mit Liedern gebeten”), though Geldner, Renou and the published translation

take it to √yā/ī ‘speed’ (so also Sāyaṇa., who glosses gacchati). In favor of the latter, Renou declares that īyate is always “il s’avance” in IX. I would also point out 1) the king is definitely traveling in pāda c (yā́tave, to the same root) and 2) the ‘is sped’ interpr. is supported by a passage like IX.26.3 táṃ vedhā́m medháyā́hyan “They impelled the ritual adept with their wisdom” also containing an instr. of medhā́- with a clear indication of movement (ahyan). Kulikov (495-96) discusses both root possibilities without seeming to decide, though the fact that he lists it with 2 yā (ī) ‘implore, request’ probably indicates his choice.

śatagvínam gávām póṣam, lit. “thriving of cattle that possesses hundredfold cattle” (vel sim.), redundantly codes the cattle twice (-gvínam gávām).
