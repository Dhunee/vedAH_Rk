This vs. reestablishes the line of demarcation between Soma and Indra that was blurred in vs. 2, by means of the reciprocal figure devó devā́ya “the god for the god,” with the dat. further specified as índrāya.

The stem pīpáya- is ambiguous; it can be both intrans. and trans. (and at least once mixed: I.63.8; see comm. ad loc.). In this passage Geldner takes it as intrans. (“wann seine Milch quillt”). The ambiguity is in part the result of the partial coincidence of the pf. subjunctive and the redupl. aor. injunctive (or subj.) (see Kümmel 301-3), and in this passage we appear to have the trans. redupl. aor. (Kümmel 302). Partly on the basis of VIII.1.19, Oldenberg takes Indra as the subj. of trans. pīpáyat. Renou also considers the form “probably” transitive, though he does not specify the subject.
