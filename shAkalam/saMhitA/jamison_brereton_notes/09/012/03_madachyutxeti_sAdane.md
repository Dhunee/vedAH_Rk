On madacyút- and vipaścít- see, e.g., Scarlatta (128 and 122 respectively).

gaurī́is the loc. sg. to the vṛkī́-stem gaurī́-, not a dual (per Grassmann); see AiG III.170 and comm. ad VII.103.2 (sarasī́) and I.135.9 (nadī́). As indicated in the publ. intro., of the possible referents for this buffalo cow, with Geldner and Renou (see esp. Renou’s n.) I favor the hide on which the pressing apparatus is placed -- as opposed to Sāyaṇa’s ‘speech’, or Lüders’s more complex speech identified with the heavenly waters.
