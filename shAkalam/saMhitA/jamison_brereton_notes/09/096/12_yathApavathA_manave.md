As pointed out in the published introduction, this vs. is strongly marked as a hymnfinal vs., with complementary yáthā ‘even as’ (ab) and evā́‘in just this way’ (cd) clauses, bringing this 4-versed hymn to a close. The matches between clauses are more expicit than in some such structures: the two finite verbs, impf. ápavathāḥ and impv. pavasva, match exactly save for tense/mood, and the root noun cmpd. vayodhā́ḥ of pāda a is recast as a syntagm dráviṇaṃ dádhānaḥ in c with the same root √dhā.

The final pāda consists of two brief clauses, both somewhat aberrant. The first contains an idiom I have not found elsewhere, sám √sthā + LOC. My tr., “stand sideby-side by Indra,” is meant to capture this slightly off expression. The second clause, “beget/generate weapons,” is syntactically fine but semantically odd.

The first vs. of the new hymn (13a) begins pávasva (see also pavasva in 14a), just as the last vs. of the previous hymn ended with pavasva (12c). Again, this concatenation may have led to the attachment of 13-16 at this point. Of course, pávasva is hardly a rare form in this maṇḍala.
