This vs., too, gives the initial impression of a random series of elements strung together, which are difficult to construe with each other. Note, for ex., that ab contains five different nominal forms in four different cases, which cannot easily be connected. I take the vs. as a whole as a restatement of vs. 2, or an extension of it - describing the progress of Soma through his ritual preparation. The vs. is discussed at length by Oldenberg, in part responding to a treatment of it by Macdonell in JRAS 1893.

With trī́ṇi I supply ‘filters’, on the basis of IX.73.8 and IX.97.55 (see comm. ad locc.); see also the three seats (trī ṣadhásthā) in the next hymn (IX.103.2) in the same verse with sheep’s fleece filters. The same interpr. is shared by Oldenberg (tentatively) and Renou, while Geldner construes trī́ṇi with yójanā in c, which has the merit of not requiring supplied material, but the referent is fairly distant from its adj. (the basis of Oldenberg’s objection to this interpr.).

The next question is on what does gen. tritásya depend. I take it with pṛṣṭhéṣu ‘on the backs’ on the basis of IX.37.4 tritásyā́dhi sā́navi “on the back of Trita” (with a different word for ‘back’). See comm. ad IX.37.4. So also Oldenberg, while Renou construes it with both trī́ṇi and pṛṣṭhéṣu and Geldner with trī́ṇi. The displacement of tritásya from its headnoun can be easily explained by the desire to juxtapose ‘three’ and (lit.) ‘third’: trī́ṇi tritásya.

The real problem in this hemistich, however, is what to do with the impv.

érayā and the acc. rayím. The verb doesn’t fit easily into the ritual context nor does the acc. ‘wealth’. See Oldenberg for various possibilities, none of which he particularly likes. Renou makes a valiant attempt to make ab into a single cl., but the semantically and syntactically ill-suited awkwardness is apparent: “Stimule avec (ton) jet les trois (filtres) de Trita, (pour procurer) la richesse sur les (trois) dos (de Trita).” For one thing ‘stimulating’ or ‘rousing’ the filters isn’t a standard (or even non-standard) action at the soma sacrifice, and his parenthetic “(pour procurer)” glosses over the fact that rayím has no syntactic connection to the rest of the clause.

For this reason I reluctantly accept Geldner’s solution (considered but disfavored by Oldenberg), to take the impv. as part of a parenthetical clause, though I restrict that clause more than he does. He takes all of b as parenthetical: “—auf deinem Rücken bringe Reichtum her—” while I would limit it to the impv. + ACC.: —“rouse wealth!—” Although I am loath to solve syntactic problems by a wholesale positing of parentheticals, this seems the least objectionable way to deal with ab. It is not clear to me who the addressee of the impv. is, nor do any of the standard interpr.

seem to worry about this question. I very much doubt that it is Soma, who is otherwise referred to only in the 3rd ps. throughout the hymn, until the final vs.; I find it unlikely that this hymn-length consistency and the dramatic contrast created by the switch in persons in the final vs. would be violated by a seemingly irrelevant impv. just here. The most likely addressee is a ritual officiant of some sort. On a possible interpr. of the short impv. phrase see comm. on the next vs. The 2nd hemistich is, by contrast, relatively straightforward and, like 2cd, sketches the length of the territory Soma traverses, with the verb ví √mā ‘measure out’ and yójana-, a measure of distance. The preverb ví is in tmesis and takes its position after the verb at the beginning of the final, short pāda.

Trita figures in these two vss. Although the name Trita has several different referents, or at least several different roles, in the RV, in Maṇḍala IX he is the archetypal soma presser: see esp. comm. ad IX.37.4. In these two vss. there is also a play on the literal sense of tritá- ‘third’, which is played off against the dual pāṣyòḥ in 2a and the numeral trī́ṇi ‘three’ in 3a. The Anukr. ascribes this hymn to Trita Āptya, a mythical figure most prominent in X.8, but this ascription is presumably based on the occurrence of tritá- in vss. 2-3. Trita Āptya is credited with several other hymns in the RV, incl., in this maṇḍala, IX.33-34.
