Note the (s)va repetition: mádhvaḥ ... pavasva vásva ... pavasva ...

svádasva ... pavasva.

As in IX.96.14 (see comm. ad loc.), I take the acc. with pavasva as expressing a transformation of soma into the substance expressed in the acc. This use of pavasva with the acc. contrasts with that of ā́pavasvā in pādas b and d, where ā́adds the sense ‘bring here by purification’ and the acc. expresses the materials thus obtained.

On sū́da- see comm. ad VII.36.3. I argue there that, contra most views, it belongs with the ‘sweet’ words, and in fact that in this passage svádasva … pávamānaḥ in c is a virtual gloss (or poetic repair) of sū́dam pavasva in a.

The tṛca has a superficial unity from the (over-)abundance of forms of √pū, esp. in the middle vs.: pavasva 43a, 44a, 44b, 44d; pávamānaḥ 44c; punānáḥ 45c (the only form of √pū in this vs., and belonging to a different stem). Otherwise there is little to hold it together. The supposed transition between the poets Parāsara Śaktya and Kutsa Āṅgirasa happens after vs. 44, but as noted in the published introduction, this change of poets seems unlikely.
