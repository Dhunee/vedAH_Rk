Since √pū does not appear with prá, it’s best to supply a verb of motion with the prá opening pāda a and take b (with pavate) separately. Note the alliteration in pāda a … dānudó divyó dānu(-pinváḥ).

This vs. identifies Soma as ‘truth’ (ṛtám b) and also contains in c the possessive internal deriv. dharmán- to dhárman-. If I am correct that jyéṣṭhasya … dhármaṇi in the immed. preceding vs. 22b should be interpr. “on the foundation of preeminent (truth -- ṛtásya), both resonant words, ṛtá- and dhárman-/dharmán-, were already implicitly present in the previous vs. In 23 Soma is then depicted as the embodiment of these words (cf. Geldner’s “das (verkörperte) Gesetz” for ṛtám), and they define his kingship (rā́jā in c, also in 24b). Unfortunately it does not seem possible to signal the dhárman- / dharmán- connection in English tr., but ‘possessor of the (royal) mandate’ may be too specialized for the latter. Perhaps better ‘founder, foundation-giver, institutor, maintainer’. On Soma as “truth” see also IX.107.15 and IX.108.8.

The ten reins are presumably the fingers of the presser, as is usual for ten anything in IX.

These two vss. each contain the injunc. (/subj.) aor. bhuvat, which in both cases I tr. as an immed. past: “he has become.” After considerable disc. with Ian Hollenbaugh, I now think that this particular form can also express a generic or habitual role or behavior of the subject, which Ian Hollenbaugh felicitously renders with the colloquial “he be-s X.” I am therefore now inclined to alter the tr. of both vss. to “he is the king …” / “he is, now as before, the wealth-lord …” In the absence of a non-colloquial Engl.

habitual/generic, “is” will have to do.

Karṇaśrut Vāsiṣṭha, a name that has no source in the text and is not otherwise found in the Anukr. This tṛca depicts Soma as a king on a royal journey, and associates him with the resonant words ṛtá- (23b, 24d) and dhárman- (22b) / dharmán- (23c) and the traditional roles they imply.
