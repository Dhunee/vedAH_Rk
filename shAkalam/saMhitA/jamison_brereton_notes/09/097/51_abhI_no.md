Geldner again supplies “zu gewinnen” in both hemistichs. I once again see no reason to do so. He also takes the rel. cl. of c (yéna dráviṇam aśnávāma) as dependent on ā́rṣeyám: “um … uns den Namen eines R̥ṣi zu gewinnen, durch den wir zu Reichtum gelangen können.” This ignores the parallel abhí’s of cd and also assumes an embedded rel. cl. (though not all that embedded). Renou takes ārṣeyám as a 2nd obj. of aśnávāma: “afin que nous obtenions la richesse, afin l’état de Prophète …” This is somewhat less disruptive than Geldner’s, but assumes a purpose function for yéna that has no good precedent, as far as I know. My own interpr. - supplying a gapped acc. ‘that’ as antecedent for yéna -- seems minimally disruptive and assumes that the insistent structure with abhí arṣa ACC continues in this pāda. The same interpr. is found in Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 550-51): “(fliesse uns das) zu, wodurch wir Reichtum erlangen werden.” The interpr. of Geldner and Renou also minimize or ignore the only clever part of this tṛca, which provides a climax of sorts. With the pattern abhí (…) arṣa “rush towards …” inescapably established, the poet produces a phonological play on this phrase in the last pāda: abhy ārṣeyám, where the acc. goal, beginning ārṣ-, plays on the impv.

arṣa (the play also noted by Geldner, n. 51d). ārṣeyá- is found only here in the RV, though it is extremely common in Vedic prose.

In contrast to the tṛcas with faint or no signs of cohesion, this one is over-determined. The verbal lexeme that dominates is abhí √ṛṣ: the preverb abhí opens every one of the 12 pādas, and the impv. arṣa/ā is found in the first pāda of every vs. (49a, 50a, 51a). The part. pūyámānaḥ ends the first hemistich of each vs. Most of the rest of the material consists of acc. goals of motion. The goals in the first vs. of the tṛca are gods, in the first half of the 2nd vs. the substances with which Soma will be mixed, and in the rest of the tṛca those things that we want Soma to provide us. The result is a tṛca of utmost banality, enlivened by a small play of words in the last pāda.
