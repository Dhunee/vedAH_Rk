The form cakṣi (also VII.3.6) is in both of its occurrences pretty clearly an impv., but its formation is something of a puzzle. It appears to be a -si impv. (so Baum, Imperative, 46, 107, with no disc.), but it has none of the standard supports for such a form. Not only does it not have an s-aor. subjunctive, but it has no aorist forms at all, and almost all the occurrences of its well-attested root pres. are medial.

And of course, assuming it belongs to √cakṣ, the form would have to be degeminated from *cakṣ-ṣi (though that would not be hard). The parallel passage IX.71.9 has a medial injunc. to the marginal thematic stem (see Hoffmann 122 n. 33): divyáḥ suparṇó 'va cakṣata kṣā́m. I have no explanation for this aberrant form; it is true that the proper med. impv. to the root pres. cakṣva (3x) would not fit this metrical slot, but that doesn’t seem reason enough to invent cakṣi.

The first vs. of the tṛca contains a form of √sṛj, thus concatenating with the previous tṛca. Both the first (31) and last (33) vss. contain a reference to the sun, and I see one in the middle vs. as well; see comm. ad 32.
