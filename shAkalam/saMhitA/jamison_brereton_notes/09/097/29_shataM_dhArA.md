I take the hapax sanítra- in its full lexical value, as a ‘means of winning’, rather than the bleached Spende, Gabe (Grassmann), Lohn (Geldner), le bénéfice (Renou) that prevails. On the accent of the word (and other -tra-stems to seṭ roots), see AiG II.2.701-2, which also glosses the word as I do: ‘Mittel des Gewinnens’, flg. Ludwig.

Attributed to Vasukra Vāsiṣṭha, who is not otherwise known - though a Vasukra Aindra is supposedly responsible for the devilish trio of hymns X.27-29.

The tṛca is marked by the repetition of ā́pavasva in the 2nd hemistich of each vs. (28d, 29c, 30d) expressing the various good things we want Soma to bring us through his self-purification. The root √sṛj ‘surge’ is also prominent in the 2nd two vss. (29a, 30a).
