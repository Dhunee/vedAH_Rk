Again very few signs of cohesion as a whole, though the 1st and last vss. have a few echoes: rathiráḥ (46c, 48a) and a satyá-X bahuvrīhi (satyá-śuṣma46c, satyá-manman- 48d), as well as camū́- (46b, 48b). Also, assuming that the “daughter” in 47b is the Daughter of the Sun (as most do), both 46 and 47 have ref.

to the sun.
