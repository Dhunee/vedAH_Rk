pūṣéva dhījávano ‘si soma, which is, of course, a good arg. But Pūṣan doesn’t cut much of a figure in IX, does not really belong in this exalted company (Vāyu, Mitra+Varuṇa, Indra - though see the list in IX.81.4-5), and is not an appropriate referent for the other words in this pāda: náram … ratheṣṭhā̇́m. In the sg.

nṛ́- is almost always used of Indra, as are ratheṣṭhā́- and ratheṣṭhá-. I am therefore certain that c, like d, refers to Indra.

No obvious cohesion in this tṛca, though it ends with a clan refrain.
