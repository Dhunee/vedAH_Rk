On the “three voices” (tisró vā́caḥ) see comm. ad IX.33.4, 50.2.

The parallel expressions in c and d -- … yanti … PTCLE contrast the progress of ritual substance (milk) and ritual speech (thoughts). As elsewhere, vāvaśānā́ḥ could belong to both √vāś ‘bellow’ and √vaś ‘desire, be eager’ (cf. IX.93.4, 95.4).

Given the emphasis on noise in this tṛca, the former is probably primary, but both can be meant - hence my tr. “bellowing eagerly.”

All three vss. concentrate on ritual speech and on the noisy approach of both cows and poets to Soma. This theme takes up 32d, where Soma impels his own speech in concert with the productions of the poets. The final vs., 36, begins with hymn-summarizing evā́.
