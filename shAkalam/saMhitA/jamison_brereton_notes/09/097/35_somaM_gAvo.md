The first two pādas of this vs. are variants of the last two of the previous vs. (34cd), with the repeated yanti of 34 gapped, and redistribution of some of the lexicon: the two participles in 34cd, prchámānāḥ and vāvaśānā́ḥ, switch positions, with each paired with a more natural subject (cows bellowing 35a, poets asking 35b), and the thoughts of 34d are relegated to the instr. in 35b with their producers, the viprā́ḥ, taking over the subject role in 35b, again a more natural configuration. We can consider 35ab as a complex poetic repair of 34cd.

All three vss. concentrate on ritual speech and on the noisy approach of both cows and poets to Soma. This theme takes up 32d, where Soma impels his own speech in concert with the productions of the poets. The final vs., 36, begins with hymn-summarizing evā́.
