The verb vāvṛdhe in d concatenates with vardhitā́várdhanaḥ in 39a.

Geldner’s tr. of pāda a, “Der Ocean hat gebrüllt bei seiner ersten Ausbreitung,” seems to imply (though this is not a necessary interpr. of his tr.) that the samudrá- is a different entity from Soma himself, and his cited IX.107.23 tváṃ samudrám prathamó ví dhārayaḥ “You were [/are] the first to to spread out the sea” (with both samudrá- and ví √dhṛ) certainly depicts them as separate. However, IX.86.29 tváṃ samudró asi …, távemā́ḥ páñca pradíśo vídharmaṇi “You are the sea, …; yours are these five regions in your [/their] expansion” (also with samudrá- and the -n-stem loc. vídharman/-ṇi as here) asserts the identity of Soma and the samudrá-. Since forms of √krand ‘roar’ in IX (like ákrān here) have Soma as their subject (incl. in vss. 13, 18, 28, 32, 33 in this hymn), the identification of Soma and the sea seems assured here.

No particular unity detectable in the tṛca, though the 2nd two vss. do focus on Soma’s role in strengthening and exhilarating the gods.
