As Renou points out, init. asyá is reflexive or pseudo-reflexive, referring to Soma.

Grassmann attributes the instr. preṣā́to a root noun préṣ- (← pra-íṣ-). Scarlatta (59-60) discusses the form extensively, pointing out that a root noun analysis is dispreferred because of the accent on the ending: root nouns generally keeping the accent on the root even in the oblique. An instr. to a putative them. stem preṣá- is possible (at least accentually distinct from préṣa- I.68.5).

Almost identical to IX.92.6a, pāda d contains one of the few technical references to animal sacrifice (other than the horse sacrifice) in the RV.

No obvious cohesion in this tṛca, though it ends with a clan refrain.
