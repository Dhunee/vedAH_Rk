The simile in b is one of the best pieces of evidence for my interpr. of √ribh as ‘squawk, creak,’ etc., rather than ‘sing’. The simile “like birds of prey” (ná gṛ́dhrāḥ) only makes sense if the verb that expresses the sounds of the voices of the poets (kaváyaḥ) is not a mellifluous one. Both Geldner and Renou struggle with this. Geldner reduces rebhanti to ‘become hearable/known’: “… werden die Seher lautbar wie die Geier” (not the first quality one things of for a Geier); Renou simply recasts the simile: “sur sa trace ils psalmodient, comme des poètes avides (de gain).”

The rest of the hymn consists of 4 vss. Oldenberg dithers about whether this consists of an odd vs., 55, followed by a final tṛca, 56-58 - or a tṛca 55-57, with a final independent vs. 58. At least to my mind, the latter analysis is clearly superior.

Vs. 58 has the “feel” of a hymn-summary vs., with the expression of “our” wish in ab, and its 2nd half consists of the Kutsa refrain. Nonetheless, there are no clear signs of cohesion in vss. 55-57, though one might point to the filters in both 55 and 56.

Happily none of the vss. presents us with the desperate difficulties of the preceding tṛca.
