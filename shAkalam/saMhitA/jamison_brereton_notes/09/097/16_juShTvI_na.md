The vs. contrasts easy travel (a: supáthā sugā́ni) with difficult travel (c: duritā́ni); the contrast is signaled by su- / duṣ-, while two different roots for ‘go’ serve as 2nd cmpd. member, √gā (or √gam?) versus √i.

The part. kṛṇván in b should be supplied to govern supáthā sugā́ni in a.

Pace Geldner and Renou, I do not think naḥ should be construed with the ger. juṣṭvī́; it is simply in Wackernagel’s position and goes better with supáthā sugā́ni.

For the loc. uraú see III.54.9 uraú pathí.

For ghanéva see comm. ad I.63.5.

This tṛca does seem to have a controlling theme and metaphor, esp. in 17-18 -- the passage through the filter, beginning in 16. Navigating among the curly tufts is compared on the one hand to the triumphant progress of the Aryas (vs. 17) and to a sort of moral progress in discriminating between the crooked and the straight (18). Each vs. also contains a form of the impv. dhanva ‘run’ (16d, 17c, 18d).

The Anukramaṇī names Vyāghrapād (‘Tigerfoot(ed)’) Vāsiṣṭha as the poet, a colorful name with no precedent in the text.
