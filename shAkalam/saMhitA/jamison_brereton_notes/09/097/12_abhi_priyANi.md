The first pāda is alliterative: … priyā́ṇi pavate punānáḥ, while opening of the 2nd is an etymological figure that matches the one opening 11d.

The referent of priyā́ṇi, the obj. or goal of abhí … pavate, is uncertain. In the pub. tr. I supply ‘tracks’, on the basis of 7c padā́… abhy èti, as well as IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás padā́… arṣati “he rushes towards the dear tracks of heaven.” However, as noted above, I no longer think padā́in vs. 7 is an acc. pl., and I am also more moved by Geldner’s cited parallel, IX.75.1 abhí priyā́ṇi pavate ..., nā́māni “he purifies himself towards his own dear names.” But cf. also IX.57.2 abhí priyā́ṇi kā́vyā ...

arṣati. I would now be inclined to supply ‘names’ (“he purifies himself towards his own dear names”), since Soma’s progress across the ritual ground to his names is a trope (see comm. ad IX.75.1). But since there are a number of other referential possibilities for the construction abhí priyā́(ṇi), it might be best simply to tr.

“towards his own dear (things).” Pāda c is also puzzling: the phrase “clothing himself in his foundations” (dhármāṇi … vásānaḥ) is not immediately interpretable, and there are no illuminating parallels (at least that I have found). The adverbial ṛtuthā́“according to the ritual order” suggests that the process of “clothing himself” involves following the orderly steps of the sacrifice - which in turn suggests that Soma is making his progress across the ritual ground, encountering first the waters, then the milk, before arriving at his destination. I therefore think that the “foundations” here are the waters and the milk - his supports, the materials of which the soma drink is built. But this cannot be demonstrated.

This tṛca is attributed to Manyu Vāsiṣṭha, with the name possibly extracted from the previous tṛca, where manyú- in 8a is taken by some as part of a PN (see comm. above).

All three vss. contain a hemistich beginning índuḥ (10a, 11c, 12c); the verb pavate appears in all three (10a, 11b, 12a), though this is hardly unusual. In addition there is the presence of Indra (10b, 11c) or the gods in general (12b), as well as shared vocabulary: hemistich-final mádāya (10b, 11d), √pṛc ‘infuse’ (11a, 12b), \#devó devásya (11d) / #devó devā́n (12d). The net result is an impression of unity, despite the lack of a striking shared theme and the unremarkable nature of the shared material.
