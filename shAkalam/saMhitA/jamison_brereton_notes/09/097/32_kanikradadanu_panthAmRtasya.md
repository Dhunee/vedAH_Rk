The “domain for the cows” is echoed here by the “domain of the immortal one” (amṛ́tasya dhā́ma). As with the same phrase in IX.94.2 (q.v.), I suggest that the immortal one is the sun, and perhaps specifically milk as representative of the sun.

The role of the sun in the surrounding vss. (31d, 33d) supports this interpr. For alternative interpr. of the phrase, see comm. ad IX.94.2. In our passage Renou (sim. Lüders 467) suggests that it is actually nom. and refers to Soma, but in IX.94.2 it must be an acc. obj. (also acdg. to Renou).

The cadence of c is bad as transmitted, but can be easily fixed by reading

*matsarā-vān with the common lengthening of the stem vowel -a- before -vant- and
-van-; see Oldenberg, in agreement with Arnold. The stem is a hapax, and it is clearly a
morphological variant of matsarín(-tama)- (4x), with a different possessive suffix. In fact, our pāda is a nonce Triṣṭubh adaptation of the Jagatī line IX.76.5 sá índrāya pavase matsaríntamaḥ. For further disc. see comm. ad IX.76.5. The interchangeability of -vant- and -ín- for metrical purposes speaks against the two possessive suffixes having crucial functional differences.

The initial sá in both our pāda and the one on which it is based does not follow my rules for sá 2nd-ps. reference. On this aberrancy see comm. ad IX.76.5, where it can be motivated. That pāda was then simply borrowed (and slightly altered) here.

The first vs. of the tṛca contains a form of √sṛj, thus concatenating with the previous tṛca. Both the first (31) and last (33) vss. contain a reference to the sun, and I see one in the middle vs. as well; see comm. ad 32.
