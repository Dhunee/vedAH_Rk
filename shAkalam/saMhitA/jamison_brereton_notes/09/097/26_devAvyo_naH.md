The published translation omits the enclitic naḥ; it should be revised to “Pursuing the gods for us while …” Geldner takes kṣáyam in b as an Inhaltsakk. (“… sollen … ein Haus … herströmen” (sim. but more elaborate, Renou). But a dwelling place is a particularly unlikely object to “stream,” and I prefer to see it as goal (as also Scarlatta 398).

The hapax in d, diviyáj-, has (at least) two possible meanings: ‘sacrificing at day(break)’ as I take it, and ‘sacrificing (to the gods) in heaven’ (so Geldner, Renou). See Geldner’s n. and Scarlatta (398-99). There is nothing in the context that tips the balance one way or the other; I prefer the temporal reading because the other one requires more material to be understood. The word also appears in a metrically disturbed pāda; as it stands it has 12 syllables and a cadence (- ⏑ ⏑ ×) that is bad for both Triṣṭubh and Jagatī. Oldenberg suggests the possibility of reading the 1st member of diviyáj- as a monosyllable, either *divyájaḥ or *dyuyájaḥ, which would at least produce an 11-syl.

line, and these possibilities are disc. in more detail by Scarlatta without a firm conclusion.

Like the tṛca 19-21, this one focuses in great part on the gods as drinkers of soma and the desire to bring them to the ritual; the “pursuit” (vītím) of Indra and Vāyu in 25b is reprised in devā-vī́- ‘pursuing the gods’ in 26a, while the gods are mentioned twice in 27ab. The final vs. also begins with the typical hymnsummarizing evā́as three times elsewhere in this hymn (vss. 13-15, 19-21, 34-36).

The poet is named as Mṛḍīka Vāsiṣṭha, who is also the poet of X.150. In the latter hymn his name is clearly drawn from the dat. mṛḍīkā́ya found in the refrain of every vs., but there is no such basis here.
