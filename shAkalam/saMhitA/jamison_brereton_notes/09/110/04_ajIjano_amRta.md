Though the meter changes here, vss. 3 and 4 are knit together by initial ájījanaḥ. Here the obj. is left unspecified and presumably re-supplies the obj. of 3.

Renou notes the play between ā́m̐ṛtásya and amṛ́tasya, which might suggest that the anunāsika sometimes inserted after final vowels at the end of a pāda to prevent coalescence with the following initial vowel is not merely a redactional addition, as Oldenberg (Proleg. 470) asserts.

Geldner (n. 4b) identifies amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇaḥ as a reference to the drink of immortality, namely soma. In this I think he is correct; see comm. ad IX.70.2.

However, he also wants it to be a type of partitive genitive (“eine Art von Genit.

partit.”) dependent on ájījanaḥ; it is difficult to imagine what sort of partitive gen. could be construed with ‘beget’. I see no reason why this gen. cannot depend on dhárman as ṛtásya does (Sāyaṇa.’s solution).

A very challenging tṛca, esp. the last two vss.
