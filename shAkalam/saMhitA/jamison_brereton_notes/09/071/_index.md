On the structure of this hymn see published introduction. As indicated there, it is structured as a series of more or less concentric responsions. These include āsádam 1a / 6b; ní riṇite 2a / ā́… riṇanti 6c; várṇam … asya tám 2b / várṇo asya sá 8a; girā́ 3c / 6c; násate 3c / 8d - as well as others less narrowly lexical. However, these responsions don’t seem to define an omphalos.

The hymn continues the preoccupation with the clothing and coverings that Soma assumes in the course of the ritual preparation, particularly in the first two and last two vss.
