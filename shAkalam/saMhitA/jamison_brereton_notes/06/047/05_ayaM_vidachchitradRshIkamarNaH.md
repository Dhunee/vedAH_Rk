Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition divide the 2nd hemistich as … skámbhanenód # di yā́m, with úd the final of pāda a and di yā́m distracted and pāda-initial. But this is clearly wrong: úd is a preverb in tmesis with astabhnāt and should open the pāda, and dyā́m is rarely if ever distracted. Lubotsky’s division is correct.

As noted above, the 2nd hemistich of this vs. sounds esp. Indraic.

As noted in the published introduction. as well as above, the praise of soma modulates towards praise of Indra in this sequence, starting in the 2nd half of vs. 3. The first half of 3 clearly identifies soma as referent with the ppl. pītáḥ ‘when drunk’, but the cosmogonic deeds of 3d and of at least the first half of 4 begin to sound Indraic. We are brought abruptly back to soma in 4d (sómo dādhāra), but this almost seems like a trick or a feint to keep us from drifting further. And vs. 5 again sounds Indraic, esp.

the final vṛṣabhó marútvān “the bull accompanied by the Maruts”: marútvant- is overwhelmingly an epithet of Indra. For a similar nearby sequence of vss. that oscillates between soma and Indra (and also uses ayám as an organizing word) see VI.44.22-24 and comm. ad loc. </details>
