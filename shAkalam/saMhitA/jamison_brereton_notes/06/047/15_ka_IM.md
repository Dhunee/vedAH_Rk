Geldner renders d exactly opposite to the published translation: “so macht er den Vorderen zum Hintermann” (fld. by Klein, “āmreḍitas”: “he makes the one at the fore into one who lags behind”). But the simile in c is about walking one step at a time (“putting his two feet down one after the other”), and unless Indra is walking backwards my interpr. must be correct. It’s true that pū́rvam ‘in front’ precedes áparam ‘behind’ in the text, but word order is scarcely a reliable guide in the RV, esp. since in nominal sentences we often get PREDICATE SUBJECT order. (Furthermore, there's a sort of iconic ordering of the two adjectives, with pū́rva- first, which can be independent of the larger sense.)

As noted in the published introduction, this section, which concerns Indra’s fickle attentions to various clients in turn, is marked grammatically by āmreḍitas and intensives (i.e., iterative/frequentatives), expressing the constantly shifting nature of the actions and their objects. See the published introduction. for the continuity of content I see in this section.
