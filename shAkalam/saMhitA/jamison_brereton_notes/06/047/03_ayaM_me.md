It is not clear what noun to supply with fem. pl. urvī́ḥ, though something like ‘worlds (so Geldner), realms’ makes sense. The same ṣáḍ urvī́ḥ is found in X.14.16 in unclear context, and as a voc. in X.128.5 dévīḥ ṣaḍ urvīḥ 'you six broad goddesses’, again with uncertain referent. Elsewhere urvī́ḥ applies to waters or rivers, but liquid doesn’t seem appropriate here. Perhaps in our vs. it’s evoking a pl. of pṛthivī́ ‘earth’, with a pun on a different word for ‘broad’, urú-, urvī́-. Note that pṛthivī́- occurs in the next vs., dependent on varimán- ‘expanse’, which is derivationally related to urú-.

As noted in the published introduction. as well as above, the praise of soma modulates towards praise of Indra in this sequence, starting in the 2nd half of vs. 3. The first half of 3 clearly identifies soma as referent with the ppl. pītáḥ ‘when drunk’, but the cosmogonic deeds of 3d and of at least the first half of 4 begin to sound Indraic. We are brought abruptly back to soma in 4d (sómo dādhāra), but this almost seems like a trick or a feint to keep us from drifting further. And vs. 5 again sounds Indraic, esp.

the final vṛṣabhó marútvān “the bull accompanied by the Maruts”: marútvant- is overwhelmingly an epithet of Indra. For a similar nearby sequence of vss. that oscillates between soma and Indra (and also uses ayám as an organizing word) see VI.44.22-24 and comm. ad loc. </details>
