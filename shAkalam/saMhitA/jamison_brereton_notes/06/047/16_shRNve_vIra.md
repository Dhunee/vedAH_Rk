In d víśaḥ … manuṣyā̀n do not match in gender. Oldenberg suggests that the latter might be gen. pl., and Geldner’s tr. as such: “die Stämme der Menschen.” I see no reason not to take it as the acc. pl. it appears to be, as a parallel obj. to víśaḥ, not a modifier.

As noted in the published introduction, this section, which concerns Indra’s fickle attentions to various clients in turn, is marked grammatically by āmreḍitas and intensives (i.e., iterative/frequentatives), expressing the constantly shifting nature of the actions and their objects. See the published introduction. for the continuity of content I see in this section.
