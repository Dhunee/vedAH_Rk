The pū́rva-/ápara- binary returns from 15, but here I think it not only refers to those ahead and behind positionally (as there), but also has a temporal sense (not represented in the published translation): his previous allies in pāda a he dumps in favor of newer ones in b.

The hapax ánānubhūtīḥ is not entirely clear, but two things must be kept in mind: 1) it’s a fem. pl., presumably acc.; 2) its sense must be derived from ánu √bhū, which generally means ‘come close to, give way to’. Because of 1), it should modify śarádaḥ ‘autumns’, a fem. cons. stem (so Geldner). But Geldner’s rendering “dass sie an ihm nicht wahrgenommen werden” seems distant in sense from the verbal lexeme; Oldenberg’s “(alles) Sichnichtanschliessen …” seems closer. I take the cmpd as a bahuvrīhi meaning ‘having no intimacy’ and interpr. it as proleptic in an expression of purpose: Indra shakes off the years so that they do not come close/attach themselves to him.

(Geldner’s “dass sie … nicht …” has the same proleptic purpose interpr.) The point is that one can’t get old if one keeps the years at a distance; my “close in” is meant to capture the slangy tone of the passage (see also “double-cross” in b).

As noted in the published introduction, this section, which concerns Indra’s fickle attentions to various clients in turn, is marked grammatically by āmreḍitas and intensives (i.e., iterative/frequentatives), expressing the constantly shifting nature of the actions and their objects. See the published introduction. for the continuity of content I see in this section.
