The awkward ‘strongness’ in English tr. is meant to represent the difference between ójas- ‘strength’ in pāda a, the standard nominal abstract to this root, and ojmán-, found only here in the RV, though attested in subsequent Vedic texts. Although the ref. to the chariot in vs. 26 is hardly transparent, in this vs. it has become a barely solvable riddle. In particular, “the strongness of the waters enclosed by cows” (apā́m ojmā́nam pári góbhir ā́vṛtam) could not be interpr. without 26a, c: the “strongness of the waters” is presumably the tree (vánas-páti- in 26a, 27b), or rather the wood of the tree -- so called because plants grow only when watered.

“Enclosed by cows” recalls 26c “knotted together with cows’ (hide)” (góbhiḥ sáṃnaddhaḥ), referring to the leather that binds the wooden parts.
