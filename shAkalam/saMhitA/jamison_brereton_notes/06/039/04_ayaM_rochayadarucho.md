Whether the referent of the ‘unshining’ (arúcaḥ) is the same as that of the ‘unlit’ (adyútaḥ) of 3a, namely the nights (aktū́n 3a), is unclear. Hoffmann suggests so, with ?, and I see nothing against it. Both adyút- and arúc- are hapaxes in the RV, so we can’t bring to bear other usages of these words.

Geldner (explicitly n. 2b) considers ṛtayúj- here as having a different sense from the same cmpd. in vs. 2: “mit dem Recht im Bunde” (2b) versus “mit den rechtzeitig geschirrten Rossen” (4c). Even if ṛtá- ever had the sense ‘timely, punctual’ (which it does not), it is inconceivable to me that in a hymn of this length, the poet would use the same cmpd. in two very different senses, within two vss. of each other and marking the boundaries of an omphalos. Schmidt (149) also considers this unlikely, though he attributes the contrary view to Lüders, who, as far as I can see, doesn’t hold it or at least explicitly state it; Scarlatta (425) temporizes in his disc., though he tr.

the other three instances of ṛtayúj- (incl. our vs. 4), all modifying ‘horses’, with the anodyne ‘wohlgeschirrten’, as opposed to our vs. 2, which he renders ‘der Verbündete des Ṛta’ -- in other words, implicitly following Geldner’s differentiation. I would alter the published translation from “whose yoke is truth” to “yoked with truth,” as in vs. 2.

As noted in the published introduction. (and see comm. ad VI.38.2-4 above), the three middle verses are marked by repeated use of the near deictic in pāda-initial position, beginning every hemistich but 2cd and coming to a crescendo in vs. 4 with three iterations: ayám 2a, ayám 3a, imám 3c, ayám 4a, b, c. The unidentified referent of all these deictic forms is soma — see Oldenberg’s disc. — but soma at least partially identified with Indra, as the opener of the Vala cave. The repeated use of the deitic, pointing to something in the immediate vicinity of the speaker, focuses on soma as the ritual substance on the sacrificial ground.

The three vss. also share an etymological figure type, with transitive (/causative) verb taking a negated object to the same root: 2c rujád árugṇam, 3a dyotayad adyútaḥ, 4a rocayad arúcaḥ. And the presence of the preverb ví in pādainterior in each vs. (2c, 3a, 4b) is another shared feature.

On vss. 3-4 see Hoffmann, Injunk. 142-43.
