The identity of ayám as soma is fixed by índuḥ ‘drop’ towards the end of b, but not until fairly late in this sequence. The play of índu- and índra- so prominent in Maṇḍala IX is found here in their adjacency at the end of the hemistich.

As noted in the published introduction. (and see comm. ad VI.38.2-4 above), the three middle verses are marked by repeated use of the near deictic in pāda-initial position, beginning every hemistich but 2cd and coming to a crescendo in vs. 4 with three iterations: ayám 2a, ayám 3a, imám 3c, ayám 4a, b, c. The unidentified referent of all these deictic forms is soma — see Oldenberg’s disc. — but soma at least partially identified with Indra, as the opener of the Vala cave. The repeated use of the deitic, pointing to something in the immediate vicinity of the speaker, focuses on soma as the ritual substance on the sacrificial ground.

The three vss. also share an etymological figure type, with transitive (/causative) verb taking a negated object to the same root: 2c rujád árugṇam, 3a dyotayad adyútaḥ, 4a rocayad arúcaḥ. And the presence of the preverb ví in pādainterior in each vs. (2c, 3a, 4b) is another shared feature.

On vss. 3-4 see Hoffmann, Injunk. 142-43.
