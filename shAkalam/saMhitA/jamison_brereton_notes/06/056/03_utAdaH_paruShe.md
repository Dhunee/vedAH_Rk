As noted in the published introduction, the content of this vs. is quite baffling, though the syntax and, for the most part, the lexicon are not. Geldner (n. 3) pronounces it a “dunkler Sagenzug,” and I can only agree. I have argued that it is connected with the even more baffling VI.48.17 (see comm. there) and that these two passages associate Pūṣan with the “tearing off the Sun’s wheel” myth that remains tantalizingly out of our reach. But this must remain speculation.

The paruṣé gávi tr., “in ‘the gray cow’,” is of course masc., so should perhaps be “gray bull,” though I meant cow=bovine. The phrase is reminiscent of V.27.5 paruṣā́ḥ … ukṣánaḥ “gray bulls/oxen,” but that phrase is in a dānastuti and does not help us with the metaphor here. For another possible - if extremely tenuous - connection see comm. ad X.5.5.

There is general consensus (Geldner, Renou, Klein loc. cit.) that Indra is the subject of both of these vss., with Pūṣan appearing only as the instr. companion in 2b. By contrast, I consider Pūṣan the “best charioteer” (rathī́tamaḥ in 2a and 3c), because in the immediately preceding hymn rathī́- (VI.55.1c), rathī́tama- (VI.55.2a) are unequivocally used of Pūṣan. My interpr. requires that the subject change from 2a to 2bc, where Indra is indeed the subject, but see the anyáḥ … anyáḥ construction in the next hymn (VI.57.2, cf. 3) where the two gods each appear contrastively in the nominative. This interpr. also has the advantage that Pūṣan doesn’t disappear in the middle of his own hymn.
