It is worth noting that in the temporally contrastive rel. clauses (a: purā́ ‘previously’, b: nūnám ‘now’) whose joint predicate is the grdv. hávyaḥ (see above), the one with past reference has an overt copula, pf. ā́sitha, while the one with current reference has the copula gapped.

These vss. form a syntactic pair characterized by simple enjambment.

Both vss. begin tám u tvā, with the iteration of this phrase in 11a still part of the main clause of vs. 10 (and the object of 10c áhūmahi). The rest of the first hemistich of 11 consists of two rel. clauses, whose predicate (the predicate for both clauses), hávyaḥ, is found at the beginning of c. The rest of c is a separate impv. clause. Although the content of these two vss. is banal in the extreme, the syncopated effect produced by having the syntactic units not conform to metrical units gives it a bit of oomph. The vs. pair is unified by the ‘call’ motif: 10c áhūmahi ‘we have called upon’, 11c hávyaḥ ‘to be called upon’ / hávam ‘call’. The root √śru also provides unity: 10c śravasyávaḥ ‘seeking fame’, 11c śrudhī ‘hear’, also, in 12b śravā́yyān ‘worthy of fame’.
