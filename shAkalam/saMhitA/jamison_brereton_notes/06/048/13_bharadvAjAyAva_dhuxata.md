With Geldner I take dhukṣata, identical save for the accent to dhúkṣata in 12b, as a 2nd pl. act. impv., not a 3rd sg. mid. injunc. In a n. (13a) Geldner allows the possibility of the latter analysis, which would produce the paradox that a cow is milking a cow.

Renou opts for this latter analysis -- the cow milking herself. Although I am always quick to see paradox in the RV, in this case I think the poet is playing with morphology instead, while bringing the final vs. of this 3-vs. sequence back to the 2nd pl. impvs. of vs. 11.

Note the direct object in balanced coordination, NOUN ca ADJ / NOUN ca ADJ, with both ca-s properly positioned (unlike 10cd above) and with each bahuvrīhi epithet having the shape viśvá-CoCasam.
