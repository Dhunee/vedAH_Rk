The published translation renders dhúkṣata as if it were a subjunctive (“will milk out”; sim. Geldner) to an s-aor., but the form must be an injunctive to a sa-aor., given the augmented forms ádhukṣata, etc., and the sec. ending -ta. Of course, the injunc.

could be used modally, but a presential “who milks out” might be better.
