In b ghóṣāt is morphologically ambiguous: it can be a subjunctive to the them. pres. ghóṣa- (accented because first in its pāda) or the abl. to the them. noun ghóṣa- (so Grassmann). For possible interpr. involving this abl., see Oldenberg By contrast I follow Geldner (and Lubotsky) in taking it as a verb form, parallel to tanyati later in the pāda. The major problem this interpr. poses is how to construe gen. índrasya. Under the abl.

interpr. of ghóṣāt, the gen. is dependent on that noun, but without that support it must find another role in the following clause (to which it must belong, because tanyati is unaccented and cannot start a new clause). With Geldner (n. 2b) I take it as loosely construed with bruvāṇáḥ, though in a different sense from Geldner’s “der sich zu Indra Bekennende” -- rather as the topic of the speech.

As for the subject of ghóṣāt and tanyati, I think it anticipates the deváhūti- of c. This of course creates a problem of its own, in that bruvāṇáḥ should be fem. if deváhūti- is the referent. But given the poet’s general evasiveness about referents, I think in b we’re dealing with an as-yet-unidentified verbal product, which is then specified as deváhūti- (the same índra-hūti- of 1b) in c.

As noted in the published introduction, I think vs. 2 functions as complementary to 1: in the first vs. the índra-hūti- is conveyed up to Indra (presumably in heaven); in 2 he

-- and his ears -- are brought down here to the devá-hūti- performed at the sacrifice.

After the absence of overt referents in vs. 1, starting with 2b we have a form of índra- in every hemistich through vs. 4 (2b índrasya, 2d índram, 3b índram, 3d índre, 4a índram, 4d índram). His name is again absent in the final vs. of the hymn, vs. 5, suggesting that this pattern is deliberate and a species of ring composition, marked by absence not presence. The next hymn (VI.39) also shows this structure, with the three middle verses (2-4) united by the shared initial deictic ayám and the first and last (1, 5) standing out against this pattern.
