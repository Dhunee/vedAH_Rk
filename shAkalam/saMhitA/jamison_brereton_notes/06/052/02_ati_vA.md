nínitsāt is an unusual formation: a subjunctive to a desiderative. It may lend immediacy to the action, which is to be taken against a formulation that is being performed (note the pres. part. kriyámāṇam).

Oldenberg, Geldner, and Renou all take vṛjinā́ni as a nominalized adjective (“seine Falschheiten,” etc.), modified by or identified with tápūṃṣi (e.g., Geldner “dem mögen seine Falschheiten zu Feuerflammen werden”), rather than simply as an adjective. It would be possible to tr. it adjectivally (“for him let there be twisting, scorching [flames]”). In the published translation I chose to render vṛjinā́ni both ways, as a nominalized adj.

(‘twisted [ways]’) and as an adj. ‘twisting’ characterizing the flames. In this way the punishment fits the crime. Note that vṛjiná- was used twice in the preceding hymn, VI.51.2, 13.

It is unfortunately impossible to capture in Engl. the play between ánu √man ‘concede’ (1a) and áti √man ‘disdain’ (2a), with the further echo of áti in atiyā́já- (1d).
