The first hemistich here does assay a little figure: ṛtā- ṛtú- across the pāda boundary.

The use of yújya- in c is not entirely clear to me. I take it to mean that the offering, the milk (páyaḥ), is ritually associated with the calls (hávana-) the gods are hearing. Cf. VI.3.8. Geldner and Renou think that the association is between the substance and the gods.

These two tṛcas (7-9, 10-12) are in Gāyatrī, and the first tṛca esp. is an elementary production, with almost no tricks (though see vs. 9). One wonders whether great swaths of RV-period poetry were similarly lackluster and therefore not generally preserved.
