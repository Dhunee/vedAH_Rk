The instr. of ab, in two semantic sets -- Heaven and Earth, sacrifice and ritual labors -- apparently are the entities that the speaker swears by.

The vs., at least its 2nd hemistich, has a slangy feel -- with the unusual phonology of the root √ubj ‘crush’ and the lexeme ní √hā ‘be bent double’ (in my rendering), found elsewhere only in a curse in the Anhangslied VII.104.10.

The agent noun yaṣṭár- seems like a potential candidate for the role of technical term for ‘Sacrificer’, which was rejected in favor of yájamāna-.

It is unfortunately impossible to capture in Engl. the play between ánu √man ‘concede’ (1a) and áti √man ‘disdain’ (2a), with the further echo of áti in atiyā́já- (1d).
