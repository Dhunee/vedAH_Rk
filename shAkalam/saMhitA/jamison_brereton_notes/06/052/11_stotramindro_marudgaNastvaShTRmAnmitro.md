This vs. is essentially parallel to vs. 10: various gods are to enjoy both verbal and material offerings, with the verb stem juṣá- ‘enjoy’ held constant. Vs. 10 has an impv. juṣántām, but our vs. an injunc. juṣanta. The latter may be a substitute for the impv. in a metrical situation that favors a light final syl.

These two tṛcas (7-9, 10-12) are in Gāyatrī, and the first tṛca esp. is an elementary production, with almost no tricks (though see vs. 9). One wonders whether great swaths of RV-period poetry were similarly lackluster and therefore not generally preserved.
