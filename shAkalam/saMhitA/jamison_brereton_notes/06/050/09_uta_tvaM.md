“within (the sphere of)” is an attempt to render the loc. rātaú, since “Might I always be in your giving” is hard to parse. Klein’s (DGRV I.422) “Might I be ever (present) at thy giving” is more elegant. I might emend the published translation to “Might I always be (there) at your giving.”

These three vss. contain a series of perfect optatives, jagamyāt (8b), vavṛtyāt (9b), jagmyātam (10a), but they do not show any peculiarities of register or usage. The connection among the vss. is also signaled by utá, which opens the second two. Klein (DGRV I.424) notes the co-occurrence of the “optative series” (he does not mention that they are belong to the pf.) and the utá’s.
