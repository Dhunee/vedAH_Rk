With Geldner and Renou, I take the simile uṣáso ná prátīkam as a nominative phrase, matching the subject Savitar. Since the dakṣiṇās are distributed at dawn and Dawn is therefore associated with munificence, her face (= her light) can be characterized as a discloser of valuables. However, it would also be grammatically possible to take it as acc., with Savitar disclosing valuables as if disclosing the face of Dawn, though I think this less likely.

These three vss. contain a series of perfect optatives, jagamyāt (8b), vavṛtyāt (9b), jagmyātam (10a), but they do not show any peculiarities of register or usage. The connection among the vss. is also signaled by utá, which opens the second two. Klein (DGRV I.424) notes the co-occurrence of the “optative series” (he does not mention that they are belong to the pf.) and the utá’s.
