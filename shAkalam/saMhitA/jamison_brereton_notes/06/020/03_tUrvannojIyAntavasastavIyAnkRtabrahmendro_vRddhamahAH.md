The published translation takes Indra as the subj. of ā́vat in d, with dartnúm an action noun “when he aided the splitting …” But, on the basis of other -(t)nú-stems (cf. AiG II.2.696-97 and 741-42), dartnú- is more likely verbal/agentive (‘splitting, splitter’) and the subject of ā́vat should then be soma (“the somian honey” mádhu- sómyá-).

So explicitly Oldenberg (ZDMG 55.326, with convincing parallels; Geldner appears to follow, though his tr. is more equivocal. I would therefore change the tr. to “when it [=soma] aided the splitter of all the strongholds.”
