The first hemistich is notable for the superlative etymological figures: double śáviṣṭham … śávaḥ “strongest strength” (or, in fact, triple, since śūra ‘hero’ is ultimately related to these words) and triple ójiṣṭham ójaḥ … ugrám “mightiest mighty might.” The triple etym. connection of the first phrase is better conveyed by Geldner’s “Bring uns, du Starker, die stärkste Stärke” than by the published translation Note also that the adjacent words in b ójo abhibhūta “… might, o overpowering one,” though not syntactically connected here, form a bahuvrīhi modifying Indra in the preceding hymn, VI.18.1 abhíbhūti-ojas- ‘of overpowering strength’.

As noted in the published introduction, all three of these vss. contain the phrase “bring here to us”: in 6a and 7b na ā́bhara straddles the early caesura; in 8a ā́no bhara opens the vs. Since vss. 6-8 are the middle vss. of this hymn, this repeated phrase might identify an omphalos, but if so it is quite a weak one. The vss. are not particular noteworthy for their content, and the enclosing vss. do not provide the usual frame structure.
