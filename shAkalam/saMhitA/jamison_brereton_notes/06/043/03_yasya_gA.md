This vs. subtly undermines the autonomous power of Indra. In the refrain of all three vss. Indra is addressed as svadhāpate ‘lord of independent power’, but here in the first hemistich Indra is said to be like (ná) “one grown strong by (his own) power,” like “one overpowering by his own forms of help” (svā́bhir ūtíbhih). In other words the power that appears to be Indra’s own (svá-) is really produced for him by soma.

In the refrain of pādas cd, the position of sá and of the unaccented elements indra te strongly suggests that the clause begins in the middle of c -- or rather that sómaḥ sutáḥ has been extraclausally topicalized. Although in vss. 1-2 this nom. phrase could belong to the rel. clause of ab, that prospect is foreclosed in vs. 3, because soma is represented in the rel. cl. of 3ab by the instr. yéna.

I do not understand why this refrain contains an overt form of the copula ásti.

Outside of dependent clauses, overt asti is generally an existential, but that function is highly unlikely here. In addition to the refrain that unifies all three vss. of this tṛca, the three vss.

are structured by rel. clauses in ab with soma as the referent of the rel. prn.
