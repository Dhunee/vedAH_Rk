As Geldner points out, this must be a ref. to the three soma-pressings: the “middle and end” are respectively the Midday Pressing and the Third Pressing; the “sharp-pressed” refers to the freshly pressed soma of the Morning Pressing, which must be especially pungent.

In the refrain of pādas cd, the position of sá and of the unaccented elements indra te strongly suggests that the clause begins in the middle of c -- or rather that sómaḥ sutáḥ has been extraclausally topicalized. Although in vss. 1-2 this nom. phrase could belong to the rel. clause of ab, that prospect is foreclosed in vs. 3, because soma is represented in the rel. cl. of 3ab by the instr. yéna.

I do not understand why this refrain contains an overt form of the copula ásti.

Outside of dependent clauses, overt asti is generally an existential, but that function is highly unlikely here. In addition to the refrain that unifies all three vss. of this tṛca, the three vss.

are structured by rel. clauses in ab with soma as the referent of the rel. prn.
