Bloomfield (ad V.6.5) proposes tr. our passage “We bring ... oblation with song fashioned in the mind,” suggesting that “the cases of ṛcā́and havíḥ are inverted.” This is certainly true at the level of deep-structure formula: hṛdā́taṣṭá- “fashioned by the heart” normally modifies a verbal product, e.g. I.171.2 stómo hṛdā́taṣṭáḥ. But, as so often, the poet is playing with our expections by producing a twist on the standard phraseology.

This long hymn (or the short final tṛca) seems to end with a buried poetic signature: 47b ends with bharāmasi, 48c with vājínā, the last word of the hymn. Together they are the elements that make up the poet’s name Bharadvāja.</details>
