On the ritual use of the lotus and the relevance of this vs., see Krick (Feuergründung, 155-59), where (155) she calls this vs. “die Primärquelle für die Verwendung eines Lotusblattes im Feuerritual.” In c vāghátaḥ can be gen. sg. or nom. pl. (as I take it, with Geldner and Renou). Since I don’t know what’s going on here, I would certainly not exclude the gen. sg.: “… (churned) from the head of every vāghát” (so Krick 297) It is perhaps relevant that víśvasya vāghátaḥ phonologically echoes víśvasya jágataḥ “of the whole world” (I.101.5, IV.13.3, VI.50.7, VII.60.2, 101.2, X.73.8).

Another tṛca with fronted ‘you’ beginning all three vss., though here the 2nd two occurrences actually involve the enclitic with preposed pronominal prop: 14-15 tám u tvā, as opposed to 13 tvā́m. This tṛca is also characterized by snippets of mythology, contrasting with the otherwise monotonous focus on the standard ritual tropes. Unfortunately the snippets are just that -- they remain undeveloped.

This tṛca is recited in śrauta ritual during the churning of the fire; see Krick (Feuergründung, 297)
