As I have discussed elsewhere (Sacrificed Wife, 176-84), śraddhā́- in Vedic is not simply an abstract ‘trust, faith’, but refers specifically to trust in the efficacy of ritual and hospitality, and indeed to the concrete manifestations of this trust through ritual gift-giving. The plural śraddhā́bhiḥ here, paired with sómaiḥ, seems to refer to the offerings themselves.

On sácā see comm. ad vs. 4.

Pāda d contains a fine sequence of alliterative sibilants of all three types: ṣaṣtíṃ sahasrā śácyā sácā han.
