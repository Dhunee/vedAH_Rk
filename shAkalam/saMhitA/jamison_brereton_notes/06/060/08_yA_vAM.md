I follow Geldner in construing dāśúṣe with sánti (“which are for the pious”) rather than with puruspṛ́haḥ (Renou “pour l’adorateur les très enviés”) because puruspṛ́h- doesn’t seem to appear with a dat. elsewhere. See the almost identical IV.47.4.

8c and 9a differ minimally from each other, and it is difficult to see an aspectual (or other) distinction between root aor. impv. ā́gatam and pres. impv. ā́ gachatam -- though of course there may be a nuance we cannot catch. Note also 14b úpa gachatam and 15c ā́gatam.
