I do not have a view on how (or whether) to fix the meter of pāda a; see Oldenberg

It is thinkable, but by no means necessary, that instead of reading quadrisyllabic índrā-agnī (as in vss. 5, 7, 14), we could read trisyllabic índrāgnī (as in 8, 9, 15) with a haplologized enclitic naḥ: índrāgnī ná *no mardhataḥ.

Note the phonological (and partly etymological) figure mardh(ataḥ) (4c), mṛ́dh(aḥ) (5a), mṛḷ(ātaḥ) (5c).
