On the insistent ubhā́see published introduction.

I have taken āhuvádhyai (and mādayádhyai) as predicated infinitives with the subj. ubhā́, as does Renou However, vām in pāda a makes some difficulties for this interpr., and Geldner takes that pāda (but not b) as having an implicit 1st ps. subj.: “euch beide … will ich herrufen” (a) versus “beiden sollen sich … erfreuen” for mādayádhyai (b). I think the two clauses should be parallel and therefore take vām as a dependent gen. on ubhā́(“both of you two”), although it must be admitted that ubhá- generally agrees with its referent in case.

On the connection of these vss. to the hymn, see published introduction. For the ring composition between the 1st tṛca and this one, note the verbal responsion vasavyà- (1, 14), rā́dhas- (3, 13), vājayántā (1) and vā́jasya sātáye (14).
