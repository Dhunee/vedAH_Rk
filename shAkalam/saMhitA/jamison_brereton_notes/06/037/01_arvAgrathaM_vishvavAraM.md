I take svàrvān as implicitly conjoined with kīríḥ, with the pair displaying the range of mortals who call upon Indra. This is one of Oldenberg’s suggestions; alternatively he suggests that it is proleptic, but this seems overly complex — though it seems to underlie Geldner’s interpr.: “denn auch die Arme ruft dich erleuchtet.”
