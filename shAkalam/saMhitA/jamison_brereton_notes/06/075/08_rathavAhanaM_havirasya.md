I follow Geldner in accepting the view of the comm. to VS XXIX.45 that háviḥ is a shortening of havirdhāna- ‘oblation-deposit’, with the √dhā supplied by the definition found in the next pāda, containing níhitam ‘deposited’. However, see Oldenberg in particular for other ways to interpr. háviḥ.

The standard tr. take úpa … sadema as transitive with the chariot as object: e.g., Geldner “setzen,” Renou (Hymnes spéc.) “installer,” Doniger “place,” Oberlies (II.223) “setzen.” But úpa √sad is a standard locution for ‘reverently approach, do honor to’, and that surely is the sense here (so Griffith, Maurer “hono(u)r”).
