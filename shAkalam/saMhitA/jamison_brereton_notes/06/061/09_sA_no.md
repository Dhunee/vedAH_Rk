The various tr. (Geldner, Renou, Klein [DGRV I.402]) supply a verb in pāda a, reserving átan (c) for bc. I do not see why. Both Geldner (n. 9a) and Renou do allow for the possibility that átan has domain over the whole vs., but both identify that possible constr. as a zeugma. Again, I don’t see why -- while it is true that hatreds and rivers are different kinds of entities, mingling of the mental and the physical is standard practice in the RV.

Because of its position within the NP víśvā áti dvíṣaḥ, áti is probably not a preverb in tmesis, but rather an adposition. This view is supported by the fact that there are no other exx. of áti √tan in the RV (as Renou points out) or elsewhere, at least acdg. to Mon-Wms.

The position of anyā́ḥ identifies the sisters as a defined and limited group, and of course, as the next vs. states (10b saptásvasā), Sarasvatī has precisely seven sister rivers.

Unlike the preceding tṛca, this one dispenses with repetition and therefore has more room for meat, comparatively speaking.
