The first pāda is a bare variant of 3d: both contain the complex verbal construction vṛdhé √bhū ‘be for strengthening / be there to strengthen’, each with the complement enclitic naḥ. The only difference is the placement of the impv.: initial bhávā in 3d, final bhava in 11a, differing only in accent and, possibly, in the length of the final vowel: the Pp. resolves the cross-pāda sandhi bhavéndra with short bhava, like 10d, but a long vowel would be equally possible.

This pragātha shows both internal and external connections. As in the previous pragātha the 2nd vs. is syntactically dependent on the first, with the yátra clause of 12ab parallel to the yád clause of 11cd and both subordinate to the imperatival clause of 11b. In addition the first and last hemistichs (11ab, 12cd) open identically, with ádha smā, which echoes ádha smā of the last hemistich of the previous pragātha (10cd).

On the particular connection of vs. 12 with vs. 9 see immed. below.
