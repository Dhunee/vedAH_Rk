The pleonastic+++(=redundant)+++ máhi … mahitvám “great greatness” may be in service of phonological play: máhi tád vām is echoed in abbreviated form by immediately following mahitvám.

The (near?) synonyms sū́ryam and svàr are found as the obj. of the same verb vividáthuḥ in c. I have followed Lüders (191) in tr. the first as ‘sun’ and the 2nd as ‘sunlight’ (“Sonne … Sonnenlicht”), which is almost the same as Geldner’s “Sonne … Himmelslicht,” but preserves the lexical similarity better. Renou prefers ‘ciel’. The verb is accented because it stands between its two predicates and thus implicitly serves two clauses.
