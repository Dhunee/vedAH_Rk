The “drink!” sequence is brought to an end with a summary evā́in 3a. The verse continues with a series of 7 choppy imperatival clauses, all but the first (mándatu tvā) with Indra as subj., which balance the choppy nominal relative clauses of vs. 2. The last of these clauses is the third iteration of abhí √tṛd, with which we began.

mándatu tvā in 3a inaugurates a 3-vs. sequence chained together by the root √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate’, a sequence whose 1st vs. (3) overlaps with the last vs. of the initial triad. The other representatives also occur in the 1st pāda: mádāḥ in 4a and mandasānáḥ in 5a. Cf. also matsarā́saḥ in 4d. The conceptual unity of the sequence is underlined by the fact that 5ab is a rel. clause that must hang off the previous vs. The 2nd hemistich of 5 marks a sharp break.

These first three vss. form something of a unity. Each begins with a “drink!” imperative (1a píbā sómam, 2a sá īm pāhi, 3a evā́pāhi), and each contains the lexeme abhí √tṛd ‘drill through to’. As outlined below, it is a pleasingly designed rhetorical structure, whose balance and contrast only become evident after conscious analysis.
