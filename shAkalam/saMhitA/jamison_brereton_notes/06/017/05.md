mándatu tvā in 3a inaugurates a 3-vs. sequence chained together by the root √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate’, a sequence whose 1st vs. (3) overlaps with the last vs. of the initial triad. The other representatives also occur in the 1st pāda: mádāḥ in 4a and mandasānáḥ in 5a. Cf. also matsarā́saḥ in 4d. The conceptual unity of the sequence is underlined by the fact that 5ab is a rel. clause that must hang off the previous vs. The 2nd hemistich of 5 marks a sharp break.
