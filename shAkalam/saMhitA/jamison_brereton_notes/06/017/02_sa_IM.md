Again I think the “drink!” imperative is semi-detached from the rest of the vs., a mere interruption of the sequence of rel. clauses with Indra as subj., which begins with a fully realized clause in 1cd and continues in 2abc with a set of five compressed definitional nominal clauses with an izafe-like feel.

These first three vss. form something of a unity. Each begins with a “drink!” imperative (1a píbā sómam, 2a sá īm pāhi, 3a evā́pāhi), and each contains the lexeme abhí √tṛd ‘drill through to’. As outlined below, it is a pleasingly designed rhetorical structure, whose balance and contrast only become evident after conscious analysis.
