I take nṛvát as an adverb, since this neut. is almost always so used. Geldner and Renou instead take it as a full adj. ‘consisting of men, accompanied by men’ modifying a gapped noun (Besitz, la richesse) and implicitly parallel to bhū́ri … paśváḥ “abundance of livestock.” I am not convinced, and curiously the passage Geldner cites in his n. 10a as support for the interpr. contains a nṛvát that must be adverbial. Still, I do have to admit that a few such expressions do exist outside of the neut. sg.: I.92.7 nrváta ̥ ḥ … vā́jān, IX.93.5 rayím ... nrvántam ̥ .

These two vss. play on the two words purú- ‘many’ and vásu- ‘good’ in this final explosion of begging for a suitable return from the god.
