pṛthvī́here (and in the same phrase in 4c) is of course a blindingly obvious pun: though used as an adj. here (‘broad’) it is of course (almost) identical to the standard word for ‘earth’, found in the dual dvandva dyā́vā-pṛthivī́in the next pāda (also 4a, 5a). By an accident of grammar, the nom./acc. dual fem. (in pṛthvī́, here modifying the dual dvandva) and the nom. singular. fem. pṛthivī́‘earth’ have the same ending -ī́. This grammatical pun is only actualized fully in the final vs. of the hymn, where we get the conjoined singular NP dyaúś ca pṛthivī́ca.

As noted in the published introduction, the focus here is on the various liquids associated with Heaven and Earth and their sheer moisture. Vs. 1 has ghee, honey, milk (by implication, in the compd. madhu-dúghe), and semen; in vs. 2 they are said never to dry up (ásaścantī) and possess streams, milk, ghee, and semen. The cmpd.

madhu-dúgha- ‘milking out honey’ in 1b is reprised by the VP ghṛtáṃ duhāte in 2b (with a diff. obj.). Another responsion is bhúvanānām ‘creatures’ (1a) and (asyá) bhúvanasya ‘(this) creation’ in 2c.
