As indicated in the published introduction, the contents of this vs. and the reason for its inclusion in this hymn are both deeply obscure, though the occurrence of the rare stem agrū́- ‘unwed girl’ in 7a may have prompted the inclusion of the bizarre anecdote in 9ab. As Geldner's reff. for ab show, the shunned son of a maiden, the blind man, and the lame man are mentioned together in II.13.12, 15.7, I.112.8; also IV.30.16, 19. So, however ill-assorted, this is a set. The unfortunate son of an agrū́is also mentioned in nearby IV.30.16, though there he is only shunned, not eaten by ants.

On ukhachíd- see Scarlatta (131).

Unfortunately I have nothing further to say about the sense of this vs. I have toyed with the possibility that there’s a ritual reference here, to the taking out of the offering fire from the householder’s fire and its removal to the east. But, though there might be rough correspondence -- very rough -- between the first and third parts, the middle part with the blind man and the snake doesn't work at all, as far as I can see.

For my interpr. of the speakers in these vss. and the role of the waters in the myth, see published introduction. Most tr. take the vss. as all spoken by Indra’s mother (Geldner [/Witzel Gotō], Doniger), whereas I distribute them to a variety of voices: 6 Indra, 7 Indra’s mother, 8 waters, 9 Indra’s mother. As I see it, in 6 Indra prompts his mother to ask the waters questions; in 7 she rather sarcastically and belittlingly asks questions about them, whom she seems to accuse of trying to lay claim to her son. They respond directly to him in 8, reminding him of his mother’s dereliction of maternal duty and suggesting that they are better at mothering him than she is. So that she rather defiantly points out in 9 that subsequent negative things that happened to him were not her fault.
