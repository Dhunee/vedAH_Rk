Indra gets the last word in this hymn and, having described his situation in the direst of terms, ends with a note of hope and coming triumph: the falcon’s arrival with the soma, to be treated (in even more enigmatic terms) in two nearby hymns, IV.26-27. Since in our hymn the new-born Indra drank soma in Tvaṣṭar’s house (3c) and presumably had a good dose of it before the Vṛtra battle, the falcon’s stolen soma cannot be the primal soma, though it sometimes mythologically seems to parallel the primal stealing of fire in the Prometheus myth.

A dog-cooker (śvapaca-) in later texts is a person living outside of societal norms (cf., e.g., MDŚ III.92), grouped with those who have fallen from caste and so forth.

Notice that Indra here finds no one to be merciful to him (ná … vivide marḍitā́ram), in contrast to the merciful waters when he was a baby (8c).

Most take the dishonored wife to be Indra’s own, but no wife has intruded on the family drama we’ve been observing. I assume rather that this is another reference to his mother, who, now that she is a widow, receives slighting treatment.

IV.19. Indra

See the published introduction. for uncertainties about the interpr. of these vss. In some sense they seem to enlarge on the theme of “Indra’s disgrace” (índrasyāvadyám) in 7b -- the blood guilt Indra incurs from even sanctioned killing, made far worse by the intra-family slaughter depicted in vs. 12. Which leads to Indra’s extreme loss of status, isolation, and shunning by the other gods in the final vs. ### 12
In light of d, which describes Indra’s killing his father, the question in a, “who made your mother a widow,” can only be answered “you did!” The final word of the vs. pādagṛ́hya ‘having grasped him by the foot’ is puzzling. It might seem to exclude Vṛtra as the victim (and as Indra’s father) since, as a snake, he has no feet -- though it might be a way of indicating picking up a snake by its tail. The only other occurrence of this cmpd gerund is in the desperately difficult hymn X.27, vs. 4, where the context is similar and the referent does seem to be Vṛtra.
