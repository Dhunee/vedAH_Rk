Geldner tr. párāhan as a 3rd sg., continuing the 3rd persons of vs. 6, but the rest of vs. 7 has 2nd ps. reference. The verb ahan, ambiguous between 2nd and 3rd sg., serves as a modulation form, as often (cf. I.32.3d, 4a, for ex.).

As noted in the published introduction, these two vss. tease apart the Vala and Vṛtra myths that have been intertwined in the previous vss., with the Vṛtra myth allotted to vs. 7 and the Vala myth to vs. 8. But even with the clear mention of Vṛtra in 7a and Saramā in 8b, there is some ambiguity, centered on the apó beginning 8a. See comm. on vs. 8.
