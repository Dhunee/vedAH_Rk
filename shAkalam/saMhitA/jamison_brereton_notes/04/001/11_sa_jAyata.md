The vs. treats the birth of the ritual fire on earth, with the second hemistich describing the amorphous shape and constant motion of physical fire. That it has neither foot nor head (apā́d aśīrṣā́) presumably refers to the lack of consistent vertical definition of a flickering fire; “concealing its two ends” (guhámāno ántā) is reminiscent of 7c “enveloped within the limitless” (ananté antáḥ párivītaḥ), and the explanations suggested there may apply here. In addition, the “two ends” may be the non-existent foot and head just referred to.

The repeated phrase “in the nest of the bull” (vṛṣabhásya nīḷé, 11d, 12b) is somewhat opaque, but I think Geldner is basically right, that the vṛṣabhá- is Agni (not, with Hoffmann, heaven). His nest is, in my opinion, the ritual ground; its designation also as the “womb of truth” (ṛtásya yóni-, 12b) supports this identification. I find Witzel Gotō’s n. on this phrase incomprehensible, though it seems to follow Hoffmann in part.
