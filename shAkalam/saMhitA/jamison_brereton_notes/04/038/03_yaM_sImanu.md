There is sharp difference of opinion about the sense of medhayú-: is it built to medhā́- ‘wisdom’ or médha- ‘ritual offering, meal’? The former is the choice of Geldner, Renou, Mayr (tentatively, EWA, s.v. medhā́-), while Grassmann, Scarlatta (188), and I opt for ‘meal’. (Witzel Gotō’s rendering “wie ein Opfertier Verlangender” must also reflect this médha- stem.) The ‘meal’ interpr. fits well with gṛ́dhyantam ‘greedy’, and it also makes more sense to me that a horse would want something to eat rather than wisdom. Moreover, if Dadhikrā represents the sacrificial horse in the Aśvamedha, there is a (sinister) echo of the name of this sacrifice: the horse is unwittingly seeking his own sacrifice. It can, of course, also be a pun.
