kṣipaṇí- is yet another hapax. The standard rendering is ‘lash’ (Geldner: Peitschenhieb, Renou: coup-de-fouet), and the published translation simply follows this. Witzel Gotō suggest rather ‘in Beschleunigung’ (acceleration). Acdg. to their n. they take it as an Inhaltsakk., flg. Gaedicke. This is possible, I suppose: ‘rushes a rush’ à ‘rushes a flinging’ (‘flinging’ à ‘acceleration’). But since the similarly formed kṣipaṇú- (IV.58.6) appears to be a physical weapon, a physical object seems likely here.

Moreover, this vs. abruptly confronts us with the harsh constraints imposed on the horse by his rider -- “bound” in three places and whipped to frenzied running. The lash is an important part of this picture. Until now Dadhikrā has been presented as an untrammeled autonomous agent, but now the audience must suddenly reassess who’s the boss, as it were. For the relationship between √kṣip ‘fling, hurl’ and whips, see V.83.3 rathī́va káśayā́śvān abhikṣipán “Like a charioteer lashing out at his horses with a whip.” The two pādas of the 2nd half-vs. are nicely balanced, each ending with an intensive participle preceded by a preposition phrase headed by ánu ‘following’ (in the same metrical position). The two ánu phrases are contrastive, however: in c what is being followed is mental (krátum), in d simply the physical course (pathā́m áṅkāṃsi). Given the horse’s portrayal in the first half of the vs., we must now wonder whose krátu- Dadhikrā is following. For most of this series we would have assumed he follows his own -- he’s been shown as an irresistible force of nature -- but 4ab show him under human control, confined in horse tackle and whipped, so we might instead wonder if it is his rider’s krátu- that he is subject to.

These two vss. revisit the utá sma opening that characterized the middle vss. of IV.38.

There is also a concentration of intensives: 3d táritrataḥ, 4c saṃtā́vīt u vat, 4d āpaniphaṇat -- appropriate to the ever-increasing speed and the intense repetitive movements of the horse racing to the finish line.
