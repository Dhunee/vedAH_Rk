The purport of this verse is something of a puzzle. I think the point is that the journey undertaken by Indra in vs. 4 has finally brought him here, with both his battle-lust and his equipment on full display, in order to drink soma with the ritualists (including the “I” of the speaker). Cf. nearby IV.29.2, where Indra presents himself in a non-intimidating way (or so he thinks) and “becomes exhilarated along with the heroes who have pressed the soma.” Here his arrival is at sunrise, and “I” have a share in the soma along with Indra at that time. In order to make sense of 6c, we need to understand/supply ábhakṣi from 5c (as Geldner [/Witzel Gotō] do also). Although Klein (DGRV II.129) thinks the two ádha’s in c have different functions, the pointed parallel structure of that short pāda -- ádha LOC ádha LOC -- makes that conclusion quite unlikely in its strong form -- though I think it is the case that the formal parallelism conceals a functional distinction (different from the one suggested by Klein). The question is how to construe the locatives, and it is here that the sácā in 5c comes into play. As I noted apropos of that pāda, the sácā there seems just to signal that the loc. sū́rye is a functional loc. absol. In our pāda c there is no sácā, but I think it should be understood. On the one hand, it again (silently) marks sū́rye as a loc. absol.; however, with índre I suggest it has lexical value (as it likely has in the two occurrences of tvé sácā in the next hymn [IV.32.3c, 4a]), indicating that “I” take my share in Indra’s company. What I am suggesting is that a non-overt sácā, supplied on the basis of its occurrence in the previous vs., has two different functions in a single pāda, a pāda whose structure suggests that its parts should be rigidly parallel. This is not sufficiently conveyed by the published translation -- I am not sure that English is up to conveying it -- which I would now emend to “(I have taken my share) now in (company with) you, now in (company with) the sun (i.e., at sunrise).”

All three vss. of this tṛca begin with yátra. I take them all as subordinated to vs. 3. Geldner [/Witzel Gotō] and Klein (DGRV I.432) take the main clause for all three vss. to be 6c, but Indra’s help for Etaśa does not seem sufficiently significant to carry the whole tṛca. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take all three yátra as ‘where’, not ‘when’, but what location they are thinking of I don’t know.

I do not know what to do with the utá’s in yátrotá in 4 and 6, but assume they are there to indicate the additive nature of the sequence of subordinate clauses. Sim.

Klein (DGRV I.431-32). It would be better if the first one were in vs. 5, not vs. 4.
