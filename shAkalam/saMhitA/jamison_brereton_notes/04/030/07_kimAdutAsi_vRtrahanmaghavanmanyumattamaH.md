In c átra seems to correspond to the three yátra’s in the preceding tṛca. The point seems to be that even after all the energy Indra expended in his fight with the sun (and the gods), he still has a lot of manyú- left to apply in the Uṣas incident.

The repetition of ā́tiraḥ here was already noted ad vs. 3. Note the similarity of the pādas: 3c (yád) áhā … ā́tiraḥ / 7c (átr)ā́ha … ā́tiraḥ; though áhā ‘days’ in 3 and the particle áha in 7 are unrelated, the echo is surely deliberate.

I supply “lying there” with Dānu, because in two of the four singular passages containing dā́nu- what the Dānu does is ‘lie’: I.32.9 dā́nuḥ śaye; II.12.11 dā́nuṃ śáyānam. So, although ‘overcame’ is probably part of the semantics of ā́tiraḥ, the lit.

sense ‘pass over’ fits having the prostrate enemy as the object.

My interpr. of the structural relationship of these two vss. and of the internal structure of vs. 8 differs considerably from the standard. Because of the parallelism of the openings of these vss., both with utá smā, I think that there should be two parallel clauses. But vs. 7 is a hí clauses with accented verb (āhúḥ), whereas the only verb in vs. 8 is maṃhase in pāda c. I am also puzzled by the pári in 8a, which is difficult to construe with the rest. There is no pári √maṃh elsewhere, and pári is in any case not situated where we would expect a preverb in tmesis. Witzel Gotō tr.

valiantly “du schenkst … ringsum,” which works in a pinch but I find it unsatisfying.

I suggest instead that pāda a contains an abbreviated form of a common formula containing both pári and sádyaḥ and a verb of motion. Cf. in IV: nearby IV.33.1 pári dyā́ṃ sadyó apáso babhūvuḥ; IV.45.7 yéna sadyáḥ pári rájāṃsi yātháḥ; IV.51.5 pariprayāthá bhúvanāni sadyáḥ. And elsewhere, e.g., I.115.3 pári dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́yanti sadyáḥ; I.123.8 ékaikā krátum pári yanti sadyáḥ; I.128.3 évena sadyáḥ páry eti pā́rthivam; III.58.8 pári dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́yāti sadyáḥ; V.47.4 diváś caranti pári sadyó ántān; VII.5.7 vāyúr ná pā́thaḥ pári pāsi sadyáḥ; VII.75.4 páñca kṣitī́ḥ pári sadyó jigāti. Given the remarkable number of such collocations, I find it difficult to believe that our poet is not evoking this formula. Since much of this hymn concerns Indra’s journey, it would be contextually appropriate. That vs. 9 asserts that no hindrances can obstruct Indra supports the journey theme. Then, by my interpr., pādas bc constitute the main clause for vss. 7-8.
