Witzel Gotō render asnātā́rā as “ohne dass sie untertauchen,” flg. Tichy (Nom.Ag.

107). It seems to me to be pushing the syntax to render a negated agent noun as the equivalent of negative purpose clause (though in her comment Tichy simply says that it’s “gleichzeitig,” presumably with the time of the main verb), though it is also the case that we don’t know much if anything about swimming in ancient India.
