In b I read ā́hā not ā́hā (a change only in the Pp. not the Saṃhitā text), and analyze this sequence as ā́+ áhā, the neut. pl. of ‘day’ (found also in IV.30.3 and 33.6; cf. also viśváhā in 12a below). This is one of only two supposed exx. of the particle ha with long vowel; the other one (V.41.7) also follows ā́and is susceptible to the same analysis. The ā-final version of ha is ghā, which shows Brugmann's Law and velar outcome before original *o, acdg. to Mark Hale. Note that ha only once elsewhere occurs after the preverb ā́(VIII.9.18 ā́hāyám …). (In fact an analysis ā́hā́yám “this one through the days here …” is also possible in VIII.9.18, though I did not so analyze it there.) By contrast ghā is found fairly commonly after ā́(I.30.8, I.48.5, etc.).

“Along the slope of your intentions” (pravátā … krátūnām) means that the journey to our sacrifice is an easy one because it is in accord with Indra’s intentions.

Why this should be like coming by foot (padéva) is not entirely clear: the journey is so easy that it can be undertaken on foot? pleasant pedestrian rambles generally involve taking an easy downward path? Neither of these seems particular applicable to Indra’s travels.

When sácā occurs with a loc., it generally lacks lexical value and simply signals a locative absolute -- as in the common expression suté sácā “when (the soma) is pressed.” I think that is the intention here, in the phrase sū́rye sácā: it is a temporal expression, “when the sun (rises)”; cf. I.135.3 and comm. ad loc. I have here included a lexical tr. “in company with” because I think sácā, with lexical value, needs to be supplied or understood in the next vs., 6c, for which see disc. below.

However, I would now be inclined simply to tr. here “I have taken my share at sun(rise).”

All three vss. of this tṛca begin with yátra. I take them all as subordinated to vs. 3. Geldner [/Witzel Gotō] and Klein (DGRV I.432) take the main clause for all three vss. to be 6c, but Indra’s help for Etaśa does not seem sufficiently significant to carry the whole tṛca. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take all three yátra as ‘where’, not ‘when’, but what location they are thinking of I don’t know.

I do not know what to do with the utá’s in yátrotá in 4 and 6, but assume they are there to indicate the additive nature of the sequence of subordinate clauses. Sim.

Klein (DGRV I.431-32). It would be better if the first one were in vs. 5, not vs. 4.
