In pāda a the word víśve was omitted in the published translation, which should be emended to “Entirely his were all the soma-drinks.” The three initial satrā́(a, b, c) are echoed by dátre beginning d. Although there is some dissension on the root etym. of dátra- (cf., e.g., Oldenberg, who cites Neisser derivation from dáyate ‘apportion’ -- an analysis apparently followed by both Geldner and Witzel Gotō, judging from their tr. ‘Anteil’), the correct analysis was already sketched by Grassmann s.v.: it is a -tra- deriv. built to the weak stem of the redupl. pres. to √dā ‘give’ (dad-), hence *dáttra, with simplification of the geminate before r, as often. See AiG II.2.703 and the important (if lapidary) correction in the Nachtr. to AiG I: Nachtr. p.

3, to I.5 ll. 30-31.

I take the idiom found in 6d and 7b, LOC. ACC. adhithāḥ, as meaning ‘put s.o. in the path/way of s.th. The middle voice of adhithāḥ signals that the entity in the loc. belongs to the subject, namely Indra -- in the first case his generosity (just celebrated in 5d), in the second his power of attack. Although Geldner recognizes the similarity of these constructions, with identical subjects and objects (see his n. 6d), he renders them quite differently. For áme √dhā in 7b, see also I.63.1, 67.3.
