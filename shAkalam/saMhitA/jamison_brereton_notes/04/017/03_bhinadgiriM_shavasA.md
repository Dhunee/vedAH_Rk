Almost the full panoply of power terms is on display in the first hemistich: śávas-, sáhas- (in the pseudo-part., on which see comm. ad IV.3.6), and ójas-.

The “bull” of the waters is of course Vṛtra.

Hoffmann (Injunk. 178-180) treats these four vss. They express the cosmic disruptions attendant on Indra’s birth and the further disruptions caused by his smashing of Vṛtra. On the ring composition that demarcates this section, see comm. on vs. 4 below.

saráyanta ā́paḥ (sarayánte out of sandhi) in 2d is reprised by sárann ā́paḥ in 3d. The two verbs seem semantically identical; the intransitive -áya-formation takes the post-(late-)caesura position also favored by metrically identical janáyanta.

Its medial ending is an example of -anta replacement of the usual type (cf. Jamison 1979: IIJ 21), though somewhat complicated by the fact that the form out of sandhi is actually primary -ante.
