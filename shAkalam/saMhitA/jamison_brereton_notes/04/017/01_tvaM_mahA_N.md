The pair “earth / heaven” occupy the final slots of the first two pādas: … kṣā́(ḥ)# … dyaúḥ#, with a shared 3rd singular verb ánu … manyata. Note that there also exists a dual dvandva containing these stems: dyā́vā-kṣā́mā. The 2nd hemistich contains two pf. participles expressing action anterior to the main verb (sṛjáḥ): jaghanvā́n ‘having smashed’ and jagrasānā́n ‘having been swallowed’.
