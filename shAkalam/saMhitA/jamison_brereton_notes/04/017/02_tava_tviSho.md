As in vs. 1, the pair heaven and earth are expressed by two singulars (dyaúḥ, bhū́miḥ), even though, again, there is a dual dvandva available: dyā́vā-bhū́mī.

BR suggest reading dyaúr éjad for Pp. dyaúḥ / réjat. Although rejected by Oldenberg, this reading (which does not require changing the Saṃhitā text) is accepted by Geldner, Hoffmann (Injunk. 179, 181), and Gotō (1st class, 271-72), as well as by me. The stem réja- is almost entirely medial (see rejata in pāda a), while éja- is act. It is easy to see how the misparsing could have arisen, due to the presence of immediately preceding rejata.

With Geldner, I take tviṣáḥ as a gen. dependent on bhiyásā in b, thus parallel to manyóḥ. It would also be possible to take tviṣáḥ as an abl. of cause (so Hoffmann 179, Witzel Gotō).

Note the phonetic figure táva tviṣáḥ. Note also that the reflex. adj. svásya must reference táva and therefore have 2nd ps. value (as well as not referring to the grammatical subj., as is sometimes claimed for reflexives).

Hoffmann (Injunk. 178-180) treats these four vss. They express the cosmic disruptions attendant on Indra’s birth and the further disruptions caused by his smashing of Vṛtra. On the ring composition that demarcates this section, see comm. on vs. 4 below.

saráyanta ā́paḥ (sarayánte out of sandhi) in 2d is reprised by sárann ā́paḥ in 3d. The two verbs seem semantically identical; the intransitive -áya-formation takes the post-(late-)caesura position also favored by metrically identical janáyanta.

Its medial ending is an example of -anta replacement of the usual type (cf. Jamison 1979: IIJ 21), though somewhat complicated by the fact that the form out of sandhi is actually primary -ante.
