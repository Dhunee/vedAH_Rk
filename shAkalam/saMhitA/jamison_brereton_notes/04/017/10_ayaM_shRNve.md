The sense of ádha here is somewhat unclear and its position anomalous, as it is generally, though not invariably, clause-initial. Klein (DGRM II.97) notes its medial position but considers it to have the usual sense he assigns to ádha, namely ‘therefore’. This passage is reminiscent of VII.34.2 śṛṇvánty ā́po ádha kṣárantīḥ, where ádha likewise appears mid-clause and before a pres. participle (as well as after a form of √śru, though act., not pass. as here). My sense is that ádha in both passages introduces a participial addition that clarifies or modifies the sense of the main verb, hence a sort of mini-clause.

In pāda b the lexeme prá kṛṇute with its middle voice in my opinion encodes a complex thought: in battle Indra brings the (enemies’) cows forward in such a way as to make them his own, that is, to capture them. Med. kṛṇuté recurs in the next pāda, where its object is Indra’s own battle-fury (manyúm).

This sequence of vss. is marked by initial ayám ‘this one here’ (9a, 9c, 10a, 10b; cf. also asyá 9d). This near-deictic pronoun may indicate that Indra is currently present at the sacrifice. These vss. are also marked by present tense verbs describing Indra’s characteristic and habitual activities -- in contrast to vs. 11, which opens with an imperfect (sám … ajayat).
