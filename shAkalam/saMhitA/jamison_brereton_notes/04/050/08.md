These vss. are structured similarly: a main clause (or clauses) referring to the happy results for the king who (now a rel. cl.) properly treats a particular figure.

The figure in vs. 6 is Bṛhaspati; filling the same slot in vs. 7 is the brahmán- ‘formulator’. We have thus moved from the divine to the human realm, and the identity of Bṛhaspati and brahmán- is signaled by their parallel roles in the vs. structure.
