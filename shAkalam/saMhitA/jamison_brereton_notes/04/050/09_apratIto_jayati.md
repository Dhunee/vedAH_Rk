The shift from divine to human just noted above in vss. 7-8 comes full circle in this vs. The human Formulator is, it seems, in need of aid from the king (avasyáve … brahmáṇe), but if the king provides this aid he himself receives aid from the gods (tám avanti devā́ḥ).

This last section consisting of two vss. introduces Indra by name for the first time in the hymn. The two divine figures are carefully balanced, as the address to them shows: vs. 10 opens with the name Indra in a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction, índraś ca … bṛhaspate, while two independent vocatives open vs. 11, this time with Bṛhaspati first: bṛhaspata indra.
