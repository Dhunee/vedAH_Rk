As indicated in the published introduction, this is the final vs. of the 1st section of the hymn and has the standard marks of a hymn-final summary vs. It is the best evidence that vss. 1-6 were a separate composition, only secondarily amalgamated with the following two sections. Nonetheless, I think it simply marks a pause and a transition to the thematically contrastive next section.

As indicated in the published introduction, this section concerns the unitary figure (Indra-)Bṛhaspati, here insistently identified as Bṛhaspati: there are 7 occurrences of the name in 6 vss., one in each save for two in vs. 2.
