My interpr. depends on reading (as sometimes elsewhere) yádi (‘if’) as yád

*ī (‘when it’), despite the short i before a single consonant. It is possible that yád *ī
was changed redactionally, to match yádi in IV.27.3. A heavy syllable in fourth place in an opening of four is standard (see Arnold 182, 188), and in particular the sequence of four shorts in #(bhárad) yádi | vír á(to) seems quite unusual, while a long vowel before the caesura and preceding a break of two shorts is metrically more favorable -- though given the many metrical departures in this hymn (see, e.g., the next vs.), this is not a strong argument.

The 3rd sg. act. impf./injunc. of √bhṛ is the “hero” of this, the mythological portion, of the hymn: bhárat (4d, 5a), bharat (6c), abharat (7a).
