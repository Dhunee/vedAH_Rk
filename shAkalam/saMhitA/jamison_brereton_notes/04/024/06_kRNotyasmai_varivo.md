The “wide space” theme returns from 2d. The laconic expression of the recipient of wide space in 2d (the dat. súṣvaye ‘for the presser’) is expanded into a dat. pronoun with rel. clause attached: asmai … yá itthéndrāya sómam uśaté sunóti.

Since the first part of this hymn ends with vs. 7, vss. 2 and 6 are symmetrical and this echo forms a small internal ring. But there are no other signs of ring composition.

The tradition (as well as modern ed. and tr.) is split on whether to read ávivenam (Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition, Müller ed., Sāyaṇa., Lubotsky, and AiG I.1.333) or ávivenan (Auf. ed., Pp, Grassmann, Ol, and Geldner); see Oldenberg’s disc.

Quite apart from the actual form is its referent. Oldenberg, who accepts the ávivenan reading, takes c with d and identifies Indra as the referent of ávivenan. Although this fits better with the similar expression in the next hymn (IV.25.3) where gods are (or may be) the subject, here I think Geldner is correct that c belongs grammatically with the rel. cl. in ab, and the referent of ávivenan is the soma-presser subject of that rel. cl.

This nominative is resumed by the appropriate correlative prn. tám in the acc. in d.

The battle/sacrifice trajectory of vss. 4-5 is wrapped up in vss. 6-7, where it is made clear (esp. in 6d) that if you want Indra’s help on the battlefield, you had better perform a good sacrifice, not stinting on the soma.
