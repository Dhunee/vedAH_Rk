The b pāda contains one of the RV’s beloved gender-bending paradoxes, with the cows coming out “from the udder of a bull” (vṛ́ṣṇa ū́dhnaḥ). Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) interprets this as rainwater coming from the sky (Parjanya or Heaven). I think it more likely that it concerns the Vala myth. Indra’s other signature deed, the slaying of Vṛtra, was treated in the immediately preceding, paired verse (5d), and so we might expect mention of his other most prominent feat. In that case the “bull” would be the Vala cave. On the other hand, this might continue the treatment of the Vṛtra myth in 5d (as Geldner also suggests, n. 6b), in which case the “bull” would be Vṛtra himself or the mountain in which the waters were confined. The more thorough treatment of the waters in the Vṛtra myth in the following vs. 7 might support this latter view.

These vss. summarizing Indra’s great deeds begin identically: tā́tū́te [ta in sandhi before vowel in 6]. The vss. appear at the exact center of the hymn and thus may count as an omphalos. Although both pādas have Indra’s deeds as subject, neither has a word for ‘deed’.

Another responsion: 6c ádhā ha / 7a átrā́ha. Later in the pāda 7a tā́u recalls the openings of 5a and 6a tā́tū́.
