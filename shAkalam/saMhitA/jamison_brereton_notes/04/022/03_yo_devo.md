In the published translation I take the whole vs. as a single sentence, with ab a relative clause to the main cl. in cd. Geldner (Hoffmann/Witzel Gotō) take b as the main clause to the rel.

cl. in a and take cd separately. This is entirely possible; there is no grammatical marking to determine the structure, since b lacks a finite verb. Since b is a repeated pāda (VI.32.4b), it might indeed be better to take it as an independent unit and follow the Geldner interpr.

The distraction of #dyā́m ... bhū́ma# in d is paralleled by 4b #dyaúr ... kṣā́ḥ#.
