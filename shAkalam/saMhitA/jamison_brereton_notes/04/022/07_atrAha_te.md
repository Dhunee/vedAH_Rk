Most tr. take stavanta as passive, and this seems the correct interpr. The sisters are likely the rivers or waters released after the killing of Vṛtra. The question is why they would be praised as well as Indra. Geldner’s suggestion (n. 7ab) is that it is essentially a spill-over effect (not that he uses that term), that Indra’s praiseworthy deed that brought the waters release also brought them praise by association.

I don’t understand the double ánu (pādas c and d), though my surmise is that the first one simply anticipates the second, which is in a semi-fixed expression dīrghā́m ánu prásitim (cf. X.40.10). Grassmann takes it as part of a preverb complex with √muc: ánu prá √muc ‘nacheinander loslassen’, and its position might support that assumption. But surely one of points in the Vṛtra myth is that the rivers burst out dramatically all at once. Geldner, by contrast, compares the identical sequence yát sīm ánu in I.37.9, I.141.9, but those two passages seem unconnected with ours, with the ánu construed with preceding sīm “following them.” (One can also compare IV.38.3 yáṃ sīm ánu, but this has yet a different sense.)

Another responsion: 6c ádhā ha / 7a átrā́ha. Later in the pāda 7a tā́u recalls the openings of 5a and 6a tā́tū́.
