This vs., particularly the first pāda, has been subjected to a variety of interpretations, which I will not pursue in detail here. The vs. is reminiscent of, though far less difficult than, IV.5.7, and in both cases I think it concerns the ritual and the layout of the ritual ground. The loc. phrase sasásya … víyutā “at the separation of the grain” I take as a reference to the spreading of the barhis, the ritual grass; it seems to correspond to the loc. phrase in IV.5.7c sasásya cárman “on the hide of the grain.” See also V.21.4, where Agni is urged to sit “on the womb of grain” (sasásya yónim). “At the same udder” (sásminn ū́dhan) is also found in nearby IV.10.8, also with apparent reference to the sacrifice or the ritual ground.

On 3rd sg. veḥ (√vī) in 7d, see comm. ad II.5.3. Here the form serves as a pivot, veḥ in 8a having the more morphologically orthodox 2nd ps. reference. The near identity of the two adjacent phrases, 7d #vér adhvarā́ya and 8a #vér adhvarásya (dūtyā̀ni), requires us to consider them together. The first is clearly 3rd sg. (with nom. agníḥ in the preceding pāda, nom. ṛtā́vā in the same pāda). The 2nd ps. ref. of the second only emerges in pāda 8c, with 2nd sg. verb īyase. The poet seems to want first to enforce the 3rd ps. reference of the verb (even in 8ab the nom. pf. participles vidvā́n and cikitvā́n appear to continue the 3rd ps.) and then require us to construct a paradigm: 2nd sg. vés [sandhi vér], 3rd sg. vés [sandhi vér], like 2nd sg. (ā́)var, 3rd sg.

(ā́)var, which I invoked ad II.5.3 to explain the anomalous 3rd sg. vés. We can see this sequence as a variant on poetic repair.

The near repetition of the VP in 8a also clarifies the construction of the verb in 7d, with gapped object. I take dat. adhvarā́ya (7d) and gen. adhvarásya (8a) as filling essentially the same functional role.

Though vs. 6 belongs metrically and syntactically with what precedes -- it is in Anuṣṭubh like vss. 2-5 and the accusative descriptive phrases hang off vs. 5 -- it belongs thematically with vs. 7, as noted in the published introduction. Both vss. treat the mystery of the ritual fire, and being at the center of the hymn, they form a sort of omphalos.
