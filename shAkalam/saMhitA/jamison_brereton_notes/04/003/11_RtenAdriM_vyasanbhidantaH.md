The third truth-formulation vs. sets up the Vala myth as the model for the coming of dawn: just as the Aṅgirases breached the Vala cave and let loose the cows, so the human sacrificers break Dawn out of her confinement by kindling the ritual fire. This is the third step in the depiction of the morning ritual. As noted elsewhere (see esp. the published introduction to Maṇḍala IV and to IV.1), the Vala myth and the Aṅgirases play an outsize role in the Agni cycle of IV.

Despite the injunctives of pāda a (vy àsan) and c (pári ṣadan), I am tempted, with Grassmann, to read anavanta in b, to produce 11 syllables. (Consider the augmented impf. in d, abhavat.) Oldenberg (Noten) considers this restoration possible but not necessary. Hoffmann (Injunk., 209) gives a typical treatment of the vs. in his interpretational system, assuming an injunc. navanta in b.

Each of these vss. begins with the resonant and charged instr. ṛténa ‘by truth’, the usual introduction to a truth formulation. Each of the vss. does seem to express a mystical truth about the ritual or its mythic background. There is no obvious connection to the group of vss. that precede (the question vss. of 4cd-8), but if I am correct that we should supply ‘thought’ or ‘thoughts’ in 8cd, where we ask Agni to send them all the way to heaven, it may not be fanciful to think that vss. 9-12 are these very thoughts.
