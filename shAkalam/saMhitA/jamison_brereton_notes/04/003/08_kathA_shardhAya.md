Although it is tempting to take ṛtā́ya as an adj. modifying śárdhāya (so, e.g., Geldner “der rechtwandelnden Schar,” sim. Witzel Gotō, Oldenberg SBE), the stem ṛtá- is overwhelmingly a neut. noun. It is possible, with Renou, to take it as an appositive with the Marut troop: “Ordre (incarné)” or, with Lüders (623), as a separate entity to whom Agni’s speech is directed, but I think it more likely that it is a dative of purpose, like (ya)kṣé in 6d, havirdé in 7b: “for truth,” that is, for the Maruts to attain or ascertain the truth.

The masc. (/neut.) turā́ya cannot modify fem. áditaye (pace Oldenberg SBE). Geldner supplies “heaven”; Witzel Gotō suggest the sun. With Renou I opt tentatively for Indra, who is frequently modified by this adj. and who is otherwise absent from this fairly comprehensive list of important gods (see Geldner n. 8c). Brereton (Ādityas, 205-6) instead thinks turā́ya represents an Āditya, probably Varuṇa, and takes áditaye not as the name of the goddess but as a common noun ‘innocence’, with the dative phrase meaning “for the mighty one (=Varuṇa) to (ascertain our) innocence.” This assertion of innocence at the end of a series of questions about potential blame would set the stage for the request that Agni make our sacrifice succeed (pāda d). This suggestion is appealing, but I am not convinced that áditi- ever means ‘innocence’, and further in this sequence the purpose datives are only pāda-final, which áditaye is not.

Pāda d poses some syntactic challenges. The first is that sā́dhā, by all accounts a 2nd sg. act. impv. to √sādh, has no expressed obj., though act. forms of this root are fundamentally tr. (but sometimes, esp. in the participle, used in absolute sense “assuring success”; cf. nearby IV.1.9). I supply dhíyam ‘thought’ vel sim. as the object, since forms of dhī́- or other words for thought/prayer are regularly construed with √sādh. The other problem is what to construe gen./abl. diváḥ with. (It cannot be acc. pl. because of the accent.) The standard solution has been to take it with cikitvā́n (e.g., Geldner “der du den Himmel kennst”), but as Renou points out, cikitvā́n is never otherwise construed with a gen. His solution is to supply an obj. for sā́dhā on which diváḥ is dependent: “Mène droit au but (les affaires) du ciel.” My interpr.

requires a slight emendation, from sā́dhā diváḥ to *sā́dhā́diváḥ -- that is, sā́dha ā́ diváḥ, with ā́+ ABL in the meaning “all the way to.” Cf. I.92.17 yaú … ślókam ā́ diváḥ … cakráthuḥ “you two who made your signal-call (reach) all the way to heaven”; sim. III.61.4. See comm. ad locc. An asterisk should be inserted before “all the way.”

The list of gods to whom Agni will tattle on us follows a certain pattern.

Vs. 5 contains the standard great trio of Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, as well as a minor Āditya, Bhaga ‘Fortune’, who is, however, important for our welfare.

Although we might have expected the Sun here, because he serves as the Ādityas’ eye, observing our offenses, we have instead Heaven and Earth, which frame the cosmos. In vs. 6 the nearer gods of the midspace, particularly Vāta ‘wind’ and the Aśvins, are featured. Rudra appears in both 6 and 7; I don’t quite understand why, but recall first that Agni was identified as Rudra in vs. 1 and may be also in 10d (see also 14b). Moreover, in 6 the punishing aspect of Rudra is emphasized (‘mansmiting’, nṛhán-), while in 7 he is paired and/or contrasted with the benevolent Pūṣan under the ambiguous epithet súmakha-, which means both ‘good combatant’ and ‘very generous’, so his effects on human life are emphasized and he counts as a nearer god, who in fact is the giver of the oblation (havirdā́-). In the 2nd half of 7 Viṣṇu and his three strides return us to the contemplation of the whole cosmos, and vs. 8 functions ring-compositionally with vs. 5: we have the Sun we expected (and didn’t get) in 5, with Aditi standing in for the Ādityas in 5, and heaven (though probably the place, not the deity) is the final goal.
