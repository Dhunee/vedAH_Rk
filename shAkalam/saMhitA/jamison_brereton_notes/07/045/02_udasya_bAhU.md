Both Geldner and Renou take the aor. injunc. paniṣṭa in c as modal, but the aor.

injunc. ánu dāt in d as general pres. (e.g., “Jetzt sei … gepriesen; … ordnet …”). But there is no reason that the first needs to be assigned modal value: the temporal adv.

nūnám can instead draw attention to an immediate past action (“has [just] been wondered at”). And it seems preferable, if contextually possible, to take the two adjacent aor. injunctives in the same value.

Although Savitar’s role as god of evening, causing the world and its activities to settle down, is alluded to in 1d, his role as rouser of the world at dawn is given equal billing in that pāda (… ca … ca). The more oblique expression in 2d must also refer to this latter role. The sun “cedes his task” of waking and rousing the world to Savitar.
