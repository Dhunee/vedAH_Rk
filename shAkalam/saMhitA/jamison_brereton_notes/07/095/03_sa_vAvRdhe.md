The male subject of this vs. is not identified, but the Anukramaṇī identifies him as Sarasvant. This seems correct (despite doubts raised, e.g., by Oldenberg), given that half of the following hymn, the 2nd tṛca (VII.96.4-6), is devoted to him and he is mentioned by name in all three vss. The two hymns VII.95 and 96, despite being in different meter, should be read against each other. See comm. ad vs. 1 above.

I take med. māmṛjīta as reflexive, with Sarasvant both subj. and obj. (so also, apparently, Kümmel 373), though Geldner thinks that the obj. is the racehorse and Renou that both subj. and obj. are the racehorse.
