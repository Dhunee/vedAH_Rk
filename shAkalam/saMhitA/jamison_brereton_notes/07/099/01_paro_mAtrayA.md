Renou supplies “other gods” as the subj. of ánv aśnuvanti in b. This seems perfectly acceptable, though not strictly necessary. And since in vs. 2 it is, presumably, mortals (since they are ‘born’) who fail to reach the limit of Viṣṇu’s greatness, mortals could also be the subject here. See remarks below on the formulatic connection between the two vss.

As Renou points out, both the case of the complement (acc. versus gen.) and the voice (act. versus mid.) differ between 1st pl. vidma in c and 2nd sg. vitse in d. The middle voice of vitse makes sense, since Viṣṇu knows his own farthest realm; the variation in case is harder to account for. Perhaps the two earthly realms are subjects of direct knowledge, while the farthest realm is something even Viṣṇu only knows of.

The b-pādas of these two vss. are variants of each other, using two different roots for ‘attain’ (√naś, √āp) and two different formulations of ‘greatness’, the 2nd an elaboration on the first: 1b ná te mahitvám ánv aśnuvanti 2ab ná te … mahimnáḥ páram ántam āpa Another example of the freedom of RVic formulaics; see comm. ad VII.98.5 in the previous hymn for further on this.
