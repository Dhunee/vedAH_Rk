As noted in the introductory remarks above, both pínvanta and máṃsante are accented because they open 5-syl. pādas.

Both Geldner and Renou take the (soma) sacrifice as the referent of asmai, contra both Sāyaṇa. and Oldenberg, who supply Indra instead. I definitely side with the latter. Like many All God hymns, the separate vss. can serve as little riddles, each pointing to a different god,, and the mention of vṛtréṣu ‘(battles against) obstacles’, even in the plural, seems a tip-off that Indra is lurking.

I’m not quite sure what the subjunctive máṃsante is meant to convey -- perhaps that in times to come poets will talk about them that way in the accounts of the Vṛtra-slaying?
