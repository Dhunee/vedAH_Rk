The hapax ádyu- has been variously analyzed and rendered: e.g., Sāyaṇa. adīpti- ‘non-shining’, reflected in Gr’s ‘glanzlos’ and probably Renou’s ‘sans éclat’; Oldenberg ‘excluded from heaven’. But Geldner’s (n. 12b) comparison of Oldenberg Avestan aidiiu- (YH 2x, plus a YA rep.) ‘harmless’ is surely correct and is accepted by EWA, etc. For disc., with earlier lit., see Narten, YH 280-81.

Our half-verse ádyuṃ kṛṇota śáṃsaṃ ninitsóḥ is nearly identical to VII.25.2c āré táṃ śáṃsaṃ kṛṇuhi ninitsóḥ, though in a different meter (our two 5-syl. pādas of Dvipadā versus Triṣṭubh). To accommodate the meter the verb and object had to be flipped and a different predicate supplied. This metrically driven modification procedure is instructive.
