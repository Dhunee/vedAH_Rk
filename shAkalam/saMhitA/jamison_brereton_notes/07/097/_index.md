Indra and Bṛhaspati Renou treats this hymn in EVP XV.66-69. For the structure of the hymn and the covert identification of Bṛhaspati (/Indra) with Agni, see published introduction. This identification is argued for extensively by Schmidt (Bṛhaspati und Indra, 62-67, which also contains a complete tr. and philological comm.).
