The first hemistich contains two occurrences of pári, but in fact it should technically have three: the first pári at the end of pāda a governs the preceding abl.

divás in the sense of ‘from’ (note the close sandhi divás pári); the second, in the middle of b, should be construed with both preceding cárati and following vṛṇaktu and is positioned exactly between the two clauses that contain those two verbs.

I take the hapax voc. svapivāta to the lexeme ápi √vat, which I interpr. after the manner of Tichy. See comm. ad I.128.2. The intimacy implied by this lexeme (‘be/make familiar/intimate’) is appropriate to the focus on the household disc. above.

My tr. “o you who are our familiar” does not represent the su-, but it is difficult to incorporate it without making an already heavy tr. even more so.

The final pādas of both vss. are semantic variants of each other: “don’t hurt our children.” In 2d the negative is expressed by the privative on the adj.

anamīváḥ (… bhava) “be without affliction,” while 3d contains the stronger and more conventional prohibitive mā́… rīriṣaḥ “do not harm.” The word for ‘children’ is the fairly rare uncompounded root noun jā́- in 2d, replaced by the fuller and more familiar bipartite phrase toká- tánaya- “offspring (and) descendents.”
