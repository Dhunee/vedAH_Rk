The complementary etymological and morphological figure ávann ávantīḥ is noteworthy, but I have no idea what “helping/helpful doors”(ávantīr dúraḥ) are or do. Perhaps it is an indirect way to refer to the sacrificial offerings humans make to help the gods, in return for the help (etc.) they receive from the gods, in this case Rudra. As Renou suggests ad loc. (EVP XV.161), “dúraḥ … s’oriente vers «maison»” and the emphasis in this vs. and the next on the protection of our children and offspring may have invited this allusion to the house.

devayántaḥ in 1ab with 3rd ps. referent (see the 3rd pl. verb ákṛṇvata) modulates to 1st ps. reference in 2b, also signalled by the verb (aśyāma).

The final pādas of both vss. are semantic variants of each other: “don’t hurt our children.” In 2d the negative is expressed by the privative on the adj.

anamīváḥ (… bhava) “be without affliction,” while 3d contains the stronger and more conventional prohibitive mā́… rīriṣaḥ “do not harm.” The word for ‘children’ is the fairly rare uncompounded root noun jā́- in 2d, replaced by the fuller and more familiar bipartite phrase toká- tánaya- “offspring (and) descendents.”
