With Gr, Geldner (etc.) I take gāyiṣe as a 1st sg. -se form of the stuṣé type; Oldenberg, fld by Renou, takes it as a 3d sg. passive. Besides separating the form from the standard usage of stuṣé and the like, this leaves bṛhát … vácaḥ syntactically untethered. Oldenberg takes it in instr. sense, but it’s hard to get the neut. acc. to function that way.

Renou also takes mahayā in c as a 1st sg. subjunctive, but an impv. works better with the voc. vasiṣṭha (d), an example of poetic self-address (treated in my 2005 Fs.

Skjaevø article).
