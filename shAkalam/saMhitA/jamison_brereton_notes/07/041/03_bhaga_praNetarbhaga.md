Although the prātár of vs. 1 and 2a has disappeared, this vs. seems to contain a reminiscence of it: 1c #prātár bhágam is echoed by 3a #bhága prá(ṇe)tar (in opposite order), and pādas c and d then pick up prá ṇ(etar) of 3a in #bhága prá ṇo and #bhága prá nṛ́bhiḥ (latter without retroflexion). This is hardly the most sophisticated effect in Rigvedic poetry, but it is an illustration of the subtle concatenative effects that can provide unity and a throughline in even the most banal (as this hymn mostly is) composition.

The concatenation continues in the next vss. The ending of vs. 3, … nṛvántaḥ syāma, echoes in the following two vss. The 1st pl. opt. syāma is repeated at the end of 4a and d and 5b, while the -vant-stem adj. shifts from nṛvántaḥ (3d) to another punning bhágavantaḥ (both ‘possessing a portion’ and ‘accompanied by Bhaga’) in bhágavantaḥ syāma (4a, 5b; cf. bhágavān 5a). And bhágavān in 5a matches maghavan in the same metrical position in 4c.
