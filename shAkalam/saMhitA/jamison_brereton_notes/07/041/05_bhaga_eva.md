The punning continues here with a clever twist: even Bhaga himself should become possessed of a portion (bhágavant-) (a); (only) in this way (téna) will we become bhágavant- (b). In other words, Bhaga needs to get his own portion before he can pass it on to us.

This vs. forms a slight ring with vs. 1: the intensive verb johavīti provides one additional stem to the two forms of √hū in vs. 1, havāmahe and huvema.

The concatenation continues in the next vss. The ending of vs. 3, … nṛvántaḥ syāma, echoes in the following two vss. The 1st pl. opt. syāma is repeated at the end of 4a and d and 5b, while the -vant-stem adj. shifts from nṛvántaḥ (3d) to another punning bhágavantaḥ (both ‘possessing a portion’ and ‘accompanied by Bhaga’) in bhágavantaḥ syāma (4a, 5b; cf. bhágavān 5a). And bhágavān in 5a matches maghavan in the same metrical position in 4c.
