bhavítra- is found only here in the RV. My “(the means of) Creation” gives full functional value to the instrument suffix -tra-. Grassmann “die Welt,” Geldner “Creatur (?),” Renou “le séjour-des-existences”; see Renou’s n. for further, though inconclusive, disc. The immed. preceding hymn contains janítra- (VII.34.2), which seems to mean something similar, insofar as it’s possible to tell.
