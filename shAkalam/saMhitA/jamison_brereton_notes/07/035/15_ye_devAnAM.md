The just discussed phrase in 14d yé yajñíyāsaḥ is picked up by 15a yé devā́nāṃ yajñíyā yajñíyānām. I assume that this phrase doesn’t introduce another group of worthies, but is simply an intensive elaboration of the original phrase. The next pāda qualifies them with another derivative of √yaj, the -tra-stem yájatra-, which I interpr., somewhat capaciously, as meaning that they provide the occasion or reason for Manu’s sacrifice.

These last two vss. stand apart from the 13 monotonous vss. that precede them, though they hardly have more content.
