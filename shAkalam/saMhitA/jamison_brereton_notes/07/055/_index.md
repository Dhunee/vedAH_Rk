Sleep As noted in the published introduction, the first vs. does not belong with the rest of the hymn but rather with the preceding one, VII.54, to Vāstoṣpati, the Lord of the Dwelling Place. However, as also noted there, this is not just a product of wrong division of hymns: VII.55.1 is in a different meter from VII.54, and VII.54 ends with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, which is always the final pāda of a hymn. Moreover, as Oldenberg points out, VII.54 has three vss. and follows correctly on the three-vs. hymns VII.51- 53, while an additional vs. would break that sequence. Oldenberg suggests that the single vs. ### 01
originally formed its own hymn and that the rest of VII.55, with 7 vss., is an addition to the original collection (Anhangslied).
