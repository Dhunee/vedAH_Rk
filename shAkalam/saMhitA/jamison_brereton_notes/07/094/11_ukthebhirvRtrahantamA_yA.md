This vs. is likewise a fragment, a nom. dual dvandva (vṛtrahántamā), which supports a rel. clause characterizing Indra and Agni, but no main clause. By my interpr. (and those of Geldner and Renou), this rel. cl. is nominal, with a predicated part.

mandānā́. Oldenberg takes the ambig. āvívasataḥ as a dual finite verb (but cannily doesn’t tr.); this interpr. requires an anomalous meaning for the form, whereas the interpr. as a gen. sg. participle, shared by Geldner, Renou, and me, allows the form to have its usual sense (“seek to win [the gods]”).
