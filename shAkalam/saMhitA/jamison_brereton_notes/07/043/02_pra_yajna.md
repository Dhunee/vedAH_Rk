In c I construe dat. adhvarā́ya with sādhú, giving the latter richer semantics than the mere adverbial “richtig” of Geldner or even Renou’s “correctement.” Found twice in 42 (1d, 5a), adhvará- reappears here, though the word is too common to make much of this.

As noted above ad 42.3, our pāda d seems to be a clearer expression of the image of the increasing flames of the ritual fire found also in 42.3b.

The 1st two vss. of this hymn begin with prá, recalling the insistent prá in the 1st vs. of the preceding hymn (VII.42.1) and presumably fulfilling the same function: to express the energetic initiation of the ritual. However, both prá √ṛc (1a) and prá √i (2a) are standard lexemes, unlike those in 42.1.
