Flg. a suggestion by Geldner (n. 3a, though not reflected in his tr.), I take eṣáin pāda a (also 4a) as belonging to the stem eṣá- ‘quick’, which is used several times of Viṣṇu in the gen. expression víṣṇor eṣásya (II.34.11, VII.40.5, VIII.20.3), in which confusion with the nom. pronominal eṣá(ḥ) (possible here) is excluded.

The hapax śatárcas- is problematic. The Pp analyses the 2nd member as arcasam, but Wackernagel (AiG I.318) points out that the sandhi between the cmpd members would require rather -ṛcasam. However, Oldenberg disputes this, claiming that it would then have to be written (“… geschrieben werden müssen”) *śatáṛcasam , though it’s not clear to me why. Interpr. differ significantly: Sāyaṇa. glosses with arcis-.

Oldenberg posits a masc. s-stem *arcás- ‘singer’, comparing VI.34.3 yádi stotā́raḥ śatáṃ yát sahásraṃ gṛṇánti “When a hundred, when a thousand praisers sing to him …,” an interpr. followed by Geldner -- though the connection between the two passages seems tenuous to me. By contrast, Renou tr. “au cent éclats,” perhaps flg. Sāyaṇa.’s arcís-. Since an infinitival dat. ṛcáse ‘to praise, for chanting (praise)’ is found in VI.39.5 and VII.61.6, it seems reasonable to take the underlying stem ṛcas- as the base here, as Grassmann does, glossing ‘hundertfach zu preisen’. My ‘worth a hundred verses’ is close to that, though perhaps ‘praises, chants’ would be better.

Because of the lack of accent on asya, it should be pronominal, not adjectival; I would adjust the tr. to “of him, the stalwart.”

As noted in the published introduction, vss. 3 and 4 are responsive. The first pāda of 4 concentrates the essence of the 1st two pādas of 3, substituting ví cakrame (of 3b) for trír deváḥ (in 3a) at the beginning of the pāda. This phrase, trír deváḥ, is short a syllable; Oldenberg suggests reading t·rir, but this seems unlikely: I don’t know of any other disyllabic readings of this extremely common numeral (either as 1st cmpd member tri- or adverbial trís). I suggest rather that the metrically disturbed opening draws attention to the beginning of this set of paired vss. by being flawed and is “repaired” by 4a. See similar remarks about 3c and 5c ad vs. 5.
