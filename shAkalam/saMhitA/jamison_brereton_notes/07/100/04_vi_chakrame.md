By concentrating Viṣṇu’s strides in the first pāda of 4, the poet is free to express the aim of Viṣṇu’s action -- creating space and dwelling places for the people

-- in the rest of the vs. As Geldner points out (n. 4c), asya can refer either to Viṣṇu or to Manu, although in actuality this may not matter. It may be an instance of “trickle-down” ownership: Viṣṇu makes a dwelling place for Manu, and in turn Manu’s people also get firmly planted. Or, Manu and the people may both be under Viṣṇu’s auspices.

As noted in the published introduction, vss. 3 and 4 are responsive. The first pāda of 4 concentrates the essence of the 1st two pādas of 3, substituting ví cakrame (of 3b) for trír deváḥ (in 3a) at the beginning of the pāda. This phrase, trír deváḥ, is short a syllable; Oldenberg suggests reading t·rir, but this seems unlikely: I don’t know of any other disyllabic readings of this extremely common numeral (either as 1st cmpd member tri- or adverbial trís). I suggest rather that the metrically disturbed opening draws attention to the beginning of this set of paired vss. by being flawed and is “repaired” by 4a. See similar remarks about 3c and 5c ad vs. 5.
