As just noted, the vs. is divided into two, with the Tṛtsus of Indra’s party in full flood in ab (on the attack, one presumes) and their enemies abandoning their possessions under the pressure of this attack. These enemies are identified as durmitrā́saḥ; as with amítra- of 9c, this descriptor seems meant to signal the fraying or loss of the alliances that bound them and perhaps also to identify these alliances as badly formed in the first place. The other example of this form as a full adj. is nearby 10 in VII.28.4; durmitrá- in X.105.11 is used as a PN in a quite possibly independent play on the PN sumitrá-.

The first hemistich is straightforward; the second has its puzzles, starting with the form prakalavíd (or, theoretically possible, -vín) in c. See, first, Oldenberg, who rejects several previous suggestions and hesitantly follows what is found in Grassmann, as does Geldner (as do I): a root-noun cmpd. with √vid ‘know’, a 1st member related to kalā́- ‘small part’ (VIII.37.17), used adverbially (Grassmann ‘die kleinsten Theile berechnend’ à ‘kleinlich’). Scarlatta (486) discusses in somewhat more detail but reaches the same hesitant conclusions. The universal uncertainty has much to do with the difficulty of fitting this sense into context. I take the cmpd as implicitly contrasted with víśvāni in d. By my interpr., the enemy forces measure their supplies precisely and parsimoniously, “knowing every little piece” (Oldenberg “mit Kunde jedes kleinsten Teils”)

-- hence my idiomatic “with a miser’s eye.” But when confronted by the Tṛtsus’
attack, they profligately abandon everything and flee.

Kümmel (608) interpr. mímānāḥ as reflexive/intrans. ‘die kleinlich sich messen’, though with ?, but, despite the middle voice, the other forms to this stem are consistently transitive.
