Most interpr. (Geldner, Oberlies [Rel. RV I.441], Renou, Doniger, Wh [AV]), take kṣatríyam here as masc. personal ‘ruler’, modified by the part. dhāráyantam, while I take it as neut. ‘rule’ (as it sometimes is; cf. IV.20.3, V.69.1) and the obj. of the participle. The problem with the standard interpr. is that the part. has nothing to govern, and in fact a number of interpr. supply a second kṣatríyam (or kṣatrám; see Renou) to occupy that role. Cf., e.g., Geldner “… den Herrscher, der fälschlich (die Herrschaft) führt.” However, Lü (419), Lommel, and Brown interpr. as I do.
