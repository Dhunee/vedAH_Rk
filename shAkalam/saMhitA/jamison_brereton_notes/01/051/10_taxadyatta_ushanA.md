A nice adjacency figure, nṛmaṇo manoyujaḥ.

Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) supplies “with strength” with pū́ryamānam ‘being filled’, but Renou’s “with soma” (an alternative allowed by Geldner in his n.) seems more likely on the basis of other “fill” phrases involving Indra. Esp. apposite is V.34.2, adduced by Geldner, where Indra fills his belly with soma while Uśanā offers him a weapon, much as here.

Indra’s exhilaration in the immediately following verse here (11a) also supports the soma interpretation.
