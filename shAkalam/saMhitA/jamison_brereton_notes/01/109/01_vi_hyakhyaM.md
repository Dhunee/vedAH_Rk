The kinship theme of the first hemistich is continued in pāda c, with prámati- ‘solicitude’, since this abstract noun is regularly identified with the father -- e.g., I.31.10 tvám agne prámatis tvám pitā́si naḥ. See further disc. ad I.71.7.

These two vss. are parallel in structure, with an initial hí clause with a 1st sg. augmented verb of perception (‘see’, ‘hear’), with kinship terms in the second pāda, and in the last pāda a 1st sg. verb of production (‘fashion’, ‘beget’) with a verbal product as obj. (‘thought’, ‘praise’).
