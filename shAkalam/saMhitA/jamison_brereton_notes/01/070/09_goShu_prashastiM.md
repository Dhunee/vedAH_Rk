Note the vocabulary associated with human kingship: práśasti- ‘panegryic, laud’ and balí- ‘tribute’. Since kings receive práśastis rather than bestowing them and since the verb dhiṣe is medial (whatever else it is morphologically), the tr. of Oldenberg SBE and Geldner whereby Agni bestows the práśasti (e.g., Geldner “du legst Wert auf die Kühe, auf die Hölzer”) seem incorrect to me, esp. with the semantic bleaching of práśasti to ‘worth, value’ (Oldenberg ‘excellence’). Although the phrase is distinctly odd, I think the point of “you receive/acquire a laud among cows and firewood” is that both the butter oblations represented by the cows and the firewood make noise when in contact with fire, and this noise can be interpreted as an audible expression of praise.

For another instance of prá √śaṃs in Parāśara’s oeuvre, see I.73.2.

See Proferes (pp. 48-49) on these contrastive verses. Note the complementary bháranta / bharanta beginning 9c and ending 10d respectively. Their relationship and their semantic contrast is emphasized by the vi(…)s: bháranta ví(śve)… ví … bharanta.

See Proferes (pp. 47-49), esp. for the identification of the Vaiśvānara fire in particular with the sun, and the published introduction. and the art. cit, esp. for the encoding of the Vaiśvānara fire by the successive grammatical subjects víśve (9cd) and náraḥ (10ab).
