The nonce verbal form vipanyā́mahe has attracted a remarkable amount of discussion; for a detailed and clear summary see Kulikov (-ya-presents, 143-46), though his passive/reciprocal interpr. I cannot follow. Insofar as there has been a standard analysis of it, it has been as a passive to √pan ‘admire’ (Wh Rts, reflected in Geldner’s tr.), but other root associations and morphological analyses abound, which I will not discuss further. It belongs with a group of other, better-attested formations: fem. noun vipanyā́- and adj. vipanyú-, which I take as ‘admiration’ and ‘seeking/expressing admiration’ respectively. (This point was made forcefully by Thieme in Fs. Risch [1986: 165-66], though I do not follow his ultimately etymology.) (For a similar system, cf. vasūyá-(ti), vasūyā́-, vasūyú-.) I take vipanyā́mahe as a denominative -yá-verb associated with these nominal forms, derived from the root √pan (in my view); it is transitive in value and takes vām as object. With Thieme (an analysis fld. by subsequent interpr. Kulikov Witzel Gotō), I take the last part of pāda b, ví paṇír hitā́vān, as a separate nominal clause, but unlike these interpr. I take it as the main clause attached to the causal clause beginning in pāda a.

The phonological play of vipan(yā́mahe) ví paṇ(ír) clearly contributed to the word choice here, as Kulikov also notes. As for the sense of this hemistich, it simply rephrases the purport of vs. 6: because we singers are doing our job in the ritual economy by praising the gods, our patron is being generous to us and cannot be labeled a ‘niggard’.

The poet then turns to the Aśvins’ part in this system and in 7cd presents another causal clause, parallel to the one in ab. Note the parallel openings 7a vayáṃ cid dhí and 7c ádhā cid dhí. This subordinated causal expression continues into vs. 8, with another parallel causal clause occupying 8ab and introduced in a similar way: 8a yuvā́ṃ cid dhí. In my, admittedly complex, interpr. of these verses, the 1st plural singers of 7ab modulate into the single (3rd ps.) singer Agastya in 8cd; this modulation is eased by not naming him until we reach the triumphant main clause of 8cd, where he boasts of the great wealth he has acquired from his poetry -- just like the singers of 7ab. And the transition from 1st ps. singers to 3rd ps. singer is enabled by omitting both subj. and verb in 8ab, where a human ritualist or ritualists should be the agents (see below) but where the ps. and no. of any verb would be problematically telltale.

The series of causal clauses begins by highlighting the Aśvins’ benevolent participation in the ritual system (7cd) and then the complementary activity of the priest in summoning them to the sacrifice and offering to them first (8ab) -- before coming to the logical conclusion in 8cd: that Agastya has achieved his just reward and is himself acclaimed among men.

With the standard tr. I take anindyā in 7c as a predicted voc., with c and d separate clauses, as the double hí suggests.
