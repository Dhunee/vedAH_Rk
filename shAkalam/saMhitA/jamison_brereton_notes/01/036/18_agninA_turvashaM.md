Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) takes dásyave sáhaḥ as a phrasal personal name “Dasyave Sahas,” a personal name that would have to be neuter. Better to follow Oldenberg (SBE) by taking it as a qualifier of Agni. Renou also rejects the personal name interpr., but considers it a pāda-final truncation of the instr. sáhasā. (Because sáhaḥ can be construed without problem as the nom./acc. neut. it appears to be, there is no reason to resort either to Renou’s truncation or to an archaic instr. sg. zero-grade ending *-h1 in the mode of Hale [Fs. Melchert].) Oldenberg’s interpretation finds support in 19, where the second pāda contains an entirely parallel phrase qualifying Agni, with neut. noun construed with benefactive dative: jyótir jánāya “a light for the people.”
