‘Forelock’ for pravarga- may seem slightly flippant, but I wanted to capture the ‘twist’ sense of prá √vṛj, in contrast to the anodyne ‘having slaves at the front’ found in the other tr.

The final bṛhántam of d obviously refers back to the rayím so carefully detailed in ab, but is separated from that phrase by a considerable amount of material. Rather than making it a long-delayed part of that NP I have taken it as a pseudo-goal with vibhā́si, with vā́ja-prasūtā giving grounds for that goal.

Contra Grassmann, áśva-budhya- cannot mean ‘durch Rosse bemerkenswerth’ with a gerundive to √budh, among other things because of the bahuvrīhi accent. Rather it belongs with áśva-budhna- ‘having a foundation of horses’, by way of *-budhnya-, an analysis that goes back to Aufrecht. All 3 occurrences of this stem (I.92.7-8, 121.14) qualify wealth or prizes. On the related hapax áśva-budhna- see comm. ad X.8.3.

vibhā́si (8c) and ví bhāti (9b) should have been rendered with the same English verb, either “radiate” or “shine.” I would now change the published translation, to ‘radiate’ in both cases.
