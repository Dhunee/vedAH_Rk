The signature word of this vs. is sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- ‘joint(ly), conjoined’, which occurs prominently in the first three pādas. The final pāda is dense with phonological and etymological play: vṛ́ṣṇaḥ … vṛṣaṇā́vṛṣethām.

Geldner (explicitly) and Renou / Klein (DGRV I.373) / Witzel Gotō (all implicitly) take vṛtrahaṇā in b as a predicate vocative (so, “you two, conjoined, are Vṛtra-smashers”).

I would prefer this interpretation, but think that the lack of accent should be taken seriously. Moreover, given the repetition of sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- just noted, it may be that the conjunction of Indra and Agni is what is being highlighted, not their Vṛtra-smashing.

As noted in the published introduction, vs. 3 attributes Indra’s characteristic deed (Vṛtra-smashing) to both gods, while vs. 4 attributes Agni’s characteristic ritual behavior to both.
