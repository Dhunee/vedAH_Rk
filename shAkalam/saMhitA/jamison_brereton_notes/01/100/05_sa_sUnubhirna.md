The participial phrase śravasyā̀ni tū́rvan has a close parallel in VIII.74.10c yásya śrávāṃsi tū́rvatha. I translate the latter as “whose claims to fame you bring to triumph.” Given the similarities I would change the tr. here to “along with the nestmates bringing to triumph (deeds) worthy of fame.”

The pattern of instrumentals set in vs. 4 -- “X with the X-es,” that is, “X among the X-es” -- appears to continue in 5a and c, but the instrumentals there are used differently.
