The two cmpds índratamā and marúttamā, superlative in form, are generally taken to mean ‘most similar to Indra / the Maruts’ (Grassmann, Geldner, Witzel Gotō). I suppose that is their ultimate purport, but I think the effect is stronger: the Aśvins are said to possess the qualities of those gods in an even higher degree than those gods themselves do.

Idiomatic English would use the comparative: “more Indra than Indra” (or, in a wellknown colloquial expression, at least in my childhood, “more Catholic than the Pope”).

The two 2nd dual middles, vahethe (2c) and āsāthe (3a), would both be better metrically with light 2nd syllables. On this phenomenon, see Arnole 129-30. A number of 2nd and 3rd dual middle forms invite this shortening. I do not understand it historically since Aves. has the ā in the athematic forms and the equivalent of e in the thematic ones (-aēte,- ōiϑe).
