The sense of pāda a would be better conveyed by “what are you doing there?” The main cl. kím āsāthe lacks an expressed antecedent to jáno yáḥ in the following rel. cl., but it is not difficult to supply.

The two 2nd dual middles, vahethe (2c) and āsāthe (3a), would both be better metrically with light 2nd syllables. On this phenomenon, see Arnole 129-30. A number of 2nd and 3rd dual middle forms invite this shortening. I do not understand it historically since Aves. has the ā in the athematic forms and the equivalent of e in the thematic ones (-aēte,- ōiϑe).
