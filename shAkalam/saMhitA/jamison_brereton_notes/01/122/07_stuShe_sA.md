The transition between the All God portion of the hymn and the dānastuti is eased by verbal repetition: Mitra and Varuṇa, who were the last gods invoked (6ab), are again called on here, though in opposite order and not in a dvandva but in individual vocatives (varuṇa mitra versus 6a mitrāvaruṇā). Independent rātíḥ picks up the 2nd cmpd member in śrótu-rātiḥ (6c) and the PN śrutáratha- (7c) also echoes śrótu-rātiḥ.

The locc. pajré / śrutárathe priyárathe mark these men as givers, which makes some trouble, since Kakṣīvant’s family seems to be called Pajra (quite possibly in the next verse and in I.126.4-5) and Kakṣīvant himself pajriyá- (I.116.7, 117.6, 120.5). Nonetheless, grammar can’t be gainsaid, and they must be patrons here. See Geldner’s n. 7bc for attempts to reconcile the discrepancies.

The passively used 3rd sg. stuṣé (7a), stuṣe (8a) contrast in function with the great majority of stuṣé / stuṣe forms, which are 1st sg. and “active” in sense (“I (will) praise”). This rare usage may be mediated through the perception of the accented forms as infinitives; see disc. ad X.22.1.
