There are a number of interconnected difficulties in this verse, mostly focused on what is happening in cd and the relation of this hemistich with the first one. I take … ca yé maghávānaḥ … as the second part of an “X and which Y” construction with naḥ in pāda a in Wackernagel’s Position: “… for us and (for those) who, our benefactors …” Oldenberg (SBE), Renou, and Witzel Gotō (if I am reading this last correctly) also consider “us” and our benefactors to be the conjoined terms, though with differences in detail. Geldner, however, takes the benefactors as conjoined with Agni, and they should also √vī our hymns and thought along with Agni. The frequency with which maghávānaḥ (and also sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’) are conjoined with forms of the 1st pl.

favors the non-Geldner interpr.

Another issue is the identity of the verb iṣáyanta in d. Geldner seems to take it with the fairly well-established stem iṣáyati ‘prospers, derives benefit’ (“… soll günstig aufnehmen”), similarly Renou (“jouissent”) and Witzel Gotō (“sich … erquicken”). With Oldenberg (SBE) I take it as meaning ‘send, propel’ and ultimately a deverbal formation from iṣnā́ti, via *iṣāyáti, of the type gṛbhṇā́ti, gṛbhāyáti, gṛbháyati.

The final problem is the form tánā. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) and Renou take it as an instr. of accompaniment “along with their offspring/descendents.” This is not impossible, but this meaning is ordinarily found in the collocation tanvā́tánā ca (e.g., VI.49.13). By itself tánā occurs several times with girā́(e.g., I.38.13, II.2.1) “with song at length,” and I take it that way here as well, semantically construable with mánma ‘prayers’ at the end of the hemistich.
