Strictly speaking, given the position of ná, the apsú should go with the frame, not the simile: “he hisses in the waters, like …” This is presumably a reference both to the myth of Agni’s hiding in the waters treated earlier in the hymn and to his identification with Apām Napāt, but the haṃsá- is surely sitting in the waters, too - though the primary point of comparison is the hissing noise both make.

How to construe gen. viśā́m is not clear. I take it loosely as a datival gen. with the cétiṣṭhaḥ, while Renou considers it dependent on a “virtual” viśpáti- (“le plus remarquable … de (ceux qui président aux) tribus”), and Geldner and Witzel Gotō, in slightly different ways, take it as dependent on uṣarbhúd (Geldner “der Frühwache der Ansiedelungen”; Witzel Gotō “der von Niederlassungen am Morgen wach wird”). Proferes’s rendering is quite awkward, but closest to my own in intent: “the clans' brightest as concerns strategems.”
