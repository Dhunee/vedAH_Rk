This verse contains no main clause, just two different subordinate clauses introduced by yé (ab) and yád (cd) respectively, with the first couched in the 3rd ps., the second in the 2nd ps. Although such switches of person in the middle of a verse are far from rare in the RV (see in fact vs. 5), in this case it seems best to consider the first half of this verse a pendant to vs. 3 (also in the 3rd ps.) and the second half an anticipation of vs. 5 (also in the 2nd ps.), esp. since 5a is an abbreviated duplicate of 4cd.

The adj. manojúvaḥ ‘mind-swift’ could equally well be a nom. pl. masc.

modifying the Maruts or an acc. pl. fem. modifying pṛ́ṣatīḥ. Most tr. opt for the latter, I think correctly on thematic grounds, but grammatically and semantically either is possible. Grassmann and Macdonell (Vedic Reader) take it as a nominative; certainly its position right before marutaḥ in pāda a, with pŕṣatīḥ appearing only in the middle of the second pāda, suggests that the initial audience interpretation would be as a modifier of the Maruts.

Verse 5 is an intrusive Triṣṭubh in this Jagatī hymn. (The final verse is also in Triṣṭubh, but meter change is more usual in concluding verses.) The transition between the meters is cleverly managed here (as Oldenberg already pointed out): the final word of 4d (in Jagatī) and 5a (in Triṣṭubh) is áyugdhvam. The ending has the distracted reading -dhu vam in 4d, but is simply -dhvam in 5a. The reason for the change in meter is unclear to me.
