Geldner and, apparently, Renou (but not Witzel Gotō) take ānṛce not to √ṛc ‘chant, praise’, but to a different root ‘hold’ (with sám ‘hold together’). (See also Oldenberg’s disc., though he ultimately opts for ‘praise’.) But as Kü says (106), such recourse to “eine sonst unbekannte Wurzel” is not helpful. Though Geldner claims that in context ‘chant, praise’ is excluded, in the context of the whole verse it works fine, as Oldenberg points out. That the first verbal form in the next verse is gṛṇāné ‘being sung’ (though modifying Heaven and Earth, not the Sun) supports this interpr., esp. since ānṛce and gṛṇāne are near anagrams.
