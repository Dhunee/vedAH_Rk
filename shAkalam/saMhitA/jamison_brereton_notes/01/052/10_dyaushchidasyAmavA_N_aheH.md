I agree with Geldner (against Pp, Grassmann, Oldenberg, Renou, Witzel Gotō) that loc. vájre should be read for Pp. nom. vájraḥ and that this locative is functionally, but not grammatically, parallel with áheḥ svanā́t “from the sound of the serpent.” With Geldner and Oldenberg (and back at least to Ludwig), I see no choice but to accent the apparent voc. rodasī as ródasī. In the published translation it should therefore be marked with an asterisk.
