The referent of bhándiṣṭha eṣām “the most fortunate one of these” is not clear.

However, since he is conjoined with “our patrons” and patrons are often conjoined with “us” (as in the next verse), referring to the poet-performers (explicitly II.2.12 stotā́raḥ … sūráyaś ca), it is likely a singer or poet, perhaps even this very poet, referring to himself in the 3rd ps.

These three middle verses, before the refrain becomes reintegrated into the verse, begin identically: prá yát, though the sense of yád in 3-4 differs from that in 5.
