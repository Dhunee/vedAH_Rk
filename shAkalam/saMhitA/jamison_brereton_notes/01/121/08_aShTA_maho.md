The major puzzle in this verse is the grammatical identity of its first word, aṣṭā́. Geldner takes as the agent noun to √aś ‘attain’, which is not otherwise attested (and for which we should expect full grade *naṣṭár-), while Oldenberg, Renou, Scarlatta (602), Witzel Gotō take it as ‘eight’ (which of course requires some clever manoeuvering with its head noun, dual hárī). I follow Sāyaṇa, Grassmann in taking it as the ppl. to √(n)aś.

On the sense of vātā́pya- see comm. ad IX.93.5. The scansion of this stem is unclear: Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition give it as vā̃tā́pyam, that is, presumably, vāatā́pyam, Arnold (p. 294) vaatā́pyam (with short first vowel), but Oldenberg vātaā́pyam. Ad IX.93.5 he also suggests vātā́piyam (which wouldn’t work here), pronouncing the scansion favored by Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition the least likely. Grassmann also goes for -piya-.
