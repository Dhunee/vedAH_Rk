I do not understand the length in ūgrá- here and 10c. Lubotsky (2000 [“Vedic root vṛ …,” Indoarisch, Iranisch und die Indogermanistik]: 320 n. 16) attributes it to compensatory lengthening from *hí uHgrás, after laryngeal metathesis from *hi Hugrás, but I find the proposed metathesis counterintuitive (despite the other exx. he adduces); one would rather expect the laryngeal to remain where it is as a hiatus-filler. Moreover, assuming that this remained as a synchronic rule in the RV is quite hard to accept.

Indra adroitly manipulates the wording here to contrast his own solitary state with the Maruts’ collectivity: … mā́m ékaṃ samádhatta “… me alone together you…”

Indra seizes the Maruts’ assertion of independent power (svadhā́- 5d) by taxing them with the absence of (their exercise of) that power (6a) at a crucial moment. Another skirmish in the battle of the lexicon.
