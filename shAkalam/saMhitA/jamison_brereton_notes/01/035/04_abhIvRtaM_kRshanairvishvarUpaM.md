I take kṛṣṇā́rájāṃsi loosely as an accusative of extent. Others (Geldner, Renou) supply a verb to govern this phrase (‘verbreitend’ and ‘pour traverser” respectively), while still others (Macdonell, Falk 1988, Witzel Gotō) take it as a second acc. with dádhānaḥ, as appositive to táviṣīm “assuming the dark realms as his power.” This latter solution is possible grammatically and does not require additional material to be supplied, but I am somewhat dubious that the dark realms constitute his power.
