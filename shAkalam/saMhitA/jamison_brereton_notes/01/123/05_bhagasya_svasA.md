The final phrase dákṣinayā ráthena with two instr. identifies the dakṣiṇā and the chariot, unlike either of the proposed readings in 1a (see comm. there). Grassmann, followed (perhaps surprisingly) by Oldenberg, suggests reading *dákṣiṇāyā(ḥ) here, with the gen. supposedly found in 1a. Oldenberg ascribes the change to attraction to the instr.

ráthena. The proposed emendation would do no violence to the meter (and would in fact produce a somewhat more common break), but since the text is easily comprehensible as transmitted, I see no reason to emend.
