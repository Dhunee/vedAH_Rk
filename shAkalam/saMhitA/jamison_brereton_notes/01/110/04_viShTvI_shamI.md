I do not understand why the Ṛbhus are called vāghát- here, since this term is ordinarily used of ritual officiants (see comm. ad I.3.5) and the Ṛbhus only indirectly participate in ritual. Geldner tr. “die fahrende (?) Sänger,” but he provides no support for the itinerant part of the tr.

As Geldner points out, sū́ra-cakṣas- is characteristic of gods; in I.89.7 it is used almost as a definition of such. So it may well here be an ancillary indication that the Ṛbhus achieved divine status.
