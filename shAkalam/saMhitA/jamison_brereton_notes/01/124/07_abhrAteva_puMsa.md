On the female figures here, see published introduction. Though most interpr. (see recently Scarlatta [463], Witzel Got≈ç) see only a male figure in the simile in b (a charioteer seeking prizes), I find it unlikely that the middle simile of three, the two outer of which depict striking female types, would compare Dawn only to a male. As indicated in the published introduction, I think it is a double entendre, with not only the prizeseeking male competitor on his chariot seat but also a prostitute displaying herself on a platform or stage for money (or whatever counted for money in that period).
