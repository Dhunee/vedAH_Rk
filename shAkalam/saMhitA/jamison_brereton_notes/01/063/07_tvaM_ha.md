“one after the other” is my attempt to render an “object-distributive” value for the intensive dardaḥ. (For this notion see Schaefer 1994: 86-87, though she considers dardar- lexicalized and does not attribute this sense to it, pp. 135-36.) The use of várg ‘you twisted’ differs in tone in simile and frame. In the frame it is distinctly hostile and destructive, but in the simile it simply expresses the ritual action of twisting the barhis grass into seats for the visiting gods.

tváṃ ha tyád provides the opening of the next four verses. Although tyád is a neut. pronoun and in 4a could function as the object of the otherwise object-less codīḥ, in the following verses it does not have pronominal function; the expression X ha tyád is a way of providing emphasis, particular of the 2nd ps. pronoun (cf., e.g., VII.19.2, VIII.96.16-18). I would now be inclined to tr. the vss. in this sequence with “It was just you who …” rather than the rather recessive “You then, …”
