The gerundive atasā́yya- is taken by Geldner as belonging to √at ‘wander’ and tr.

“soll … erreichbar sein,” while most (Gr, Renou (?), AiG II.2.286, Hoffman, Witzel Gotō) take it to mean “to be asked for/begged” and derived from the hapax atasī́- supposedly ‘beggar’ (VIII.3.13). But this is entirely circular, with the meaning of each of these two words determined on the basis of the other, with an occasional nod towards √at ‘wander’ as their possible root (whose relevance Mayrhofer casts doubts on; see EWA s.v. atasī́-). I instead take it as a negated gerundive to √taṃs ‘tug, yank, shake’, which forms a similar gerundive to its intensive, vitantasā́yya-. Negated gerundives do not ordinarily take accent on the privative (AiG II.1.217), and the derivational opacity of atasā́yya- would make it likely to receive the usual -ā́yya- gerundive accent. Geldner also suggests the possibility of derivation from √taṃs in a note.
