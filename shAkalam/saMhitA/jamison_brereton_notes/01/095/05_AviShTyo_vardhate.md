The hymn began with unnamed dual feminines attending to the young fire; this verse also contains unnamed dual feminines in the same role. But the identities of the two pairs are different: Night and Dawn in 1, the world-halves in 5cd, 6a.

Note the word play of pratīcī́… práti, with slightly different meanings.

The caus. (práti) joṣayete in 5d, 6a literally means “they two cause (him) to take pleasure (in themselves),” but this tr. seems too heavy, esp. in adjacent pādas.
