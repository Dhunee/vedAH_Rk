The position of simile-marking ná is aberrant, preceding the simile’s noun méne and following the verb. Since the full simile is bhadré … ná méne, it seems that this syntagm was distracted in some fashion, with the verb placed in its middle. On méne see I.62.7.

The etymological figure in c, dákṣāṇāṃ dákṣapatiḥ “skill-lord of skills,” then participates in a phonological figure with semantically distinct dakṣiṇatáḥ “from the right (/south)” in d.

The caus. (práti) joṣayete in 5d, 6a literally means “they two cause (him) to take pleasure (in themselves),” but this tr. seems too heavy, esp. in adjacent pādas.
