For the “deep-structure pun” in pāda b, see the published introduction. and Jamison 1982/83 and 2007: 110-12. That the action in this clause is not to be taken literally is, I think, signalled by the iva in the main clause in pāda a, which introduces the heroic deed (vīryàm) supposedly depicted in b. My “as it were” renders the iva.

In c Geldner takes the wives (pátnīḥ) as the wives of the gods, but in this Vṛtra context it makes more sense to take them as the (fem.) waters whom Indra had just released. Recall that in the great Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32 (as well as in V.30.5, VIII.97.18), the waters are called dāsápatnīḥ (vs. 11), “whose husband was a dāsa” (that is, Vṛtra). This might be clearer if the published translation read “His wives.” The interpretation of the final part of this pāda, váyaś ca, is disputed. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) and Renou take it as an acc. of váyas- conjoined with tvā (“dir … und deiner Kraft”). However, already Sāyaṇa considered it the nom. pl. of ví- ‘bird’, which is equally possible grammatically, and I have adopted this interpr. (Oldenberg seems tacitly to accept this interpretation, by citing X.80.5, which also contains birds.) Sāyaṇa’s suggested referent is the Maruts, which makes good sense. The two groups on site at the Vṛtra battle and able to give encouragement and praise to Indra then were the waters and the Maruts, who, in many accounts of the myth, provided Indra with moral and tactical support.
