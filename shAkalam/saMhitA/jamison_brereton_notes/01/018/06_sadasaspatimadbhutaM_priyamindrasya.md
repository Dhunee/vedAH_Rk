ayāsiṣam: I take this form to the root √yā ‘beseech, implore’, not to √yā ‘drive, go’, which does, admittedly, have a well-attested -siṣ-aorist. So also Witzel Gotō, though other translators (including Schmidt, Bṛhaspati und Indra) render as a verb of motion (Geldner “habe ich … angegangen”). That interpretation isn’t impossible, but ‘beseech’ fits the context better.
