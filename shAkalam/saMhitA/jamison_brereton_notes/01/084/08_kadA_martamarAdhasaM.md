The hapax kṣúmpa- is universally rendered by modern tr. as ‘mushroom’, though there is no unanimity in earlier interpretations (cf., e.g., Grassmann: Staude [perennial plant]). There is some etymological support for ‘mushroom’ from modern languages (see EWA s.v.), and ‘mushroom’ works well in the simile, since kicking many varieties of mushroom demolishes them, whereas a perennial plant is generally a sturdier entity. I might go so far as to suggest specifically a puffball, since kicking puffballs releases a satisfying cloud of dust (easily viewed on various YouTube videos), and puffballs do appear to be found in the appropriate geographical area.

Bloomfield (Rig-Veda Repetitions, ad I.7.8) suggests that each of these three verses reads like a brahmodya, with the last two words (the four-syllable tag índro aṅgá, which he considers to be prose “quite out of the metre”) serving as the answer. This analysis words best for vs. 7, but his separation of the two-word tag from the rest of the verse is clearly correct for all three verses -- though I do not think we need to consider índro aṅgá “simple prose.”
