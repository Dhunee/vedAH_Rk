vyáti- from *vi-yati- (√yam), flg. Renou

Renou takes vimímānaḥ in d as reflexive ‘se mesurant’, and Geldner’s ‘sich richtend’ is close. Since med. forms of (ví) √mā are regularly transitive (cf. vimamé rájāṃsi in the previous hymn, I.154.1b, sim. I.154.3cd), I would supply an object here. In the published translation I tentatively suggest “the realms,” as in 154.1, but given the contents of this verse I would now supply “the year.”
