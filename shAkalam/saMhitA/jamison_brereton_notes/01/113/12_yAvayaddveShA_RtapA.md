Pāda b contains complex phonetic echoes: sumnāvárī sūnṛ́tā īráyantī, with repeated su/ū as well as mirror-image árī / īrá mediated by ṛ́; the n in each word and the final ī of the first and third could be added.

In c the phrase bíbhratī devávītim is somewhat puzzling; devávīti- generally refers to humans’ ‘pursuit of the gods’, that is, the fervent invitation to the gods to partake of our sacrifice. It should not, therefore, be something that Dawn “brings,” as she brings prizes, for example. I therefore take the fem. part. bíbhratī in its birth sense: she bears / brings to birth our pursuit of the gods by waking us up to initiate this pursuit. Cf. a similar birth context in 19d.

These verses have a surprising density of forms of ví √vas ‘dawn forth’ (7b, d, 8c, 9b, 10b [2x], 11b, 12d, 13a, b, c), whereas vss. 1-6 lack any such forms -- though there’s a teasing echo in 4b ví … āvaḥ ‘She opened, uncovered’, belonging, however, to √vṛ. See also comments on vs. 14.
