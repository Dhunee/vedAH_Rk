The idiom punar √vṛdh ‘grow again’ recurs from 2b, again referring to the plants immolated by the fire (at least in my opinion; others take the subject to be the flames). Here their regeneration is linked with their contact or merger with divinity.

The final pāda is variously interpreted. I take the plants still to be the subject and the form “different from their parents” refers to their burned residue as ash and cinders, as opposed to the branches and leaves that were fed to the fire. But if pitróḥ is taken as a loc., the referent may be different; some take it as referring to Heaven and Earth (Sāyaṇa, Oldenberg [SBE], Witzel Gotō).

This trio of verses treats the union (by burning) of the hyper-masculine Agni/fire and the plants (feminine). This must be the “der erotische Grundton” of the hymn that Geldner mentions in his introduction. This sexual union leads to the death of the plants (8b) and their regrowth and transformation into a different form (7cd, 8). Or so is my interpr.; acdg. to some, the flames are sometimes the referents, rather than the plants.

This proposed split reference seems to me to break the thematic unity of the verses and the climax in 8 of the death and renewed life of the females who unite with Agni.
