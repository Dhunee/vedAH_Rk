The concentration of intensives continues in this verse: námnate (a), róruvat (b), davidhāva (d).

The ‘bending’ of pāda a of course describes the flickering motion of the flames.

Because of the theme mentioned ad vss. 6-8, of the bodily transformation of the plants by burning, I take tanvàs in c as referring to the bodies of the plants, not, with most tr., that of Agni.

I don’t entirely understand the position of ca in c. Klein (DGRV I.222-23, 259-60) suggests that it has been bumped by the participle opening the clause and pāda. It is certainly the case that ca could not immediately follow that first word without metrical distress: five-syllable ojāyámānaḥ entirely fills the opening, and since the caesura cannot precede an enclitic, placing ca after the participle would result in an opening of 6.

This trio of verses treats the union (by burning) of the hyper-masculine Agni/fire and the plants (feminine). This must be the “der erotische Grundton” of the hymn that Geldner mentions in his introduction. This sexual union leads to the death of the plants (8b) and their regrowth and transformation into a different form (7cd, 8). Or so is my interpr.; acdg. to some, the flames are sometimes the referents, rather than the plants.

This proposed split reference seems to me to break the thematic unity of the verses and the climax in 8 of the death and renewed life of the females who unite with Agni.
