Again there is a difference of opinion as to referent. With Oldenberg (SBE) I take the plants once again as the subjects of pāda a (so, partly, Witzel Gotō), contra Sāyaṇa, Geldner, Renou, Kümmel (419), who interpret them as flames.

This trio of verses treats the union (by burning) of the hyper-masculine Agni/fire and the plants (feminine). This must be the “der erotische Grundton” of the hymn that Geldner mentions in his introduction. This sexual union leads to the death of the plants (8b) and their regrowth and transformation into a different form (7cd, 8). Or so is my interpr.; acdg. to some, the flames are sometimes the referents, rather than the plants.

This proposed split reference seems to me to break the thematic unity of the verses and the climax in 8 of the death and renewed life of the females who unite with Agni.
