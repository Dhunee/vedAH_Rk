All standard tr. take b vṛṣabhásyeva te rávaḥ as the main cl. to the yád cl.

beginning in a, while I take it as a part of that yád cl. There is no way to tell, since the second cl. lacks a verb whose accent or lack thereof would settle the matter.

There are also no semantic implications; I weakly prefer mine because of the fairly emphatic ā́d ‘then, just after that’ beginning the second hemistich.

All tr. take vanínaḥ as ‘trees’ (lit. ‘possessing wood’). This is doubtless the primary sense here, since this sequence of vss. describes a forest fire, but ‘winners’ is also possible, since the metaphorical context is that of a chariot race; see esp. 10a, 11c.

2nd du. dīdayatam (10c) and jujoṣatam (11b) are somewhat problematic forms. They belong to redupl. thematic stems; other forms to these stems are subjunctives to the perfect. However, they have secondary endings, and the act. 2nd and 3rd du. subjunctive endings should be primary. Lubotsky identifies them as impvs. (Grassmann also jujoṣatam); Kümmel (35) treats them as “hybrids” -- morphologically belonging to the subjunctive but functioning as imperatives. They differ from some other secondarily thematized pf. impvs. in having full grade of the root syllable, like the subjunctive (versus zero-graade in pīpyatam √pi, √vāvrdhásva √vṛdh, etc. -- but cf. pipráyasva √prī). In the published translation they are treated as subjunctives (“you will shine,” “you will enjoy”), but they would might be better rendered as imperatives. For further disc. of such forms, see my forthcoming article on the perfect imperative. ## 094 Agni
