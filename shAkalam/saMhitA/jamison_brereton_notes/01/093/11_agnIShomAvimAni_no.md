I supply ‘makes’ on the basis of 9c sugáṃ kṛdhi, though strictly speaking “that is an easy way” is perfectly acceptable.

tāvaká-, the vṛddhi derivative of the genitive of the 2nd ps. pronoun, enlarged with -ka-, is a striking form, though exactly what special effect it is aiming at is unclear. For the use of -ka- in pronominal derivatives, see Jamison 2009 (IIJ 52). As discussed there, the -ka- tends to signal a lower register or slangy tone.

2nd du. dīdayatam (10c) and jujoṣatam (11b) are somewhat problematic forms. They belong to redupl. thematic stems; other forms to these stems are subjunctives to the perfect. However, they have secondary endings, and the act. 2nd and 3rd du. subjunctive endings should be primary. Lubotsky identifies them as impvs. (Grassmann also jujoṣatam); Kümmel (35) treats them as “hybrids” -- morphologically belonging to the subjunctive but functioning as imperatives. They differ from some other secondarily thematized pf. impvs. in having full grade of the root syllable, like the subjunctive (versus zero-graade in pīpyatam √pi, √vāvrdhásva √vṛdh, etc. -- but cf. pipráyasva √prī). In the published translation they are treated as subjunctives (“you will shine,” “you will enjoy”), but they would might be better rendered as imperatives. For further disc. of such forms, see my forthcoming article on the perfect imperative. ## 094 Agni
