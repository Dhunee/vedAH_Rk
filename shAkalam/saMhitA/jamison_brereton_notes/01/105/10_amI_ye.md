I have no idea what the exact referent of the “five oxen” is, but given their stationing in the middle of heaven and their apparent retrograde motion, it seems that an astronomical body (a constellation?) is referred to. Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take ní vāvṛtuḥ as “sind … verschwunden,” but ní √vṛt ordinarily means ‘turn back / home’, of bovines, and given that the subject is oxen, albeit metaphorical ones, this idiom works fine in the passage.

As noted in the published introduction, these verses are the omphalos and are marked, as often, by responsion and numerology. They seem to express the poet’s vision of his connection with his distant ancestor Trita Āptya and also his vision of (somewhat unclear) cosmic phenomena.
