The part. iṣūyánt- in d is generally tr. ‘shooting arrows’ (though cf. Renou’s “qui cherche la jouissance-rituelle”; sim. Oldenberg SBE [but not Noten]), but shooting arrows seems out of place in this context, even with Geldner’s suggestion (n. 4d) that the priest is compared to a shooter because his words are arrows. Although I maintain the connection with ‘arrow’, I think it means simply ‘go (straight) like an arrow’, readily translatable into the English idiom ‘straight-arrow’, namely a person of utmost rectitude.
