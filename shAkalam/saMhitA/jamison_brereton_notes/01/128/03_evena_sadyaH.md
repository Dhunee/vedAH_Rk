The standard tr. (as well as Scarlatta. 110-11) take -gír- in muhurgī́r to √gṝ ‘sing’, rather than, with Grassmann, to √gṝ ‘swallow’. This is certainly possible, though “‘plötzlich, augenblichlich willkommen geheissen’ (?)” (Scarlatta 110; sim. Witzel Gotō) does not have much to do with what proceeds or follows in the verse. I prefer to keep Grassmann’s ‘auf einmal verschlingend’. The expression completes the description of Agni’s journey in the preceding pāda. The speed of his journey around the world, completed in a single day, is conveyed by the image of “swallowing up” the route instantly -- similar expressions are found in English. EWA (s.vv. GARI1 , GARI2 ) is uncertain of the root affiliation.
