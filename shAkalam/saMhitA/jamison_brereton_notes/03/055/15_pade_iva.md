This vs. seems to continue the theme of Night and Dawn. The anyád … anyád construction of pāda b echoes that in 11b, where Night and Dawn were first introduced, and in fact our pāda b, with one hidden and one visible, paraphrases 11b, with one shining and the other black, and forms a small ring.

Moreover, the two “set down within the wondrous one” echoes 12c ṛtásya té sádasy īḷe antáḥ “I reverently invoke the two within the seat of truth.” I take dasmáto refer to the ritual fire/ritual ground, and one of the marvels is that two such large entities (Night and Dawn) can fit into something so small.

The vs. also recycles various thematically significant lexical items: padá- (see comm. ad 14); nihité echoing ní dadhe (13b); antár (12c and passim: 2c, 5b, 5c, 8c, 9b, 12c; antár is in a sense the signature word of this hymn); anyád … anyád 11b.

The ‘pathway’ (pathyā̀) takes us back to III.54.5 where a question about “the pathway leading to the gods” (devā́m̐áchā pathyā̀) initiated the mysteries that have dogged us ever since.

The published translation is somewhat misleading, in that vápūṃṣi in 14a is tr. as “wondrous forms” and dasmé in 15a as “the wondrous one.” I might substitute “marvellous forms” for the first, to avoid the impression of an etymological connection.
