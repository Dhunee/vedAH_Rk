The 2nd member of tuvikūrmí-, an epithet of Indra, is generally now derived from the seṭ root √cari , a derivation already found in AiG I.24, 141, 152 -- hence my ‘powerfully ranging’. See EWA s.v. tuvikūrmí-. The older deriv. from √kṛ (e.g., Grassmann, Wh Rts; explicitly rejected by AiG II.2.776) is nonetheless still reflected in the standard tr.: Geldner “der Tatenreiche,” Renou (with hesitation) “aux actes (?) puissants,” Witzel Gotō “der mächtig Wirkende” -- even though AiG I (1896) predates all of them by a good margin, well over a century in the case of Witzel Gotō! There is number incongruence between the neut. sg. yád of the rel. clause and neut. pl. tyā́… vīryā̀ṇi. The yád is, as it were, an anticipatory collective: “what(ever) you did … where are those deeds?”

The next two vss. develop the theme sounded in pāda d of vs. 1.: Indra’s absence. In vs. 2 we point out that for Indra nothing is very far away, so he could, and should, easily come here, where the sacrifice is invitingly set out for him. In vs. 3 we provide a flattering description of Indra’s great powers and then plaintively ask where these powers are now.
