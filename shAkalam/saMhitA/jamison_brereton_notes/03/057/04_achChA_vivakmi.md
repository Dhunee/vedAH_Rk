The first hemistich faintly echoes 1a, with manīṣā́(4b) corresponding to manīṣā́m and vivakmi (4a) reminiscent of vivikvā́n, though they belong to two different roots (√vac and √vic respectively).

Various referents have been proposed for the feminine pl. in cd: dawns (Oldenberg), tongues, flames (Geldner), flame-tongues (Witzel Gotō). Though Renou favors flames in his tr., his comment in his notes is more illuminating: “Type d’ellipse d’un nom fém. pl., notamment dans le cycle d’Agni; plusieurs possibilités concurrentes.” This remark seems esp. apt to this hymn, with its focus on feminine entities.
