Geldner takes śaktím as an infinitive, governing a dat. vṛ́ṣṇe (flg. the Pp.): “… dem Bullen einen Dienst zu leisten wünschen.” This somewhat wayward interpr. is not followed by the other standard tr., where śaktí- receives its usual abstract sense -- though WG do preserve the datival interpr. of the ambig. Saṃhitā vṛ́ṣna (“die dem Stier das Kraftvermögen wünschen”). The more natural interpr. is Renou’s, with underlying gen. vṛ́ṣṇaḥ: “qui recherchent la force-active du taureau,” and my tr.

reflects that.

As Geldner suggests, the “sisters” in ab are the fingers of the officiant that produced the ritual fire with the kindling sticks; the cows in cd may be the gheeoblations or (supported by vss. 1-2) the hymns accompanying the production of the fire, or both.
