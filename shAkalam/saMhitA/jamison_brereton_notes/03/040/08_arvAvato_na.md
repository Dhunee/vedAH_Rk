This is the only vs. in the hymn without a form of índra- (7 of the 8 of those forms being vocatives, the lone exception índram in 7b). Here voc. vṛtrahan is substituted.

On the “magic square” of these vss., see published introduction. Vs. 9 actually seems to be covering the logical possibility that Indra might not be either far or near but somewhere in between, and in that case the exhortation in vs. 8 to come from nearby or far away might not work.</details>
