The standard tr. take úpa barhíḥ with the next pāda (“call you to the ritual grass”); Sāyaṇa. agrees with my version (see Geldner’s n. 1c). There is no principled way to decide, and very little depends on it.

It is not easily possible to register the pun of havya(vā́haḥ) ‘oblation’ (to √hu ‘pour’) and havante (to √hvā ‘call’).
