2nd ps. reference to Indra returns here, in kuvíd clauses otherwise parallel to the one in 4cd with 3rd ps. ref.

Geldner (fld. by Witzel Gotō and by me) takes the pf. part. papivā́ṃsam as expressing the cause of Indra’s action.

The transmitted Saṃhitā text ma ṛ́ṣim must be read contracted, as márṣim (so Holland & van Nooten Rig Veda edition) to achieve a Triṣṭubh line; the Pp. correctly analyzes this sandhi sequence as mā ṛ́ṣim.
