Pādas a and c contain feminine plural nom./acc. forms: jaítrīḥ and jānatī́ḥ … uṣā́saḥ respectively. Although the default assumption would be that they are coreferential and both refer to the Dawns, the familiar plot line of the Vala myth suggests rather that they identify two different subjects: the (unexpressed) Aṅgirases in ab, the (expressed) Dawns in c. (So Geldner, Renou, Schmidt [Bṛhaspati und Indra, 167]; Oldenberg agrees that the Aṅgirases should be supplied as subj. in a, but takes jaítrīḥ as obj. [presumably alongside clear acc. spṛdhānám], while Witzel Gotō take the Dawns as subj. of a, but supply the Aṅgirases as subj. of b.) The Aṅgirases are Indra’s back-up band in the Vala myth, as noted above ad III.30.10, and would be expected to accompany him, as pāda a depicts, while the Dawns are still confined within the Vala cave and only in c recognize Indra’s song and come out of the cave. The problem for an Aṅgiras reading of pāda a is of course the fem. gender of jaítrīḥ. Here it is probably best to follow Sāyaṇa. in supply víśaḥ ‘clans’ (so Geldner, etc.); cf. I.121.3 viśā́m áṅgirasām.

However, note that the Aṅgirases are referred to by the fem. pl. vā́ṇīḥ ‘choir’ in the preceding hymn, III.30.10, and that noun could be supplied here. The cows of d are surely the dawns, as often; Indra becomes their páti-, a word meaning both ‘lord’ and ‘husband’. On the naming of Indra here, see the intro.

remarks above.
