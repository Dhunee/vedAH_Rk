Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take this vs. as a quotation of the Aṅgirases’ praise-song of Indra.

I do not see why. The vs. seems to follow easily from the preceding one, and in fact at the end of vs. 7 it’s Indra who’s singing (/chanting), not the Aṅgirases. We might expect such a quotation to be signposted in some way. I do not consider the 1st pl.

enclitic naḥ in c to be a sufficient signal.

The presence of Śuṣṇa in b is a bit puzzling, since the smiting of Śuṣṇa is not part of the Vala myth. Perhaps with Schmidt (173) he is mentioned because Indra is uncontestably Śuṣṇa’s killer, and this extra-mythic (or extra-Vala myth) association makes it clear that the unnamed subject of this vs. must indeed be Indra.

The standard tr. take c as a separate clause from d and supply a verb of motion with prá (e.g., Geldner “[ging] … voran”). This is certainly possible, but cd can also be read as a single clause (so Schmidt, 168), since prá is frequent with √muc.

This interpr. allows, but does not enforce, a coreferential interpr. of naḥ (c) and sákhīn (d), as in my tr. (flg. Schmidt).

What calumny? Geldner (n. 8d) suggests the dishonor because of the loss of the herd.

Given the thematic weight the part. árcan carries (see comm. immed.

above) and given that it occupies pāda-final position in 7d and 8c, it should have been tr. the same way in these two vss. I would emend the published translation to ‘chanting’ in 7d, or else 8c to ‘singing’ and arkaíḥ in 9b, 11b to ‘songs’. The instr. arkaíḥ reappears in pāda-final position in 11b.
