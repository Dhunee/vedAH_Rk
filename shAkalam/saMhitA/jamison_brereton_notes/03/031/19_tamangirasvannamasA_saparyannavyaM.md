Pāda b, návyaṃ kṛṇomi … purājā́m “I make new (the hymn) born of old,” is about as succinct a summary of the RVic poetic enterprise as we can find in the text: the poets’ focus on ever new expressions based on traditional techniques and themes. In this particular case, Geldner suggests that purājá- refers to the Preislied of the Aṅgirases, about which we heard in vss. 7-8.

On the √dhā + inf. construction, see vs. 13 above.
