It is not clear who the “others” (anyā́n) are whom he keeps away, but the medial pf. in the next pāda (cakre) implicitly claims that he did the great things (mahā́ni; cf. vīryā̀ṇi … mahā́ni in III.36.1cd) by himself, that is, without the help of others.

I assume that purudhá-pratīka- in 3d refers to Indra’s shape-shifting powers; the cmpd seems to be “unpacked” in 4b “he made this body as he wished” (yathāvaśáṃ tanvàṃ cakra eṣáḥ).

These two vss. are noteworthy for containing 3 gerunds, upasthā́ya, abhibhū́ya, and āmúṣyā. The quest of the poet(s) of the Indra hymns in III to find a way to express anteriority (see disc. ad III.32.9-10, 33.11) is successful at least in this passage.</details>
