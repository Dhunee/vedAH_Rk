Though Grassmann classifies prábhartum as an infinitive, and Oldenberg’s and Witzel Gotō’s tr.

seem (indirectly) to reflect this analysis (“dass man ihm darbrachte …”), the form seems to be simply a -tu-abstract (somewhat concretized)(so tr. Geldner and Renou). As is well known, the -tum form that serves as the only infinitive in Classical Sanskrit is hardly found in early Vedic. Macdonell (VG §586b) registers only five in the RV (not including this one) and an equal number in the AV. prábhartu- here seems more or less equivalent to prábhṛti- or prábharman-, though the -u-stem datives bhártave (IX.97.50) and ápabhartavaí (X.14.2) are infinitival.

Notice the near rhyming openings to the two half-verses, a: #sadyó h(a), c: \#sādhóḥ.
