The sáhūti-, a joint invocation (with another god or gods), may be a sore subject for Rudra. As pointed out in the published introduction, he receives only three hymns dedicated to him alone in the RV; otherwise two hymns joint with Soma and incidental mentions in hymns to other gods. He may feel slighted. See also disc. ad VI.49.10.
