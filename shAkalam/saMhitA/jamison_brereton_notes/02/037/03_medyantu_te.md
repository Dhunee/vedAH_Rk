Although the default referent of the voc. vanaspate in a ritual context might be assumed to be the sacrificial post (cf. III.8.1, 3, 6, 11), the contents of ab -- both the draught animals of a and vīḍayasvā in b -- point rather to the chariot. See VI.47.26 cited by both Geldner and Renou Why the chariot is addressed and identified with the wealth-giver is not clear to me, save for the fact that in the later ritual the Ṛtugraha libations take place in the cart shed (see, e.g., Eggeling, SBE 26.319-20).

Note that the havirdhāna carts are the subject of the last tṛca of nearby II.41 (vss. 19- 21).

The d pādas of the first three vss. have a rigid structure: PRIEST’S CUP sómaṃ draviṇodaḥ píbartúbhiḥ. Noteworthy is only that píba is accented in all three vss., though there is no obvious reason for this, and the last three vss. (4-6), which also contain imperatives to √pā, though of different form (4d pibatu, 5d pibatam, 6d pāyayā), in syntactically variant constructions, lack such accent. I have no explanation (and it seems not to have attracted any attention) beyond the suggestion that píbartúbhiḥ is treated as a detachable refrain, even though what precedes it in the pāda must be construed with it. See now also remarks ad III.32.1.
