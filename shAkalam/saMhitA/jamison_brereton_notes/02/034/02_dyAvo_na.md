aryáḥ is morphologically multivalent; I take it as nom. sg. to aryá-, with most (Grassmann, Geldner [/Witzel Gotō], Macdonell, Thieme [Fremdling], Lubotsky, Maurer). Renou instead interpr. as acc. pl. to arí- (“les êtres-privilégiés”), in apposition to víśvāni … bhúvanā, and it must be admitted that its position between those two words invites it to be construed with them. Doniger seems to follow Renou (“all noble creatures”), but I do not understand how she interpr. aryáḥ grammatically. It could also be gen. sg. of arí- (or nom. pl., though this would not fit syntactically). ### 03-04 These two vss. are closely knit together verbally. Both contain an etymological figure, with nom. pl. fem. and acc. sg. masc. derived from the same root: 3c śúciṃ śúcayo, 4a yuvatáyo yúvānam. The √śuc of 3c recurs in 4c as śukrébhiḥ, which forms a phonetic figure with adjacent śíkvabhiḥ. The repeated PREVERB yánti … PREVERB yanti of 3a is echoed by PREVERB yanti of 4b, while 3d and 4b both end with a formulaic expression in which only the verb varies: 4b … pári tasthur ā́paḥ, 4d … pári yanti ā́paḥ. And finally 3d, 4b, 4d (and 5c) all end with forms of áp- ‘water’ (nom. pl., loc. pl.), contrasting with the pāda-initial gen. pl.

apā́m when the god is mentioned (1c, 2c, 3d).

Note the concentration of pṛSIB forms: 2d pṛ́śni yāḥ, 3d prk̥ ṣám … pṛ́ṣatībhiḥ, 4a prk̥ ṣé, 4c pṛ́ṣadaśva (and scrambled -śiprā in 3c, rapśa- in 5a).

The first words of each hemistich in this series of vss. echo each other: 1a úpem, 1c apā́m, 2a imám, 2c apā́m, 3a sám, 3c tám, 4a tám. Since similar openings are found only in scattered vss. later in the hymn (9a apā́m, 11c yám, 12c sám) I consider the effect deliberate.
