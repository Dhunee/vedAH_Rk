The identity of the three female goddesses is unclear. They could be, with Sāyaṇa., the three who show up in the Āprī hymns (e.g., II.3.8), Iḍā, Sarasvatī, and Bhāratī -- though even if so, this does not help much, since the role of those goddesses is not well defined. A (possibly) different set of three females associated with Agni is found in II.5.5, but that passage is too obscure to aid interpretation here.

Macdonell (fld. by Doniger and Maurer) suggests that they are the waters of the three worlds, but I am not aware of a “waters of the three worlds” trope.

A more acute problem in this vs. is kṛ̥́tā (in sandhi before vowel; Pp kṛ́tāḥ) in c. There is no agreement as to what stem it belongs to or what grammatical form it represents. Some simply refuse (or fail) to tr. it (Geldner, Doniger, Schaeffer 198-99); others give it a contextual meaning (Macdonell ‘breasts’, Renou ‘plantes’, Maurer ‘nurses’), without attempting etymological justification. Witzel Gotō suggest ‘Spinnerinnen’ (female spinners, spinsters in fact) with a derivation from √kṛt. What makes the word so difficult is the root accent; it would otherwise be easily interpreted as a past participle to √kṛ. The most sensible disc. of the word is Oldenberg’s. He sees it a sexual slang, as in the expression kanyāṃ √kṛ, glossing “die Engjungferte” (deflowered girl). Certainly in English “to make” or “to do” a girl/woman is a perennial slangy verb for “have sex with,” and one can also adduce the expression “to make (s.o.) a woman,” for “deflower, have sex with a virgin.” He justifies the accent retraction from the ppl. kṛtá- (or rather fem. kṛtā́-) on the basis of AiG II.1.19-20, where substantivized adjectives retract their accent. This seems the best hypothesis of a generally bad lot, and it would fit the context, in that pāda d describes Apām Napāt sucking the first milk of females who’ve given birth for the first time (if that’s what pūrvasū́- means; see Scarlatta 620-21) -- which makes sense if the females just lost their virginity in the preceding pāda. I therefore take the word as an acc. pl. fem. to a substantivized kṛ́tā- from the ppl. to √kṛ.
