The descriptor ásmera-, generally taken as a derivative of √smi ‘smile’, is somewhat curious. It may be simply, as Macdonell suggests, that the waters approach their task seriously, not like light-hearted lovers (sim. Doniger). Or (with Maurer) that they are shy. But I somehow think that this hapax is expressing something more particular, though I cannot define it more closely. It may be naturalistic: the circling waters perhaps whirl around without foam, which might be thought of as smiles. Or it may be meant to distinguish these attentive females from other natural phenomena: lightning, especially, is characterized by smiling (see I.168.8) and laughing, and Uṣas also smiles. Though the waters do gleam (see 3c), they are different from those bright celestial females, and the point may be to emphasize the two very different environments in which Apām Napāt finds himself -- the watery and the fiery. Note that in 9b Apām Napāt “clothes himself in the lightning flash” in 9b, but by then his assimilation to Agni/Fire is almost complete.

Note the concentration of pṛSIB forms: 2d pṛ́śni yāḥ, 3d prk̥ ṣám … pṛ́ṣatībhiḥ, 4a prk̥ ṣé, 4c pṛ́ṣadaśva (and scrambled -śiprā in 3c, rapśa- in 5a).

The first words of each hemistich in this series of vss. echo each other: 1a úpem, 1c apā́m, 2a imám, 2c apā́m, 3a sám, 3c tám, 4a tám. Since similar openings are found only in scattered vss. later in the hymn (9a apā́m, 11c yám, 12c sám) I consider the effect deliberate.
