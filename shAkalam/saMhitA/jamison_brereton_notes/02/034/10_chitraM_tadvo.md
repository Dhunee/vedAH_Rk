This vs. strenuously develops the “golden” theme that appeared in 9d -- a color more descriptive of the fiery than the watery. An even stronger indication of the transition to Agni proper is the gerund niṣádyā ‘having sat down’: the lexeme ní √sad is closely associated with Agni’s installation on the ritual ground (see, e.g., the next hymn, II.36.4).

The ends of the d pādas in these vss. are very similar: 10d … ánnam asmai, 11d … ánnam asya. In 10d “The givers of gold give food to him” implies that his food is gold; 11d further makes clear that the gold(en) food is really gold-colored ghee.
