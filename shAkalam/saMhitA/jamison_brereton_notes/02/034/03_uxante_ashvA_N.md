My rendering of nadásya kárṇaiḥ “with the ‘ears’ of the reed(-whip)” follows Pischel’s sugg. (Ved. Stud. I.191; see Geldner’s n. 3bc and Oldenberg) that nadá- is here ‘reed’ (cf. I.32.8) (beside naḍá- ‘id.’) rather than ‘roarer’ and that it refers to a whip or riding crop of some sort. I suggest that the “ears” would be some part of the whip, perhaps knots on the whiplashes or the like. Pischel’s idea has been generally rejected (though Oberlies [Relig. II.247] seems to accept it); see esp. Oldenberg’s negative remarks. But the alternative notion, that the Maruts are directing their horses by the ears of a(nother? side?) horse makes no sense to me: how would such direction work? And although Oldenberg explicitly states that the number is not an issue, referring to plural (not dual) ears of a single horse (or even several horses, since pairs of body parts generally are referred to in the dual even when several individuals are in question) seems problematic to me.

In my interpr. the two instr. pls. kárṇaiḥ and āśúbhiḥ are separate. So also Oldenberg, Renou, though they otherwise accept the lead-ear theory. But Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) construe them together (“with swift ears”), which in my view makes a puzzling interpr. even more so.

The next question is how to interpr. the intensive part. dávidhvataḥ. Though the stem is usually transitive, Geldner (/Witzel Gotō) take it absolutely (“schüttelnd”), while Renou supplies an obj. seemingly at random (“qui secouez-puissamment (le monde)”). I extract ‘lips’ (śípra-) from the cmpd. híraṇyaśipra-, since du. śípre serves as object to just this participle in X.96.9.

The pṛkṣám of d should not be severed from pṛkṣé beginning 4a, though at least in Geldner’s (/Witzel Gotō’s) tr. the connection is not signalled (Renou’s rendering does connect them). In general thematic pṛkṣá- refers to a strengthening substance, esp.

nourishment. The corresponding root noun pṛ́kṣ- has the same basic sense (see Schindler, Rt Noun, s.v.), but here in the dat. is used infinitively (so also Schindler, as well as the standard tr.). The phrase pṛkṣáṃ yātha may well be a syntagm, judging from the PN pṛkṣá-yāma in I.122.7 (adduced by Oldenberg), and the acc. appears to be a goal, contra Geldner’s (/Witzel Gotō) rendering of pṛkṣám as an adverb (“kräftig”).

Note the concentration of pṛSIB forms: 2d pṛ́śni yāḥ, 3d prk̥ ṣám … pṛ́ṣatībhiḥ, 4a prk̥ ṣé, 4c pṛ́ṣadaśva (and scrambled -śiprā in 3c, rapśa- in 5a).

The first words of each hemistich in this series of vss. echo each other: 1a úpem, 1c apā́m, 2a imám, 2c apā́m, 3a sám, 3c tám, 4a tám. Since similar openings are found only in scattered vss. later in the hymn (9a apā́m, 11c yám, 12c sám) I consider the effect deliberate.
