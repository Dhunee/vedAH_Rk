The combination of honoring Agni “in the seat of the waters” (a) and the Bhṛgus “once again” installing him among the clans (b) suggests that this vs. concerns the well-known myth of Agni’s flight and concealment in the waters and the Bhṛgus’ discovery, recovery, and reinstallation of Agni as the ritual fire. X.46.2 begins with a pāda identical to our pāda a and then relates the Bhṛgu’s finding of the fire gúhā cátantam “hiding in secret”: imáṃ vidhánto apā́ṃ sadhásthe, … padaír ánu gman / gúhā cátantam uśíjo námobhir, ichánto dhī́rā bhṛ́gavo ‘vindan “This one here

-- having done honor to him in the seat of the waters, they followed him along his
tracks ... / With reverences seeking him who was hiding in secret, the fire-priests, the insightful Bhrgus ̥ found him.” The same myth may be alluded to, in ring compositional fashion, in vs. 9 of our hymn. Note also that the poet to whom this hymn is ascribed is Somāhuti Bhārgava.

As Ian Hollenbaugh pointed out to me, dvitā́dadhur in 2b can be read, contra Pp. adadhur, as dvitā́dadhur, with perfect indic. or pres. injunc.; I now favor the unaugmented reading for reasons given below.

The contrast between the verbs in 2ab imám … (a)dadhur bhṛ́gavaḥ and 3ab agníṃ devā́saḥ … dhuḥ seems to encode the primal installation of Agni by the gods (3) and the recent installation, by men (2). Why the primal installation is expressed by a root aor. injunc. is not clear to me, but I would now alter the published translation to “Agni did the gods install …,” from “Agni have the gods installed …,” to reflect the remote past. Note also that the opening of 3b is metrically aberrant, with an opening of 3.

Holland &amp; van Nooten Rig Veda edition suggest a rest in 4th position. It would be possible to restore *dadhuḥ, which would match the same verb in the same position in 2b, but I think it’s more likely that the omission of a syllable is meant to call attention to the difference in verb stems. A rest in 3rd position, producing a syncopated dhuḥ might be better. If the two verbs are being directly contrasted, an unaugmented dadhur in 2 is more likely than augmented adadhur (in order to highlight the difference in stems). Discussion with Ian Hollenbaugh has helped me clarify my interpr.
