The far-reaching 1 steward 2 has taken all goods 3 in his right hand, and strongly advancing does not let them loose; desirous of glory he does not let them loose. For every supplicant 4 thou hast carried the oblations to the gods 5. For every righteous one he procures a treasure; Agni opens both folds of the door (for him).
