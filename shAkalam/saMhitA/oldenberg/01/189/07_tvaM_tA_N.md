1 Thou, O Agni, distinguishing both (kinds of men, the pious and the impious, or the Aryans and the Dasyus 2), eagerly approachest (Aryan) men at (the time of) the advancing (day) 3, O worshipful one. At (the time of) rest thou hast become governable to the man (or, to Manu; or, thou art to be praised by men 4); thou art to be smoothed down like a horse 5 by the Usigs.
