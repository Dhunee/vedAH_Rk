May we, the sacrificers, call thee hither, the best of sacrificers 1, the first of the Aṅgiras, O priest, with our prayers, with priestly prayers, O bright one 2: thee who like the heaven encompassest the earth 3, the Hotri of human tribes, the manly flame-haired, whom these folks—whom all folks should favour in order to speed him (to our sacrifice).
