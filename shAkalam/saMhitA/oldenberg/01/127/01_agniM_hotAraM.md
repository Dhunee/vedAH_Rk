I deem Agni to be the munificent Hotri, the Vasu, the Son of strength 1, Gâtavedas, like a priest, Gâtavedas 2: the best performer of the sacrifice, the god who with his upright body that is turned towards the gods, and with his flame longs for the shine of the (boiling) ghee 3, of the butter that is offered in (the fire).
