Let your praise go forth to the great Agni, who is mighty in his might, who awakens at dawn, like a winner of cattle 1â€”let it go forth to Agni. When (the worshipper) rich in offerings has loudly praised him 2 in all lands 3, he wakes 4 like a singer in front of the dawns 5, the flaming one (?), the Hotri (in front) of the dawns 5.
