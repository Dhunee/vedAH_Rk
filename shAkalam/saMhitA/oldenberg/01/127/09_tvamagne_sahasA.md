Thou, O Agni, art born, the mightiest by might 1, for the divine world, the strongest one, like wealth for the divine world. For thy delight is most strong, and thy power is most brilliant. And they walk around thee 2, O (god) who never growest old, like obedient (servants), O (god) who never growest old.
