1 To thee, O Agni, belongs the Hotri's and the Potri's office exercised at the appointed season; to thee belongs the office of the Neshtri; thou art the Agnîdh 2 for the righteous. To thee belongs the office of the Prasâstri; thou actest as an Adhvaryu, and thou art the Brahman and the master of the house in our house 3.
