### English translation:

“The flowing waters having known the origin of earth and heaven; may they now hear (our praises).”

### Commentary by Sāyaṇa: Ṛgveda-bhāṣya

Waters: an allusion perhaps to the subsequently received cosmogony, as in **Manu**, that water was the first ofcreated things
</details>

<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton</summary>

They know the means of begetting of earth and of heaven;  
the waters listen then, even as they flow.
</details>

<details><summary>+Jamison Brereton Notes</summary>

Geldner (n. 2a), flg. Sāyaṇa., takes the waters as subj. of vidúḥ and suggests that the point is that the waters are older even than Heaven and Earth: they are the Urelement.

They therefore were around for the creation of H+E and know all about it. In the absence of any other obvious subject, this seems reasonable.

In the 2nd hemistich the function and position of ádha are somewhat puzzling.

Klein (DGRV II.96 n. 23) lists it with passages with the “logical conjunctive value” ‘therefore’. But he does not tr. it or comment on its non-clause-init. position, and I find it difficult to wring a ‘therefore’ sense out of it. In the Prol. (369 n. 1) Oldenberg 43 suggests that the PB parallel (I.2.9, VI.6.17) with the reading adhaḥ ‘below’ is correct and the RV should be emended, but he essentially drops that idea in the Noten, remarking that RV ádha is “tadellos” and that the emendation would also require altering the accent (to adháḥ). Our passage is reminiscent of IV.17.10 ayáṃ śrṇ̥ ve ádha jáyann utá ghnán, which I tr. “this one is famed for conquering and smiting.” Both passages have a mid-clause ádha that introduces a pres. participle or participles and both contain a form of √śru. See comm. ad IV.17.10. In both cases I think ádha opens a mini-clause that modifies or expands on the main verb. In our passage I think the point is that, though rivers are very noisy when they flow (as is often emphasized in Vedic texts), these waters also know how to listen. Note also that in our case ádha is pāda-initial, though not clause-initial.
