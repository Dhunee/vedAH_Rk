Lüders (Varuṇa 450) comments about the tṛca that it concerns only the songs sung to Indra; therefore in the refrain ṛtá- can only refer to “die Wahrheit des Liedes,” and the refrain ṛtásya yád is paraphrase for “das Lied.” I agree that the refrain refers to the verbal product offered to Indra, but prefer to supply ukthá- ‘(solemn) speech’, extracted from ukthá-vāhas- in 13a for 13c and 14c.
