‘वृषा सोम' इति त्रिंशदृचं चतुर्थं सूक्तं मारीचस्य कश्यपस्यार्षं गायत्रं पवमानसौम्यम् । तथा चानुक्रान्तं- वृषा सोम कश्यपः' इति । उक्तो विनियोगः ।।

Soma Pavamāna  
Kaśyapa Mārīca  
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
The hymn begins with an insistent tr̥ca establishing Soma as a bull. What follows is  for the most part a conventional treatment of the purification process, with special  emphasis on his entry into “the sea” (that is, the purificatory waters, vss. 8, 16, 17,  19, 27). The association with the Sun found in the preceding hymn is also present  here, with Soma not merely yoking the Sun’s horse, Etaśa, but identified with him  (vs. 19) and with the Sun himself in the final words of the hymn (vs. 30; see also  vss. 7, 9). Soma’s light and brilliance are also mentioned throughout (vss. 1, 8, 13,  15, 28).
