The next two vss. develop the theme sounded in pāda d of vs. 1.: Indra’s absence. In vs. 2 we point out that for Indra nothing is very far away, so he could, and should, easily come here, where the sacrifice is invitingly set out for him. In vs. 3 we provide a flattering description of Indra’s great powers and then plaintively ask where these powers are now.
