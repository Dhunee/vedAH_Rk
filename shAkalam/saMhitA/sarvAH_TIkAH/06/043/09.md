This tṛca-final vs. reprises and repurposes some of the statements in the opening vs. 7. The skill (dákṣa-) that Soma found in 7a we ask him to bestow on us in 9a. Soma, “having won” (sasavā́n) in 7c, is asked to help us in winning (sātaú … aviḍḍhi) in 9d. Unfortunately nothing in 9 sheds light on the problematic instr. phrase in 7c.

VI.44.10-12: This tṛca foresees various disasters and tribulations and asks Indra for his help in combatting them.

On the meter of this tṛca see Oldenberg, Proleg. 91 and Holland &amp; van Nooten Rig Veda edition metrical comm. The fading in and out between Virāj and Triṣṭubh is further complicated by the openings of 3 in 11-syllable lines in 7b, c.

The tṛca concerns soma and contains lexical and thematic responsions.
