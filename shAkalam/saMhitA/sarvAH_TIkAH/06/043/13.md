The first hemistich contains disharmony of number in a constructio ad sensum: The priest is urged to offer of the pressed (soma-drink)s in the plural (sutā́nām); the reason for this is immediately given in the 2nd part of pāda b, sá hy àsya rā́jā “for he is its king.” Unaccented singular asya presupposes a referent already in the discourse, with “it” referring to soma, represented in the previous clause as a plural. The singular is then continued in the rest of the tṛca (asyá 14a, tám … sómam 14cd, sutám … sómam 15a, with sg. sutám picking up pl. sutā́nām of 13a).
