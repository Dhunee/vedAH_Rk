30 [^7] . ['The firm, powerful eye of Mitra, glorious splendour, strong and prosperous, a chaste, flowing vesture, this skin I put on, a valiant (man).']


[^7]:  This Sūtra is wanting in most of the MSS. (see the note, p. 48 of the German edition). It contains the Mantra with which the Ajina (the hide mentioned in Sūtras 2, 4, 5 of this chapter) is put on. Nārāyaṇa gives the Mantra which he says is taken from the Mādhyandina-Gṛhya (in the Pāraskara-Gṛhya it is not found), after chap. 2, 3, and he states that the corresponding act to which it belongs has its place after the rites concerning the girdle (chap. 2, 1) and the sacrificial cord (2, 3).
