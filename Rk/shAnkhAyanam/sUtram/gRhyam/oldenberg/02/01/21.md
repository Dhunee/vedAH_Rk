21 [^4] . That of the Brāhmaṇa shall reach the tip of the nose,


[^4]:  There is no doubt that prāṇasammito (which Nārāyaṇa explains thus, 'prāṇa is the wind [or breath]; [the staff should] reach to the place where the wind leaves the body, i.e. to the tip of the nose') should either be corrected into, or explained as, ghrāṇasammito; the Śāmbavya MS. has ghrāṇāntiko brāhmaṇasya. Comp. Gautama I, 26, &c. The parallel texts agree in assigning the longer staff to the higher, not as Śāṅkhāyana does, to the lower caste.
