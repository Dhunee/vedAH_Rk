18 [^8] . In that way, according to what Ṛṣi each hymn belongs to and what its deity and its metre is, thus (with the corresponding indications of Ṛṣi, &c.) let him recite each hymn;


[^8]:  I do not think that Professor Weber (Indische Studien, X, 132) has quite exactly rendered the meaning of these Sūtras when he says, 'The teacher then (i.e. after the formula of Sūtra 17 has been pronounced) teaches him first the Ṛṣi, the deity, and the metre of each Mantra. In case he does not know them himself for a Mantra, he recites the holy Sāvitrī (tat Savitur vareṇyam). After this he teaches him in due order either (1) the single Ṛṣis, i.e. the hymns belonging to each Ṛṣi, or (2) the single Anuvākas,' &C.It does not seem quite probable to me that the student should have had to learn first the Ṛṣis, deities, and metres of the whole Veda, before the text of the hymns was taught him; I rather believe that hymn by hymn the indication of the Ṛṣis, &c. preceded the anuvacana of the text itself, and with this opinion the statement of Nārāyaṇa agrees, 'Evaṃ pūrvoktena prakāreṇa ṛṣidevatāchandaḥpūrvakaṃ taṃtaṃ Agnim īḷa ityādikaṃ mantraṃ māṇavakāyācāryoऽnubrūyāt.'
