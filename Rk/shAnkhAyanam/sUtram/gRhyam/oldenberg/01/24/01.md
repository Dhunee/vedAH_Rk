1 [^1] . Now the Gātakarman (i.e. ceremony for the new-born child).


[^1]:  24, 1. Comp. Dr. Speijer's essay on the Jātakarman (Leiden, 1872). Nārāyaṇa observes that, as it is prescribed below (chap. 25, 4) that a mess of food is to be cooked in the sūtikāgni, here the sūtikāgni is established, and sacrifice is performed therein. The Sūtra I, 25, 4, from which it is to be inferred that the sūtikāgni should be kept, is considered, accordingly, as a Jñāpaka (see Professor Bühler's notes on Āpastamba I, II, 7; Gautama p. 50 I, 31; Nārāyaṇa's note on chap. 25, 4, p. 133 of the German edition).
