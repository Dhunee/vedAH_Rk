1 [^1] . After the Āgrahāyaṇī (or the full moon day of the month Mārgaśīrṣa) (follow) the three Aṣṭakās in the second fortnight (of the Mārgaśīrṣa and of the two following months).


[^1]:  12, 1. On the Aṣṭakā festivals, of which some texts reckon three, while others have four, comp. Weber, Naxatra (second article), pp. 337, 341 seq.; Bühler, S.B.E., II, p. 214; Ludwig, Rig-veda, vol. iv, pp. 424 seq.; Atharva-veda III, 10. The last Aṣṭakā, which is celebrated in the dark fortnight of Māgha, is called Ekāṣṭakā; this Aṣṭakā is called the 'wife of the year,' 'the image of the year,' 'the disposer of the days.' If the Phālguna month is reckoned as the first of the year, this Aṣṭakā precedes the year's beginning only by a few days; there are also some Vedic passages which point to the Ekāṣṭakā's following shortly after the beginning of the year; see Weber, loc. cit., p. 342.
