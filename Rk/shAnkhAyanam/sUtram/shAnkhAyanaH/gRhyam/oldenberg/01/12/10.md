10 [^3] . At the wedding one cow, when the Argha ceremony has been performed; in the house one cow: these are the two Madhuparka cows.


[^3]:  As to the meaning of arhayitvā I differ from the opinion of Nārāyaṇa (see his note on p. 127 of the German edition), who takes gām as the object of this verb (gām arhayitvā pūjayitvā mātā rudrāṇām ity ṛcaṃ japitvā [comp. Pāraskara I, 3, 27]). The real meaning of arhayati is, to perform the Argha ceremony for a guest. Evidently in this Sūtra two different occasions are stated on which the Argha reception, eventually with the killing of a cow, should be performed; firstly, the bridegroom should be so received in the house of the bride's father; secondly, when the newly-married people have arrived at their own house, an Argha reception should there be offered to them, perhaps, as the commentaries state, by the Ācārya.
