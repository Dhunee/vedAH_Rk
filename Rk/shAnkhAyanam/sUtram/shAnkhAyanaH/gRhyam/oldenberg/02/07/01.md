1 [^1] . Now (follows the exposition) of the study of the Veda.


[^1]:  7, 1. Nārāyaṇa: 'Now (atha), i.e. after the observance of the Śukriya vrata,' &c. On the Sukriya vrata which has to be undergone before the Anuvacana treated of in this chapter can be performed, see the note on chap. 4, 1, and below, chap. II, 9. One would have expected that in the arrangement of Śāṅkhāyana the rites belonging to the Sukriya vrata would precede the exposition of the Anuvacana. Perhaps it was in consequence of the exact analogy of the Sukriya with the Śākvara, Vrātika, Aupaniṣada vratas, that the description of the former has been postponed till the latter had to be treated of.
