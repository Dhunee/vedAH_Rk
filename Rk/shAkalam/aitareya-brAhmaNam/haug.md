### FOREWARD 
THE EDITOR. Dr. Martin Haug's translation of the Aitareya Brahmana has been out of print for a long time, and so it has been reprinted as an extra volume in the series of the Sacred Books of the Hindus. To facilitate references to the original edition, paging of that edition has been given in Square brackets, thus [ ]. It has not been considered necessary to reprint the 

Sanskrit text, as better editions of that text are now available. 

Extracts from Professor Max Müller's review of this work are repro. duced below: 

The Aitareya-brâhmana, containing the earliest speculations of the Brahmans on the meaning of their sacrificial prayers, and the purport of their ancient religious rites, is a work which could be properly edited nowhere but in India. It is only a small work of about two hundred pages, but it presupposes so thorongh a familiarity with all the externals of the religion of the Brahmaps, the various offices of their priests, the times and seasons of their sacred rites, the form of their innumerable sacrificial utensils, and the preparation of their offerings, that no amount of Sanskrit scholarship, such as can be gained in England, would have been suficient to unravel the intricate speculations concerning the matters which form the bulk of tho Aitareya-brahmana.......... 

The ancient Indian ceremonial, however, is one of the most artificial and complicated forms of worship that can well be imagined; and though its details are, no doubt, most minutely described in the Brahmapas and the Satras, yet, without having seen the actual site on which the sacrifices are offered, the altars constructed for the occasion, the instruments employed by different priests-the tout-ensemble, in fact, of the sacred rites the reader seems to deal with words, but with words only, and is unable to reproduce in his imagination the acts and facts which were intended to be conveyed by them.......na 

Dr. Haug succeeded, however, at last in procuring the assistance of a real Doctor of Divinity, who had not only performed the minor Vedic sacrifices, such as the fall and new moon offerings, but had officiated at some of the great Soma sacrifices, now very rarely to be seen in any part of India. He was induced, we are sorry to say, by very mercenary considerations, to perform the principal ceremonies in a secluded part of Dr. Haug's premises. This lasted five days, and the same assistance was afterwards ren dered by the same worthy and some of his brethren whenever Dr. Haug was in any doubt es to the proper meaning of the ceremonial treatises which give the outlines of the Vedic sacrifices. Dr. Haug was actually allowed to taste that sacred beverage, the Soma, which gives health, wealth, wisdom, inspiration, nay immortality, to those who receive it from the bands of a twice-born priest ... vse 

After having gone through all these ordeals. Dr. Haug may well say that his explana. tions of sacrificial terms, as given in the notes, can be relied upon as certain ; that they proceed from what he himself witnessed, and what he was able to learn from men who had inherited the kowledge from the most ancient timas..-•**** 

In the preface to his edition of the Aitareya-brahmana, Dr. Haug has thrown out some new ideas on the chronology of Vedic literature which deserve careful considera tion. Beginning with the hymns of the Rig-veda, he admits, indeed, that there are in that collection ancient and modern hymns, but he doubts whether it will be possible to draw a sharp line between what has been called the Chhandas period, representing the free growth of sacred poetry, and the Mantra period, during which the ancient hymos „Were supposed to have been collected and new ones added, chiefly intended for sacrificial purposes. Dr. Haug maintains that some hymns of a decidedly sacrificial character should bo ascribed to the earliest period of Vedic poetry. He takes, for instance, the bymns describing the horse-sacrifice, and he concludes from the fact that seven prieste 

only aro mentioned in it by name, and that none of thom bolonge to the class of the Udgåtars (singers) And Brahmans (superintendents), that this hymn was written beforo the estabiishment of these two classes of priests. As these priests are mentioned in other Vedic hymns, he concludes that the hymn describing the horse-sacrifice is of a very early date. Dr. Haug strengthens bis caso by a reference to tho Zoroastrian coromonial, in which, as he says, the chanters and superintendonts are entirely unknow, whereas the other two classes, tho Hotars (reciters) and Adl varyus (assistants) are mentioned by the samo names as Zaotar and Rathwiskare. The establishment of the two new classes of priests would, therefore, seem to have taken placo in India after tho Zoroastrians had separated from the Brahmans ; and Dr. Haug would ascribe the Vodic hymns in which no more than two classes of priests are montioned to a period preceding, others in which the other two classes of priests are mentioned to a period succeeding, that ancient schism ...com 

According to Dr. Haug, the period during which the Vedic hymns were composed extends from 1400 to 2000 B. C. The oldest hymns, however, and the sacrificial formulas he would place between 2000 and 2400 B. O. This period, corresponding to what has been called the Chhandas and Mantra poriods, would be succeeded by tho Brahmaga period, and Dr. Haug would place the bulk of the Brålmanas, all written in prose, betwoen 1400 and 1200 B, C. He does not attribute much woight to the distinction made by the Brah mang themselves between revealod and profane literature, and would place tho Sutras almost contemporaneous with tho Brâbmanas. The only lixed point from which ho starts in his chronological arrangement is the date implied by the position of tho solstitial points mentioned in a littlo treatise, the Jyotiga, a date which has been accurately ixed by the Rov. R. Main at 1186 B. 0.* Dr. Haug fully adınits that such an observation was an absoluto necessity for the Brahmans in regulating thoir calondar ise... 

This argument of Dr. Haug's scems corroct as far as tho dato of the ostablishmont of the ceremonial is concernod, and it is curious that several scholars who have lately written on the origin of the Vodic calendar, and the possibility of its foreign origin, should not have perceived the intimato rolation between that calendar and the whole coremonial system of the Brahmans. Dr. Haug is, no doubt, perfoctly right whon ho claims tho invention of the Nakşatras, or tho Lunar Zodiac of the Brahmans, if wo may so call it, for India ; ho may be right also when ho assigns the twelfth century as the earliest dato for the origin of that simple astronomical syston on which the calendar of the Vodio festivals is founded. Ho calls the thicories of others, who havo lately tried to claim tho first discovory of tho Naksatras for China, Babylon, or some other Asiatic country, absurd, and takes no notice of tho sanguine expectations of certain scholars, who imagino they will soon havo discovered tho very means of the Indian Nakatras in Balylonian inscriptions. But does it follow that, because the ceremonial prosupposes an observation of the solstitial points in about the wolfth century, thoroforo the theological works in which that coremonial is explained, commented upon, anal furnished with all kinds of maystorious imeanings, woro composcd at that early dato ? Wo soc no stringency wlatovor in this argumont of Dr, llaug's, ard wo think it will be necessary to look for other anchors by which to fix the drilling wrecks of Vedic literature..........

PREFACE, 

The present work is the first edition, and first translation of one of the most important works of the Brâhmaņa literature............ 

The editing of the text and the translation of the numerous stories contained in the work was a comparatively easy task, and might have been carried out as well in Europe by any respectable Sanscrit scholar in possession of the necessary materials obtainable there. But the case stands different with the translation of the technical parts of the work and principally the numerous explanatory notes which are indis pensable for an actual understanding of the book. Though Sâyana's excellent Commentary, which I have used throughout, is a great help for making out the proper meaning of many an obscure word, or phrase, it is not sufficient for obtaining a complete insight into the real meaning of many terms and passages occurring in the work. Besides, a good many passages in the Commentary itself, though they may convey a correct meaning, are hardly intelligible to European Sanscrit scholars who have no access to oral sources of information. The difficulties mainly lie in the large number of technical terms of the sacrificial art, which occur in all Brâhmaņas, and are, to those uninitiated into the mysteries of this certainly ancient craft, for the most part unintelligible. It is, there fore, not surprising that no Sanscrit scholar as yet ever attempted the translation of the whole of a Brahmana; for the attempt would, in many essential points, have proved a failure. 

What might be expected in the explanation of sacrificial terms from scholars unaided by oral information, may be learnt from the three vol umes hitherto published of the great Sanscrit Dictionary, compiled by Bahtlingk and Roth. The explanations of these terms there given (as. well as those of many words of the Samhita) are nothing but guesses, having no other foundation than the individual opinion of a scholar who never made himself familiar with the sacrificial art, even as far as it would be possible in Europe, by a careful study of the commentaries on the Sûtras and Brâhmaņas, and who appears to have thought his own con jectures to be superior to the opinions of the greatest divines of Hindustan, who were especially trained for the sacrificial profession from times immemorial. These defects of a work which is in other respects a 

ve 

monument of gignatic toil and labour, and on account of its containing numerous references and quotations extremely useful to the small number of Sanscrit scholars who are able to make independent researches, have been already repeatedly pointed out by Professor Theodor Goldstücker, one of the most accurate Sanscrit scholars in Europe. Although his remarks excited the wrath principally of some savants at Berlin, who had tried to praise up the work as a masterpiece of perfection and ingenuity almost unparalleled in the history of lexicography, they are, nevertheless, though in some points too severe, not quite so undeserved and unjust, as the defenders of the Dictionary made them to appear. Goldstücker justly does not only find fault with its explanation of ritual terms, but with the meanings given to many words in the samhita. Though I am far from defending even the greater majority of Sayana's explanations of the more difficult words and sentences of the Samhitét, it would have been at any rate advisable for the compilers of a Sanscrit Dictionary, which includes the Vedic words, to give Sayana's explanations along with their own. Even granted that all Sayana's explanations are only either guesses of his own, or of the great Blatticharyas* before him, whose labours he principally used, they nevertheless deserve all attention as the opinions and observations of men who had a much deeper knowledge of the Sanscrit language in general, and the rites of the Vedic religion, than any European scholar has ever attained to. It is quite erroneous to presuppose, as the editors of the Dictionary appear to do, that Sayana : himself made the majority of explanations in his Commentary. All Pandits who have any knowledge of the subject unanimously assert that he used a good many predecessors, and that comparatively few explana tions are entirely his own. The so-called Kausika Bhagya is said to be more ancient than that of Sâyana, and also the Râvana Bhasya Botha are said to be still extant, but I have not yet been able to obtain copies of them. 

Seeing the great difficulties, nay impossibility, of attaining to any thing like a real understanding of the sacrificial art from all the numerous books I had collected, I made the greatest efforts to obtain oral informa 

* This is the name of those Hindu scholars who not only lcarn, 14 the Bhatlas do, one of the Vedas completoly by heart, but who study the meaning of each vorse and word, so as to bo able to givo orally the explanation of any passage required. The number of this class of scholars who ropresont the Doctors of Hindu theology, ix now very small. In this part of India, though there are many hundreds of parrotliko repeaters of the sacred texts, thero is not a singlo ond to be found. Somo (ilreo or four) aro said to bo at Benares. They are highly respectest, and, as incarnations of Brihaspati.com tho Pandit of the Gods, at cortain occasions regularly worshipped. 

tion from some of those few Brahmans who are known by the name of Srotriyas, or Srautis, and who alone are the preservers of the sacrificial mysteries as they descended from the remotest times. The task was no easy one, and no European scholar in this country before me even suc ceeded in it. This is not to be wondered at; for the proper knowledge of the ritual is everywhere in India now rapidly dying out, and in many parts, chiefly in those under British rule, it has already died out. Besides, the communication of these mysteries to foreigners is regarded by old devout Brâhmans (and they alone have the knowledge) as such a mon strous profanation of their sacred creed, and fraught with the most serious consequences to their position, that they can only, after long efforts, and under payment of very handsome sums, be prevailed upon to give inform ation. Notwithstanding, at length I succeeded in procuring the assistance of a Srauti, who not only had performed the small sacrifices, such as the Darsapůrnamâsa Isti, but who had even officiated as one of the Hotars, or Udgâtars, at several Soma sacrifices, which are now very rarely brought. In order to obtain a thorough understanding of the whole course of an Işti, and a Soma sacrifice, I induced him (about 18 months ago) to show me in some secluded place in my premises, the principal ceremonies. After the place had been properly arranged, and the neces sary implements brought to the spot, the performance began. I noted carefully everything I saw during about five days, and always asked for explanation if I did not properly comprehend it. I was always referred to the Sûtras and the Prayogas or pocket books of the sacrificial priest, 80 that no deception could take place. All information was conveyed to me by means of the Marathi language, of which I had by that time already acquired a sufficient knowledge for carrying on any conversation. In this way I obtained some sort of rough knowledge of the principal ceremonies (for they were generally only partially, in order to save time, and rapidly performed), which I completed afterwards by oral instruction, derived from the same and some other sacrificial priests, and Agnihotris, who had the sacrificial operations performed on themselves and in their behalf. Thus I was enabled to understand the various Sûtras, and consequently the technicalities of the Brâhmaņas. Therefore the explana tions of sacrificial terms, as given in the notes, can be relied upon as certain ; for they are neither guesses of my own, nor of any other Hindu or European scholar, but proceed from what I have myself witnessed, and been taught by the only men who have inherited the knowledge from the most ancient times. My notes are therefore, for the most part, independent of Sâyaņa, for I had almost as good sources as he himselfvi 

had. He, however, does not appear to have troubled bimself much with a minute study of the actual operations of the sacrificial priests, but derived all his knowledge almost entirely from the Sätras only. 

It had been easy for me to swell by accumulation of notes the work to double the size which it is now; but I confined myself to give only what was necessary..........

### INTRODUCTION. 

On the Mantras, Brâhmanas, and Sútras, and their mutual relationship. 

Probable origin and age of the Mantras, and Brâhmanas. 

The Veda, or Scripture of the Brâhmans, consists, according to the opinion of the most eminent divines of Hindustan, of two principal parts, viz., Mantra and Brahmanam. All that is regarded as revelation must be brought under these two heads. What of the revealed word is no Mantra, that is a Brâhmaṇam ; and what is no Brahmanam, must be a Mantra. This is the line of argument followed by the Brâhmanic theologians. But this does neither make clear what a Mantra is, nor what we have to understand by a Brâhmaṇam. Both terms are technical, and their full bearing, and characteristic difference from one another, is to be comprehended only from a careful study of those works which bear either of these titles. The Brâhmanical divines have, of course, not failed to give definitions of both, and shown what topics fall under the head of either. But, as Sayaņa (in his preface to his Comment ary on the Aitareya Brahmaņam) justly remarks, all definitions of either term which were attempted, are unsatisfactory. [2] We have here nothing to do with the theological definitions of these two terms; we are only concerned with their meaning, from a literary point of view. And this we can state without reference to Brâhmanic authorities. 

Each of the four Vedas (Rik, Yajus, Saman, and Atharvan) has a Mantra, as well as a Brahmaņa portion. The difference between both may be briefly stated as follows: That part which contains the sacred prayers, the invocations of the different deities, the sacred verses for chanting at the sacrifices, the sacrificial formulas, blessings and curses, pro nounced by priests is called mantra, 1 i.e., the produce of thinking. This word is of a very early date; for we find it in the Zend-Avesta in the form of manthra also. Its meaning there is that of a sacred prayer, or formula, to which a magical effect was ascribed, 'just as to the Vedic mantras. Zoroaster is called a manthran, i.e., a speaker of mantras, and one of the earliest names of the Scriptures of the Parsis, is manthra śpenta, i.e., the holy prayer (now corrupted to mansar spent). 

* See more about it in Goldstucker, " Pâņini, his Place in Sanscrit Literature," page 68. 

This fact clearly shows, that the term mantra in its proper meaning was already known at that early period of Aryan history when the ancestors of the Brâhmans and those of the Parsis (the ancient Iranians) lived as brother tribes peacefully together. This time was anterior to the combats of [3] the Devas and Asuras, which are so frequently mentioned in the Brâhmaņas, the former representing the Hindus, the latter the Iranians. 

At this time the whole sacred knowledge was, no doubt, comprised by the term mantra. The Brâhmaṇam was unknown; and there is actually nowhere in the whole Zend-Avesta a word to be found which conveys the same or a similar meaning which has been attached to the word " Brahmanam " in the Indian Literature. 

The Brâhmagam always presupposes the Mantra ; for without the latter it would have no meaning, nay, its very existence would be impossible. By " Brâhmaņam" we have always to understand that part of the Veda (Brâhmaņical revelation) which contains speculations on the meaning of the mantras, gives precepts for their application, relates stories of their origin in connection with that of sacrificial rites, and explains the secret meaning of the latter. It is, to say it in short, a kind of primitive theology and philosophy of the Brahmang. The objects for these theological, philosophical, grammatical, etymological, and metrical speculations were the Mantras, and the sacrifices, principally the great ones, for the performance of which the Brabmans were actually trained, a custom which has obtained almost up to the present day in some parts of India (such as Mahârâstra). [4] Etymologically the word is derived from brahmdns which properly 

2 See my Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Roligion of tho Parsis, pp. 225.29. 

$ Brahmán is derived from Brahma. This is an abstract noun, in tho noutor gendor, of a root brih (original from barh), to which the two meanings “ to raiso," and " to grow" are given by the Indian grammarians. The latter thought both meanings so irroc011 cilable that they substituted two roots brin. But there is cortainly no necessity for that. What grows, becomes bigger, and higher and thus “ rising in hoight, is a necessary consequence of growth. It is, however, very doubtful whother the root brin without a proposition (such as ud) can convey the meaning “to raiso." The meaning " to grow" is at any rate the original one. Thus derived Oralma mcang originally “ growth." That this was the original sense of the word, can be provod from other reasons also. Brahma is the same word in every respect, as tho baresma of tho Zend-Avesta, the "h' of Sanscrit, being changed according to tho phonetical laws oL the Zend grammar, into a sibilant. This means a bunch of twigs tiod together by a reed which is used up to the present day by the Parsi priests when porfurming the Homa ceremony. The Brahmans use at all their sacrifices a bunch of lusa grass which is also tied together. They call it Veda (see Asv, sr. S. 1, 11 vedam patnyai prudaya 

- 

signifies the Brahma priest who must (5) know all Vedas, and understand the whole course and meannig of the sacrifice. He is supposed to be a perfect master of divinity, and has in this capacity to direct and superintend the sacrificial ceremonies. The most eminent of this class of priests laid down rules for the proper performance of sacrificial rites, explained them, and defended their own opinions, on such topics against those of their antagonists; moreover, they delighted in specula tions on matters of a more universal character, on this life, and that life, on the best means of securing wealth, progeny, fame, heaven, &c., on mind, soul, salvation, the Supreme Being; the dictum of such a Brahma 

priest who passed as a great authority, was called a Brâhmanam. 

våchayet, i.e., after having handed over to the wife of the sacrificer that bunch of kuta grass which is called Veda, he should make her repeat this mantra, &c). Veda is a synony mous word for brahma; for the latter term is often explained by veda (so does Kaiyata in his notes on Patañjali's explanation of Papini's Sûtra 6, 3, 86, in the Mahâbhâşya), and thus identified with the designation of the whole body of sacred knowledge of the Brahmans. In the Nighantavas, the ancient collection of Vedic words, brahma occurs twice, once as a name for " food" (2, 7), and another time as that for " wealth." Both these meanings, principally the former, can easily be connected with that of “growta" They appear to be founded on passages of the Brahmanas, where it is said that the Brahma is food. In the Samhítâ, however, these meanings are never to be met with ; but from this circumstance it certainly does not follow that they never existed. The meaning attached to the word in the Sanhits appears to be that of " sacred hymon chant." Sayana explains it often by stotra, i.e. the performance of the Sâma chanters (see his commentary on Rigveda, 7, 22, 9) or by stotráni haviņşicha (7, 23, 1), i.e. chants and offerings. This meaning is, however, not the original one, and does even in the Samhitâ hardly express, its proper sense. It cannot be an equivalent either for mantra or sámun or stotram, or havis, and if it appear to be used in one of these senses, it means their courmon gource; for the hymn, repeated by the Hotar, as well as the chant of the Sama singers and the obla. tions given to the fire by the Adhvaryu, are all equally made sacred by means of their participation in the bralima. Such expressions as, “ to make the brahma," "to stir up the brahma," (brahma jinvatt) throw some light on its nature. They show (as one may clearly see from such passages as Taittirîya Brahmanam 1, 1), that it was regarded as a laten power, like electricity, whicb was to be stirred up at the time of the performance of a ceromony. The apparatus were the sacred vessels, or the hymns, or chants. So, at a certain ceremony at the morning libation of tho Soma feast, the Adhvaryi and Prati pasthätår put the two Grabas (Soma cups), called Sukra and Manthi (see Ait. Br. 3, 1') together, and address them in the following way,“ Put, yo two (Grabas) ! together the Brahwa; may ye stir it up for me," &c., (Taittir. Br. 1, 1). This evidently means, that these two Grahas are put together for the purpose of eliciting the Brahma-power, and all the other powers, dependent upon it, such as the Kşattram, &c. The presence of the brukma at every sacrifice is necessary; for it is the invisible 11uk connecting the cere mony performed with the fruits wished for, such as sovereignty, leadership, cattle, food, &c. 

It is, as we have seen, symbolically represented by a bunch of kusa grass, which is always wandering from one person to another, as long as the sacrifice lasts. It expresses 

ped 

[6] Strictly speaking, only the rule regarding the performance of a parti cular rite, * or the authoritative opinion on a certain point of speculative theology went by this name, and we have accordingly in the works called Brahmaņas, nothing more or less than collections of the dicta of those Brahma priests on the topics mentioned. Afterwards the term Brahmanam, which originally signified only a single dictum, was applied to the whole collection. 

In a still more comprehensive sense we have to understand by " Brahmaņa," a whole kind of literature, including the so-called Aranyakas and Upanişads, 

· Each Veda has a Brahmaṇam, or collectiou of the dicta of Brahma priests, of its own. But they also show in style, expression, line of argų ment, and object and tendency of their speculations, such a close affinity, and even identity, that the common origin of all Brahmanas is indisputable. They owe mainly their origin to those Brahmans who constituted them selves into regular sacrificial congregations, in order to perform the so-called Sattras or sacrificial sessions, some of which could last for many years. The legendary history of India knows of such sessions which are said to have lasted for one hundred, and even one thousand years. Though these reports [7] are extravagant, they undoubtedly show that there was a time in Ilin. dustan when large bodies of Brahmans spent almost their whole lives in sacrificing. This time is to be sought for at a very early period of Inilian history ; for the Brâhmaņas with their frequent allusions and references to the Sattras of the Kişis on the banks of the Sarasvati, and those hold by the half-mythical Angiras, and by the Adityas (a class of gods), or even by the cows, trees, snakes, &c., presuppose their existence from times immemorial. Likewise we find in the Mahabharata frequent mention made of these sacrificial sessions which constitute one of the characteristic foa tures of the earliest Brahmanic settlements in the northwest of Ilindustan. It is chiefly at these Sattras that we have to look for the development and refinement of the sacrificial art, and the establishment of certain rules regarding the performance of sacrificial ceremonies.

the productive power in nature, which manifests itself in tho growth of plants, and all other creatures. The sacrificer wishes by means of the mystical process of tho sacrifice to get hold of it; for only then he is sure of obtaining anything he might wish for. 

4 So are, for instance, the rules given for the repetition of tho Dirotlaram (4, 10) quoted as a “ Brahmaṇam" (in 6, 25). See also 8, 2.

When the Brâhmaņas were brought into that form, in which we possess them now, not only the whole kalpa (i.e. the way of performing the sacrificial ceremonies) was settled, save some minor points, but even the symbolical and mystical meaning of the majority of rites. It took, no doubt, many centuries before the almost endless number of rites and cerem monies, and their bewildering complications could form themselves into such a regular system of sacrificial rules, as we find already exhibited in the Brâhmaņas. For the Sûtras which belong to each class of Brâhmanas generally contain nothing novel, (8) no innovation in the sacrificial art; they supply only the external form to a system which is already complete in the Brâhmaņas, and serve as text-books to the sacrificial priests. And even in their arrangement they follow often their Brâhmaņas to which they be long. So for instance the fourth, fifth, and sixth Adhyayas of the Asvala yana Sûtras, which treat of the Agniştoma, Soma sacrifice, and its modi fications, Ukthya, şolaši, and Atirâtra, closely correspond to the three first books, and the two first chapters of the fourth, of the Aitareya Brâhmaṇam ; and the seventh and eighth Adhyâya of those Sûtras treat exactly of the same subjects, as the three last chapters of the fourth book, and the fifth and sixth books of our Brâhmaṇam, viz., on the various parts of the Sattras, or sacrificial sessions, and the numerous recitations required for their performance. In many passages, the Aitareya Brâb ,maņam and the Asvalâyana Sutras even literally agree. The latter could, 

from their very nature as a “ string of rules" for the guidance of the sacrificial priests, dispense with almost all the numerous speculations of the meaning and effect of certain verses and rites, and all points of contro versy in which some of the Brâhmaņas abound; but as regards the actual performance of rites, what mantras were required at certain occasions, and in what way they were to be repeated, the Satras must give much more detail and be far more complete than the Brâhmaņas. From this nature of both classes of works, and the relation in which they stand to one [9] another, it would not be difficult to show, that both might have ori ginated at the same time. Pâņini distinguishes between old and new Brâhmaņas as well as between old and new Kalpa works (8ûtras). The strict distinction between a Brâhmaņa and Sûtra period is, on a closer inquiry, hardly tenable. The Brâhmaņas were only more complete col lections of the same traditional stock which was in existence on the sacrificial art and its meaning than the Sûtras, which were compiled for practical purposes only. 

We may safely conclude from the complicated nature and the multitude of the Brahminical sacrifices which were already developed 

xiv 

and almost complete at the time of the composition of the Vedic frymas, not only at that of the Brahmaņas, that the compilation of sacrificial manuals containing all the rules for the actual performance of the duties of a certain class of priests (such as the Hotris or repeaters of the Rik verses, the Udgâtris, the chanters of the Rik verses, and the Adhvaryus, the manual labourers and sacred cooks), was quite necessary at a very early time, certainly not posterior to the collection of the Mantras and the dicta of the Brahma priests into separate works. 

The Sûtras contain many special rules which will be in vain sought for in the Brâhmaņas, but which are there simply presupposed. So we do not find, for instance, the description of the Daráapurnama isthi (the New and Full Moon sacrifice), or that of the Chfiturmäsya-isti, in the Aitareya Brâhmanam, though their names are occasionally mentioned, but [10] we find them in the Asvalagana Sūtras. The recital of the Samidhent verses (required when kindling the fire at the coinmencement of any sac rificial rite) is briefly mentioned in the Brahmanas, but minutely described in the Sûtras (1, 2). That they were left out in tho Brahmanam cannot be accounted for by assuming that their exposition was alien to the purpose of its author, or that they were unknown to him, but only by believing, that they were regarded as too trivial matters, too commonly known to deserve any special notice on his part. Certain modifications in repeating mantras (required at the great Soma sacri fices), such as the Dürohanam, the Nyrtilha, the peculiar construction and repetition of the Solasi and Vúllahılya Sastras, «c., are in the Brahmanam almost as minutely and accurately describol, as we find them in the Sûtras (compare, for instance, Ait. Br. 4, 19. with Asv. Sr. S. 8,2). This clearly shows that the authors of the Brålumanas know as well all the details of the sacrificial art as the compilers of the Sûtras. The circumstance that many such things, as the recital of the Sâmidheni verses, &c., were left out in the Brahmanam, though they are neither very simple to comprehend, nor were they unknown, entities us to assume that they were taught in separate treatises, whiel could be nothing else than works like the present Sätras. 

The Sætras wbich we possess at present are, no doubt, postorior to the Brâhmanas to which they belong; but there is every reason to believe that there were Sûtras more ancient, and simple in their [11] style, which served the authors of the present ones as sources of information, and these works may have been co-eval with the majority of our Bralımaņas. 

Although we cannot discover any inaterial difference betwoen the Brühmaṇas and the Satras so as to regard the latter as duroloping and 

systematizing the ideas contained in the former, as is the case with the Vedanta philosophy in reference to the Upanişads, yet there exists one between the Brâhmaņas, and the Mantras and hymns. This difference is, however, not very great, and can be accounted for partially from other causes than that of age. Alieady the lymns presuppose a settled ritual, and contain many speculative ideas similar to those of the Brâhmaņas. 

Some scholars hold that the occurrence of sacrificial terms, or of philosophical and mystical ideas, are suggestive of the late date of the hymn in which they are found. But these circumstances do by Do means afford any sure test as to the relative age of the Vedic hymns. One has even drawn a strict line of distinction between a Mantra and Chbandas period, assigning to the former all the sacrificial hymns, to the latter those expressive of religious and devotional feelings in general, without any reference to sacrificial rites. But I have grave doubts whether this distinction will prove tenable on further inquiries, chiefly if this question as to the age of a certain hymn is made entirely to depend upon what period (the Mantra or Chhandas period) it might belong to. There are sacrificial hymns which, to judge from their style and their general ideas, must (12) be as ancient as any which have been assigned to the Chhandas period. 

I may instance here the hymn required at the horse-sacrifice (Rigveda, 1, 162) and the Nabhanediştha Sûkta (10, 61 ; on its origin see Ait. Br. 5, 14). The former is assigned by Max Müller to the Mantra period (between 1000-800) on no other ground but because of its containing technical terms of the sacrificial art. But this reason is certainly not sufficient to make it late. On the contrary, its rather unpolished style, its poor imagery, its beginning with the invocation of the most ancient triad of Indian gods, Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman, the very names of which deities are even to be met with in kindred nations, such as the Iranians and Greeks, the mentioning of several sacrificial priests by obsolete and uncommon names,--all these circum stances combined tend to show, that it is rather one of the earliest than one of the latest productions of Vedic poetry. We find in it the sacrificial art, if compared with its description in the Brâmaņas, in its infancy, yet containing all the germs of the latter system. Because of almost all incidents attendant upon a sacrifice being mentioned in this hyman, it: affords us the best means for investigating into the extent 

• History of Ancient Sanscrit Literature, page 553,xvi 

and development of the sacrificial art at the time of its composition. Let us point out some of the most remarkable facts which may be elicited from it. [13] In the fifth verse the names of the performing priests are mentioned. They are only six in number, viz. Hotar, Adhvaryu, Avayâj, Agnimindha, Gravagrabha, and Samstar. Four of these names are quite uncommon or obsolete. Avayâj is the Pratiprasthậtar, Agnimindha (the fire-kindler), the Agnídhra, Gråvagrâbha the Grâvastut, and Samstar the Maiträvaruna of the Brâhmanas. The small number of priests at the horse-sacrifice (aśvamedha), which was at later times, as we may learn from descriptions given of it in the epic poems, the greatest, most complicated and costly which the Brahmans used to perform, must surprise, principally if we consider, that the Agniştoma, which was the most simple Soma sacrifice, required for its performance already at the time of the Brâhmanas, and even anterior to it, sixteen officiating priests. 

There can be no doubt that in the most ancient times a comparatively small number of priests was sufficient for the performance of a simplo animal or Soma sacrifice. The two most ancient offices were those of the Hotar and Adhvaryu; they were known already when the ancient Iranians separated from the ancestors of the Hindus; for we easily recognise them by the names Zota and Rathwi (now corrupted to Raspi) in the Zend Avesta. 

The Pratiprasthậtar appears to have been an assistant of the Add varyu from a very remote time; for we find the two Asvins called the two Adhvaryus (Ait. Br. 1, 18), by which expression we can only under stand the Adhvaryu and [14] his constant assistant the Pratiprasthitar, That there was a plurality of Adhvaryus already at the time of tho Rişis, we may learn from several passages of the Samhitî of the Rigveda (2, 37, 2; 8, 2, 4). 

The fourth priest here mentioned is the Agnidhra ; for by the term Agnimindha we can only understand him. His office appears to be very old and he is once mentioned by his very name Agnidhra in a Vedic song (2, 36, 4). Besides, we meet with the well-known formula which he has, as the protector of the sacrifice, to repeat as often as the Adllvaryu commences a set of oblations accompanied by the Anuvákyâ and Yûjya mantras of the Hotar. This is astu þrauşat (1, 139, 1), which he has to repeat when the Adhvaryu calls upon him to do so, by the formula ô śrâvaya." Before he repeats it, he takes a wooden sword, called 

. This formula is repeated just before the commencomcnt of the so-called Prnyijas, Asval. śr, S1, 4, gives the following rules; Adhvaryur ásravayati pratyášrcivayad

rway. 

sphya' into his hand, and ties round it twelve stalks of kusa grass, called idhmasannahanani (what is tied round the wood), making three knots (trisandhana). He must hold it up as long as the principal offerings last, from (15) the time of the beginning of the Prayajas till the Sviştakrit is over. The purpose of this act as explained by the Srotriyas (sacrificial priests) of the present day is to keep the Rakşasas and evil spirits away from the sacrifice. Now the whole ceremony, along with the formulas used, resembles so closely what is recorded in the Zend-Avesta of the angel Sraosha (now called Seroşh), that we can fairly conclude that the office, or at any rate, the duties, of the Agnidhra priests were already known to the Aryas before the Iranians separated from the Indians. Serosh, as may be seen from the Serosh Yasht (Yasna 57), holds in his hand a sword (śnaithis) in order to fight against the Devas, and to keep them away from the creation of Ormazd. He first spread the sacred grass or twigs; he first repeated (fraśravayat) the sacred prayers. His very name of Sravsha reminds of the call śrauşat. One of the duties of the Agnîdhra, or Agrît, was to kindle the fire. Such an office is known also to the Parsi ritual. It is that of the Atarevakso, i. e. who feeds the fire, a name often applied to the Rathwi, in which we have recognised the Adhvaryu. 

The fifth priest is the Gråragrâbha, a name no further mentioned in other Vedic books. Sâyaņa identifies him with the Gråvastute of the ceremonial of the Brâhmaņas. The office of the latter is to repeat the Pavamânya verses when the Soma juice is being prepared. But the name Grâvagrabha (18) implies more, for it means, one who holds, or seizes the Grâvaņas?" (Soma squeezing stones). This is done by the Adhvarya himself. In ancient times the Soma juice was very likely extracted by that priest who had to repeat the mantras for the purification of the Soma juice, that is, by the Grâvastut. Such a priest who was engaged in the preparation of the Soma (Homa) juice is also known in the Zend-Avesta. 

ågnidhrah, i. e. the Adhvaryu calls, ö śrävaya, to which the Agnidhra responds by astu śrausat. Both formulas are mentioned or alluded to in two Satras of Panini (8, 2, 91-92), who teaches that the first vowel in śráuşat, and the first and second in ö śravaya are to le pronounced in the pluta way, i.e. with three moras. Regarding śrâuşaç Ašval. gives the same' rale (astu śrâuşaţ iti aukarum plávayan); but the pronunciation of ö śråvaya he does not particularly mention. 

* Other interpretations have been given of this word by European scholars. But being: myself in possession of a sphya, and baving seen its use at the sacrifce, I can prove beyond any doubt, that it is a wooden sword. 

* On his office, see 6, 1-2, pp. 379-80. 10 See the note on the preparation of the Soma 7, 32 pp. 488-90.

His name there is havanan, 11 4.6. one who makes or prepares the havana=savana" libatior." 

The sixth priest mentioned in the Asvamedha hymn is the Samstar, 2.e. the repeater of Sastras. This is no doubt the Maitrâvaruna of the later ritual, who is several times mentioned by the name of Prašâstar in other passages of the Samhita (1, 94,6) and in the Brahmanas. Sayaņa takes the same viev. 

Besides the names of the officiating priests, we have to examine some of the technical terms of the sacrificial art. In the 15th verso we find (17] the expressions, iştam, vitam, abhigurtam, vaşatkritam, which all refer to the repetition of the Yâjya mantra by the Hotar when the Adhvaryu is ready to throw the offering into the fire. Istam is the technical term for 

pronouncing the Yâjyâ mantra itself; athigârtam, which is the same as 

· âgúrtam, signifies the formula ye yajámahe (generally called âgur) which 

always precedes the Yâjyâ verse; vaşatkritam is the pronunciation of the formula vâuşat at the end of the Yâjyâ verse; vitam refers to the formula Agne yihi, which follows the pagatkara, and is itself followed by another vaşatkâra (the so-called Anuvaşıkára) 

Let us now sum up the evidence furnished by this sacrificial hymn as bearing upon the history of the sacrificial art in its relationship to the mass of other Vedic songs on the one, and to the Brâhmaņas on the other, side. 

In examining the names of the officiating priests, we can here dis cover only two classes instead of the four, known to other Vedic hymns, and principally to the Brâhmaņas. We have only Adhvaryus and Hotris, but no Brahma priests, and no Udgâtris (chanters). Without the two latter classes no solemn sacrifice at which Soma was used could be per formed oven at a time far anterior to the Brahmaņas. There is no doubt, the introduction of each of these two classes marks a new, epoch in the history of the sacrificial art, just as the separation of the offices of Adh 

11 See Višparad 3,1, The term havana occars in tho Gathås for Homa (Yasnih, 10). That it means the same as the Vedic savana with which it is identical follows aquistal ably from the context. A fratarem havanem and an aparem. lavanem, that is a first and second libation, are even distinguished. (Yasna 10, 2, ed. Westergaard). The matarem havanem is the pratah savanam, że morning libation of the ritual books; the uparem in latter, following, corresponds to the mådhyandino savanam. Tho Parsi priests prepare up to the present day actually the Homa juice twice when performing tho Homa ceremony. The first preparation takes place before the Zota (tho Hotar of the Brahmans) appears; the second commences at the beginning of the proper ceromony, and is finished along with it. The Zota drinks the Howa which was prepared first by the Raspi (Adlvaryu); that one prepared during the ceremony is thrown into a well as a kind of otlaring 

is 

varyu and Hotar in the ante-Vedio times, indicates the first step in the development of the art of sacrificing. At that early time when the (18] Iranians left their Indian brethren' on account of a bitter religious contest, which is known in the Brâhmaṇas as the struggle between the Devas and Asuras; already the offices of an Adhvaryu and Hotar were distinct, as we may learn from the Zend-Avesta, which exhibits the religion of the Asuras (Ahura religion, its professors calling themselves ühurotkéskô=asura-dikşå, i.e. initiated into the Asura rites). 

But the offices of Udgåtris and that of the Brahma priests were not known to the Aryas at that time; they were introduced subsequently, after the separation. In many Vedic hymns we find, however, the duties principally of the former class (the chanters) mentioned. They are often juxtaposed with those of the Hotars. The term for the perform ance of the Hotri-priests is saris, to praise, recite; that for that of the Udgâtris stų or gái to sing (see, for instance, Rigveda Samh (8, 1, 1; 6, 62, 5; 6, 69, 2-3); besides the technical names uktha=Sastra and Stoma, sama, are frequently to be met with (see 8, 1, 15; 3, 3,6; 6,3; 16,9; 14, 11 ; 6, 24, 7, &c.). Now the absence of all such terms, indica tory of the functions of the Udgâtris (chanters) in the Afvamedha hymn is certainly remarkable. Their not occuring might, perhaps, be accounted for by the supposition that the chanters were not required at the horse sacrifice. It is true, several smaller sacrifices, such as the Darsapûrna. måsa, the Ohâturmâsya Iştis and the animal sacrifice (if performed apart without forming part of a Soma sacrifice) are performed without any chanting; [19] but for Soma sacrifices of whatever description, the chanters are as indispensable as the Hotars. That the Ašvamedha was connected with a Soma sacrifice?* already at the time of the composition of the hymn in question, undoubtedly follows from the office of Grâvagrábha being mentioned in it; for this priest is only required for the extracting of the Soma juice, and has nothing whatever to do with any other sacrificial rite. The mentioning of the Sanstar (Maitråvruņa) is another indication that the Afvamedha already at that early time was accompanied by a Soma sacrifice. For one of the principal duties of the Maitråvaruņa, who may be called the first assistant of the Hotar, is to repeat Sastras, which are only required at Soma sacrifices as the necessary accompaniments of all chants. 

Besides the Udgå fris, we miss the class of the Brahma priests, viz. Brahmâ, Brâhmanâchansi, and Subrahmanya, whose services are required 

13 According to Asval, át. 8otras (10, 8) there are three Soma days (sutyanis required for the horse sacrifice. 

. 

at all great sacrifices. The Brahmå cannot, even at small sacrifices, such as the Darsapûrņamâsa Işti, be dispensed with. The Brahmana chansi aud Subrahmanya are at Soma sacrifices as indispensable as the Maitrâvaruna; the first has to repeat also Sastras for the chants, the latter to invite every day Indra to the Soma feast (see the note to 6, 3, pp. 382-84). 

The introduction of the Brahmâ priest marks• no doubt a new era in the history of the sacrificial art; [20] for to judge from the nature of his duties as superintendent of the sacrifical ceremonies, he was only necessary at a time when the sacrifice had become already very complicated, and was liable to many mistakes. The origin of the office dates earlier than the Brâhmaņas. Unmistakeable traces of it are to be found already in the Samhita of the Rigveda. In one passage 1, 10, 1, the Bralımi priests (brahmanas) are juxtaposed with the Hotris (arkina?) and Urigatris (guyat rinah). They are there said to "raise Indra just as (one raises) a reed." Similarly we find together gayata, chant, samsata, praise, and brahma krinuta make the Brahma (8, 32, 17). In 10, 91, 10 the Brahmi is mon tioned along with other priests also, such as the Potar, Neştar, &c. Tho little work done by the Brahmâ priests, or rather their idleness, is men tioned, 8, 92, 30," do not be as lazy as a Brahma priest" (mo șrı trah meva tandrayur bhuvah). That the Brahmâ priests were thus reproached may clearly be seen from Ait. Brâhm. 5, 34. The Brahmå priest is the speaker or éxpounder of religious matters (10, 71, 11; 117, 8), -in which capacity they became the authors of the Bralımanas. That the Brahmâ was expected to know all secret things, may bo inferred from several passages (10, 85, 3; 16; 35; 36). Brihaspati, the teacher of the gods, is also called brahmd (10, 143, 3), and Agni is honoured with tho same name (7,7,5), as well as his pious worshippers of old, the so-called Angirasah (7, 42, 1). Sometimes the name signifies the Brahman as distinguished from the Kşattriyas brahmani rajani va (1, 108, 7). [21] It is certainly remarkable, that none of the Brahmii priests is to be found among the priests enumerated in the Agvamedha liyinn, and we may safely conclude, that their offices were not known at that time. The word brahma (neuter) itself occurs in it (in the seventeenth verno), "If any one, in order to make thee sit, did thee harm by kicking theo with his heels, or striking thee with a whip violently so that thou didst snort, I cause all to go off from thee by means of the Brałıma, just as I make flow (the drops of melted butter) by means of a Sruch (sacrificial spoon) over the piece which is among the ready-made oficrings (adlı vareşu). Brahma has here very likely its original meaning, “ the sacrificial grass 

Ixi 

or a certain bunch of it (see the note on pages 4, 5 of this Introduction), For the meaning " prayer," which is here given to it by Sâyana, does not suit the simile. In order to understand it fully, one has to bear in mind that the Adhvaryu after having cooked and made ready any offering (Purodása or flesh, or Charu, &c.) generally pours from a Sruch some drops of melted butter over it. Now the brahma by means of which the priest is to soothe all injury which the sacrificial horse may have received from kicking or striking, is compared with this Sruch; the drops of melted butter are then the several stalks of the bunch of the sacrificial grass, required at all sacrifices and their taking out, and throwing away (as is done at all sacrifices, see note 8 to page 79), is compared to the flowing of the drops from the sacrificial spoon. 

Not only is the number of priests less, but the [22] ceremonies are also more simple. It appears from verse 15th, that there was no Puronuvâkyêu or introductory mantra required, but the Yajyâ alone was sufficient. The latter consisted already of the same parts as in the Brâhmaņas, viz. the Agur, the Yajyâ mantra, the Vaşatkâra and Anuvaşatkâra (see note 32 to page 95, page 126, and note 11 to page 133-34). The Agur or the introductory formula, ye yajâmahe, i e., “what (gods are), those we worship by sacrificing," is very ancient, and seems to go back even beyond the properly so-called Vedic times ; for we meet it even with the same name already in the Zend-Avesta (see note 11 to page 134); even a large number of the Parsi prayer formulas commence with it up to this day, viz. yuzámaide. The Vaşaçkâra or the call văuşat, and the Anuvaşatkâra, or the second call vâuşať preceded by Agni rihi, i.e., "Agni eat (the food)," must be also very old, though we do not find any trace of them in the Parsi ritual, which circumstance can be, however, easily accounted for. The first call váuşat being required in the very moment of the offering being thrown into the fire, and the second at once after it, there was no occasion for them at the Zoroastrian sacrifices; for the priests are not allowed to throw flesh, or Homa, or even cakes into the fire; they have only to show their offerings to the sacred element. In the Samhita itself, the Vaşatkâra is frequently mentioned, and in hymns which show by no means a modern origin (see 1, 14, 8; 120, 4; 21,5; 7, 14, 3; 15, 6;99, 7, &c); some of them appar ently allude to the [23] Anuvaşatkâra, (so, for instance, 7, 156, semám vetu vaşatkritim, 'may he eat this piece' offered by the call vauşat! vi (in vihi) being one of the characteristic terms of the Anuvaşatára). 

From all we have seen as yet it clearly follows that the Ašvamedha hymn is by no means a late, but a very early, production of Vedic poetry, 

xti 

and that consequently a strict distinction between a Chbandas and Mantra period, making the former by about two hundred years older than the latter, is hardly admissible. 

The same result is to be gained from a more cloge examination of other pre-eminetly sacrificial hymns, which all would fall under the Mantra period. There being here no occasion to investigate into all hymns of that character, I will only here make some remarks on the Nâbhânediştha hymns (10, 61-62). Their history is given in the Ait. Brâhm. itself (5, 14). They are traced to Manu, the progenitor of the human race, who gave them to his son, Nabhanedişgha. He should communicate them to the Angiras, for enabling them to perform success fully the ceremonies of the sixth day (in the Şalaha, (see note 9 to page 279), and receive all their property as a sacrificial reward. 

This whole story appears to have no other foundation, 1but the two hymns themselves, principally the [241 latter. The first is very difficult to understand, the second is on the the whole simple. Both are by tradition ascribed to Nâbhânediştha, the son of Manu, whose existence is very doubtful. They differ so much in style, that they cannont have the same author. Several traits of the legend, however, are to be found in them. The refrain of the first four verses of 10, 62 which is addressed to the Angiras, "receive the son of Manu," re-occurs in the legend ; also the gift of a thousand. In a verse of the former (10, 61, 18) the word nábhanediştha occurs, but it does not mean there a human, but somo divine, being. I give the 18th and 19th verses in translation. 

(18) "His relative, the wealthy Nabhånediştha who, directing his thoughts towards thee, speaks on looking forward (as follows) 'this our navel is the highest; as often as required I was behind bin (the Nâbhânedistha on earth). " 

(19) “This is my pavel, bere is what resides with me, thene gods are mine; I am everything. Those who are first born, and those who are born for a second time (by reproduetion),--the cow milked that (seed) from the truth, (and) they are born." ** 

15 It is to be found also with little difference in the Taittiriya Samhita 8, 1, 0, 4-6. Instead of the two Saktas (hymus) Mana there is said to have given his son « Brihmanan on a certain rite concerning the share of Radra in the Boma libation, to help the Angiras to heaven. The " sixth day" is not mentioned in it. The man in a "blackish dress" of the Aitareya Br, is here called Rudra. 

1* The explanation given by Sayaņa of these difficult verses is vory artificial. He tries to get out of the kyun everywhere the story told of Nabhanedin tha in the Aite Br. 5, 14. 

From these two verses as well as from several others in it (princi pally 2 and 5-8 describing Prajapati's illicit intercourse with his [25] daughter, see Ait. Br. 3, 33), we may clearly perceive that Nâbhâne diştha and the hymn in question refer to generation. This view is fully eorroborated by the application of it at the sacrifice, as expounded by the Brâhmaṇam, and as even pre-supposed in the hymn itself. 

We know from various passages of the Brâhmaņas, that one of the principal acts of the sacrificial priests was to make a new body to the sacrificer, and produce him anew by mantras, and various rites, by making him mystically undergo the same process to which he owed his natural life. So, for instance, the whole Pravargya ceremony (see note 1 to pages 41-43), the Ajya and Pra-uga Sastras (see Ait. Br. 2, 35-38; 3, 2) of the morning libation, and the so-called Silpa Sastras (6, 27-31) of the Hotri-priests are intended for this purpose. Of the latter the two Nâbhânediştha hymns form the two first parts, representing the seed effused, and its transformation to an embryo in its rudest state (see 6, 27). Nâbhânediştha is the sperm when effused ; after having undergone some change in the womb, it is called Narasamsa.16 That the hyma originally had such a mystical sense, is evident from the two first verses: [26] (1) "May this awful Brabma, which he (Prajapati) thus skilfully pronounced in words at the congregation, at the assembly, fill the seven Hotars on the day of cooking (the sacrificial food), when his (the sarificer's) parents (and other) liberal men (the priests) are making (his body).". 

(2) "He established (as place) for the reception of his gift the altar (vedi), destroying, and ejecting the enemy with his weapons. After having thus made the place safe) he then hastily under a very loud cry poured forth hiş sperm in one continuous (stream).” 

The meaning of these two verses can only be the following: the poet who was no doubt a; sacrificial priest himself wishes, that the hymn which be regards as, a revelation from Prajâ pati, who repeated it at the great sacrificial session which he is so frequently said to have held, may fill the seven Hotri-priests when they, with the same liberality as Prajapati 

14-This idea must be very old; for we find an unmistakeable trace of it in the Zoroastrian tradition. So we read in the Bundehesh (page 80 in Westergaard's edition of the Pehlevi text) that the angel Nerioseng (nerioseng yazd=narasamhsa yajata in Sanscrit) intercepted the three particles of sperm which Zoroaster is said to have once lost, and out of which the three great prophets, Oshadar (båmi), Oshadar máh, and Sosiosh are expected to spring at the end of the world. Norioseng clothed the said sperms with lustre and strength (rosnus Zor), and handed them over to Andhit (the Persian Venus) to look at them. They are guarded against the attacks. of the Devas (the Indian gods) by 999,999 Probarg (a kind of angels).

(when he poured forth his sperm) are like parents making by their hymns the new celestial body to the sacrificer. The place for reception uf the seed poured out mystically in prayer by the IIotars, is the altar; for standing near it (and even touching it with their feet) they repeat the mantras. The reason that they have to regard the Vedi as the safe receptacle of the seed, is to be sought for in the antecedent of I'rajinati, who prepared it for the purpose, defending [27] it against the attacks of enemies. After having made it safe, he poured out his soed vlenco then all creatures sprang (see Ait. Br. 3, 34). 

Nabhânediştha is, according to the verses above quoted, the heavenly guardian of all germs of generation ; all gods, men, boasts, &c., come from him. His assistance is required when the sacrificial priests are producing the new celestial body of the sacrificer. He looks down from heaven at his relative, that is, the seeds containing tho germ of new life poured out mystically by the lotars in their prayers. Ilis navel is the centre of all births in the universe ; as being nearest (* nearest to the pavel' is the literal meaning of náthân tiştha), he is the guardian of all seeds. Every seed on earth has only effect as far as ko participates in it. We have here the Zoroastrian idea of the Fravashis (Frohars) who aro the prototypes of all things existing. The word nâbhânediştha munt lo very old; for we find it several times in the form nabånaedlisti in the Zend Avesta. It is an epithet of the Fravashis (Yasna, 1, 18. Yashtu 13, 156), and signifies the lineal descendants in future generations't (Vend. 4, 5-10 Westergaard). 

[28] Although the Nábbånediştha hymn (10, 61) is purely wrisirial, and composed at a time when the Rişis already indulged in speculations on the mystical meaning of sacrificial rites, no trace can be found, to whole that it is a modern composition. The circumstance, that it is already in the Aitareya Brahmanam traced to Manu, the progenitor of the human race, shows, that its origin is entirely lost in the depths of antiquity. The mentioning of Kaleşivan in verso 16, and the occurrence of tho “seven Hotars" (in the 1st verse) are no proofs of a late origin, For

sphyas into his hand, and ties round it twelve stalks of kusa grass, called idhmasannahandni (what is tied round the wood), making three knots (trisandhana). He must hold it up as long as the principal offerings last, from (15) the time of the beginning of the Prayájas till the Sviştakrit is over. The purpose of this act as explained by the Srotriyas (sacrificial priests) of the present day is to keep the Rakşasas and evil spirits away from the sacrifice. Now the whole ceremony, along with the formulas used, resembles so closely what is recorded in the Zend-Avesta of the angel Sraosha (now called Seroşh), that we can fairly conclude that the office, or at any rate, the duties, of the Agnidhra priests were already known to the Aryas before the Iranians separated from the Indians. Serosh, as may be seen from the Serosh Yasht (Yasna 57), holds in his hand a sword (śnaithis) in order to fight against the Devas, and to keep then away from the creation of Ormazd. He first spread the sacred grass or twigs; he first repeated fraśrâvayat) the sacred prayers. His very name of Sraosha reminds of the call śrausat. One of the duties of the Agnidhra, or Agrît, was to kindle the fire. Such an office is known also to the Parsi ritual. It is that of the Atarevakso, 2. e. fyho feeds the fire, a name often applied to the Rathwi, in which we have recognised the Adhvaryu. 

The fifth priest is the Grdragrâbha, a name no further mentioned in other Vedic books. Sâyaņa identifies him with the Grâvastut® of the ceremonial of the Brâhmaņas. The office of the latter is to repeat the Pavamânya verses when the Soma juice is being prepared. But the Dame Grävagrabha (16) implies more, for it means, one who holds, or seizes the Grâvaņası(Soma squeezing stones). This is done by the Adhvaryu himself. In ancient times the Soma juice was very likely extracted by that priest who had to repeat the mantras for the purification of the Soma juice, that is, by the Grâvastut. Such a priest who was engaged in the preparation of the Soma (Homa) juice is also known in the Zend-Avesta.

Both formulas are mentioned or alluded to in two Satras of Panini (8, 2, 91-92), who teaches that the first vowel in śráusat, and the first and second in o śravaya are to be pronounced in the pluta way, i.e. with three moras. Regarding sráuşat Asya), gives the same rule (astu śrâuşat iti aukaram plâvayan); but the pronunciation of o śråvaya he does not particularly mention.

His name there is havanan,"1 i.e. one who makes or prepares the havana=savana “ libatior." 

The sixth priest mentioned in the Advamedha hymn is the Sanstar, i.e, the repeater of Sastras. This is no doubt the Maiträvaruņa of the later ritual, who is several times mentioned by the name of Prašâstar in other passages of the Samhita (1,94, 6) and in the Brâhmaņas. Sayana takes the same viepy. 

Besides the names of the officiating priests; we have to examine some of the technical terms of the sacrificial art. In the 15th verse we find [17] the expressions, iştan vitam, abhigúrtam, vaşatkritam, which all refer to the repetition of the Yajya mantra by the Hotar when the Adhvaryu is ready to throw the offering into the fire. Iştam is the technical term for pronouncing the Yâjyâ mantra itself; abhigârtamin which is the same as âgúrtam, signifies the formula ye yajamahe (generally called âgur) which always precedes the Yâjyâ verse; vaşatkritan is the pronunciation of the formula vâuşat at the end of the Yâjyâ verse; vitam refers to the formula Agne vihi, which follows the vaşatkâra, and is itself followed by another vaşatkâra (the so-called Anuvaştkâra). 

Let us now sum up the evidence furnished by this sacrificial hymn aş bearing upon the history of the sacrificial art in its relationship to the mass of other Vedic songs on the one, and to the Brabmanas on tho other: side. 

In examining the names of the officiating prieste, we can here dis cover only two classes instead of the four, known to other Vedic hymns, and principally to the Brahmaņas. We have only Adhvaryus and Llotris, but no Brahma priests, and no Udgâtris (chapters). Without tho two latter classes no solemn sacrifice at which Soma was used could be per formed even at a time far anterior to the Brahmaņas. There is no doubt, the introduction of each of these two classes marks a new epoch in the history of the sacrificial art, just as the separation of the offices of Adh 

Why 

11 See Visparad 3,1. The term havana occurs in the Gathes for Homa (Yašna, 10). That it means the same as the Vedic aavana with which it is identical follows anmistak ably from the context. A fratarem haganem and an uparen havanem, that is, a first and second libation, are even distinguished (Yasna 10, 2 ed. Westerganrd). Tbo tratarem havanem is the prātaḥ savanam, i.e. morning libation of the ritual books; tho uparim, latter, following,. corresponds to the mådhyandino savanam. The Parsi priesto preparo up to the present day actually the Iloma juice twice when perforining the Homa coromony. The first preparation takes place before the Zota (the Hotar of the Brahmans) appears; the second commences at the beginning of the proper ceremony, and is finished along with it. The Zota drinks the Howa which was prepared first by the Raspi (Adhvaryu); that one prepared during the ceremony is thrown into a well as kind of offering.

varyu and Hotąr in the ante-Vedic times, indicates the first step in the development of the art of sacrificing. At that early time when the (18) Iranians left their Indian brethren on account of a bitter religious contest, which is known in the Brâhmaņas as the struggle between the Devas and Asuras, already the offices of an Adhvaryu and Hotar were distinct, as we may learn from the Zend-Avesta, which exhibits the religion of the Asuras (Ahura religion, its professors calling themselves ahurotkéshô=asura-dikşā, i.e. initiated into the Asura rites). 

But the offices of Udgâtris and that of the Brahma priests were not known to the Aryas at that time; they were introduced subsequently, after the separation. In many Vedic hymns we find, however, the duties principally of the former class (the chanters) mentioned. They are often juxtaposed with those of the Hotars. The term for the perform ance of the Hotri-priests is sants, to praise, recite; that for that of the Udgâtris stu or gái to sing (see, for instance, Rigveda Samh (8,1,1; 6, 62, 5; 6, 69, 2-3); besides the technical names uktha=Sastra and Stoma, såma, are frequently to be met with (see 8, 1, 15; 3, 3, 6; 6,3; 16,9; 14, 11; 6, 24, 7, &c.). Now the absence of all such terms, indica tory of the functions of the Udgâtsis (chanters) in the Afvamedha hymn is certainly remarkable. Their not occuring might, perhaps, be accounted for by the supposition that the chanters were not required at the horse sacrifice. It is true, several smaller sacrifices, such as the Darsaparna måsa, the Châturmâsya Iştis and the animal sacrifice (if performed apart without forming part of a Soma sacrifice) are performed without any chanting ; (19) but for Soma sacrifices of whatever description, the chanters are as indispensable as the Hotars. That the Aśramedha was connected with a soma sacrifice is already at the time of the composition of the hymn in question, undoubtedly follows from the office of Gravagrabha being mentioned in it; for this priest is only required for the extracting of the Soma juice, and has nothing whatever to do with any other sacrificial rite. The mentioning of the Samstar (Maitrâýrúņa) is another indication that the Advamedha already at that early time was accompanied by a Soma sacrifice. For one of the principal duties of the Maitråvaruņa, who may be called the first assistant of the Hotar, is to repeat Sastras, which are only required at Soma sacrifices as the necessary accompaniments of all chants. 

Besides the Udgâtris, we miss the class of the Brahma priests, viz. Brahmâ, Brâhmaņâchamsi, and Subrahmanya, whose services are required 

13 According to Asyal. Dr. Sætras (10,8) there are three Soma days (satyini; required for the horse sacrifice. 

at all great sacrifices. The Brahmà cannot even at small sacrifices, such as the Darsapûrņamâsa Işti, be dispensed with. The Brahman chařsi aud Subrahmanyâ are at Soma sacrifices as indispensable as the Maitrâvaruna; the first has to repeat also Sastras for the chants, the latter to invite every day Indra to the Soma feast (see the note to 1, 3, pp. 382-84). 

The introduction of the Brahmâ priest marks no doubt a new era in the history of the sacrificial art; [20] for to judge from the nature of his duties as superintendent of the sacrifical ceremonies, he was only necessary at a time when the sacrifice had become already very complicated, and was liable to many mistakes. The origin of the office dates earlier than the Brâhmaņas. Unmistakeable traces of it are to be found already in the Samhita of the Rigveda. In one passage 1, 10, 1, the Bralmî priests (brahmânas) are juxtaposed with the Hotřís (arkinaḥ) and Udgåtçis (gůyat rinah). They are there said to "raise Indra just as one raises) a reed." Similarly we find together gayata, chant, samsata, praise, and brahma krinuta make the Brahma (8, 32, 17). In 10, 91, 10 the Brahmi is men tioned along with other priests also, such as the Potar, Nestar, &c. Tho little work done by the Brahmâ priests, or rather their idlences, is men tioned, 8, 92, 30, "do not be as lazy as a Brahmâ priest" (mo $11. trazm meva tandrayur bhuvah). That the Brahmâ priests were thus reproached may clearly be seen from Ait Brâbm. 5, 34. The Brahma pricet is the speaker or expounder of religious matters (10, 71, 11; 117, 8), in which capacity they became the authors of the Brûlamanas. That the Brahmâ was expected to know all secret things, may bo inferred from several passages (10, 85, 3; 16; 35; 36). Bribaspati, the teacher of tho gods, is also called brahmd (10, 143, 3), and Agni is honoured with tho same name (7, 7,5), as well as his pious worshippers of old, tho so-called Angirasaḥ (7, 42, 1). Sometimes the name sigoilies tho Brahman as distinguished from the Kşattriyas brahmani rajani vd (1, 108, 7). [21] It is certainly remarkable, that none of the Brahmi priests is to be found among the priests enumerated in the Advamedla hymn, and we may safely conclude, that their offices were not known at that time. The word brahma (neuter) itself occurs in it in the seventeenth verso), "If any one, in order to make thee sit, did thee harm by kicking theo with his heels, or striking thee with a whip violently so that thou didist snort, I cause all to go off from thee by means of the Brahma, junt as I make flow (the drops of melted butter) by means of a Sruch (sacrificial spoon) over the piece which is among the ready-made offerings (wherkuile). Brahma has here very likely its original meaning, “the sacrificial grass” 

or a certain bunch of it (see the note on pages 4, 5 of this Introduction). For the meaning " prayer," which is here given to it by Sâyana, does not suit the simile. In order to understand it fully, one has to bear in mind that the Adhvaryu' after having cooked and made ready any offering (Purodása or flesh, or Charu, &c.) generally pours from a Sruch some drops of melted butter over it. Now the brahma by means of which the priest is to soothe all injury which the sacrificial horse may have received from kicking or striking, is compared with this Sruch; the drops of melted butter are then the several stalks of the bunch of the sacrificial grass, required *at all sacrifices and their taking out, and throwing away (as is done at all sacrifices, see note 8 to page 79), is compared to the flowing of the drops from the sacrificial spoon. 

Not only is the number of priests less, but the [22] ceremonies are also more simple. It appears from verse 15th, that there was no Puronuvakya or introductory mantra required, but the Yâjyâ alone was sufficiente The latter consisted already of the same parts as in the Brâhmaņas, viz. the Agur, the Yâjyâ mantra, the Vaşatkâra and Anuvaşatkâra (see note 32 to page 95, page 126, and note - 11 to page 133-34). The Agur or the introductory formula, ye yajâmahe, i.e., “what (gods are), those we worship by sacrificing," is very ancient, and seems to go back even beyond the properly so-called Vedic times ; for we meet it even with the same name already in the Zend-Avesta (see note 11 to page 134); even a large number of the Parsi prayer formulas commence with it up to this day, viz. yuzāmaide. The Vaşatkâra or the call vduşat, and the Anuvaşatkâra, or the second call vâuşat preceded by Agri rihi, i. e, "Agni eat (the food),” must be also very old, though we do not find any trace of them in the Parsi ritual, which circumstance can be, however, easily accounted for. The first call váuşat being required in the very moment of the offering being thrown into the fire, and the second at once after it, there was no occasion for them at the Zoroastrian sacrifices ; for the priests are not allowed to throw flesh, or Homa, or even cakes into the fire; they have only to show their offerings to the sacred element. In the Sambitâ itself, the Vaşatkâra is frequently mentioned, and in hymns which show by no means a modern origin (see . 1, 14, 8; 120, 4; 21, 5; 7, 14, 3; 15, 6;-99, 7, &c); some of them appar ently allude to the [28] Anuvaßatkâra, (so, for instance, 7, 156, semán vetu vaşatleritim, 'may he eat this piece ' offered by the call vauşat! vi (in vihi) being one of the characteristic terms of the Anuvaşatára). 

From all we have seen as yet it clearly follows that the Aévamedha hymn is by no means a late, but a very early, production of Vedic poetry,

and that consequently a strict distinction between & Chhanding and Mantra period, making the former by about two hundred years older than the latter, is hardly admissible. 

The same result is to be gained from moro cloxo examination of other pre-eminetly sacrificial lymns, which all would fall under the Mantra period. There being here no occasion to investigate into all hymns of that character, I will only hero make some remarks on the Nâbhânediştha hymns (10, 61-62). Their history is given in thio Ait.

From these two verses as well as from several others in it (princi. pally 2 and 5-8 describing Prajâpati's illicit intercourse with his [25] daughter, see Ait. Br. 3,33), we may clearly perceive that Nâbhâne distha and the hymn in question refer to generation. This view is fully corroborated by the application of it at the sacrifice, as expounded by the Brâhmaṇam, and as eren pre-supposed in the hymn itself. 

We know from various passages of the Brâhmaņas, that one of the principal acts of the sacrificial priests was to make a new body to the sacrificer, and produce him anew by mantras, and various rites, by making him mystically undergo the same process to which he owed his natural life. So, for instance, the whole Pravargya ceremony (see note 1 to pages 41-43), the Ajya and Pra-uga Sastras (see Ait. Br. 2, 35-38; 3, 2) of the morning libation, and the so-called Silpa Sastras (6, 27-31) of the Hotsi-priests are intended for this purpose. Of the latter the two Nâbhânediştha hymns form the two first parts, representing the seed effused, and its transformation to an embryo in its rudest state (see 6, 27). Nâbhânedistha is the sperm when effused ; after having undergone some change in the womb, it is called Narâsamsa." That the hymn originally had such a mystical sense, is evident from the two first verses : 

· [26] (1) "May this awful Brahma, which he (Prajâpati) thus skilfully pronounced in words at the congregation, at the assembly, fill the seven Hotars on the day of cooking (the sacrificial food), when his (the sarificer's) parents and other) liberal men (the priests) are making (his body)." • 

(2) "He established (as place) for the reception of his gift the altar (vedi), destroying and ejecting the enemy with his weapons. (After having thus made the place safe) he then hastily under a very loud cry poured forth his sperm in one continuous (stream)." 

The meaning of these two verses can only be the following: the poet who was no doubt a sacrificial priest himself wishes, that the hymn which be regards as a revelation from Prajâpati, who repeated it at the great sacrificial session which he is so frequently said to have held, may fill the seven Hotri-priests when they, with the same liberality as Prajapati 

*This idea must be very old ; for we find an unmistakeable trace of it in the Zoroastrian tradition. So we read in the Bundehesh (page 80 in Westergaard's edition of the Pehlevi text) that the angel Nerioseng (nerioseng yazd=narásamsa yajata in Sanscrit) intercepted the three particles of sperm which Zoroaster is said to have once lost, and out of which the three great prophets, Oshadar (bami), Oshadar náh, and Sosiosh are expected to spring at the end of the world. Nerioseng clothed the said sperms with lustre and strength (rosnu: Zor), and handed them over to Anahit (the Persian Venus) to look at them They are guarded against the attacks of the Devas (the Indian gods) by 999,999 Frohans (& kind of angels).

(when he poured forth his sperm) are like parents making by their hymns the new celestial body to the sacrificer. The place for reception of the seed poured out mystically in prayer by the Hotars, is the altar; for standing near it (and even touching it with their feet) they repeat the mantras. The reason that they have to regard the Vedi as the safe receptacle of the seed, is to be sought for in the antecedent of Prajapati, who prepared it for the purpose, defending [27] it against the attacks of enemies. After having made it safe, he poured out his seed whence then all creatures sprang (see Ait. Br. 3, 34). 

Nábhânediştha is, according to the verses above quotod, the heavenly guardian of all germs of generation ; all gods, men, beasts, &c., come from him. His assistance is required when the sacrificial pricsta are producing the new celestial body of the sacrificer. Ile looks down from heaven at his relative, that is, the seeds containing the germ of new life poured out mystically by the Hotars in their prayers. Ilis navel is the centre of all births in the universe ; as being nearest ( nearest to the navel' is the literal meaning of nâlhånerliştha), he is the guardian of all seeds. Every seed on earth has only effect as far as he participatos in it. We have here the Zoroastrian idea of the Fravashis (Frohars) who aro the prototypes of all things existing 18 The word nàlihânedıştha muht he very old; for we find it several times in the form nabdnazdista in the Zend Avesta. It is an epithet of the Fravashis (Yasna, 1, 18. Yashts 13, 156), and signifies the lineal descendants in future generationgit (Vend. 4, 5-10 Westergaard). 

[28] Although the Nâbhânediştha hymn (10, 61) is purely sacrificia), and composed at a timo when the Rißis already indulged in speculatialis on the mystical meaning of sacrificial rites, no trace can be found, to show that it is a modern composition. The circumstance, that it is already in the Aitareya Brahmanam traced to Manu, the progenitor of the human race, shows, that its origin is entirely lost in the depths of antiquity, The mentioning of Kaksiran in verso 10, and the occurrence of the “seven Hotars" (in the 1st verse) are no proofs of a lato origin, lor

Kakşivan appears as a celebrated Rişi, who was distinguished as a great chanter and Soma drinker in many other passages, principally in the first book (see Rigveda Samh. 1, 18, 1-2 ; 51, 13; 116, 7; 117, 6; 4, 26, 1), who enjoyed the special favour of the Asvins. He is to the majority of the Vedic şişis whose hymns are kept, a personage of as remote an antiquity as Kaoya, Usanâs, the Angiras, &c. The "seven Hotars"28 occur several times besides (3, 29, 14; 8, 49, 16), most of them with their very names, viz., Potar, Nestar, Agnid, Praśâstar, &c., (1, 15, 2-5; 9; 1, 94, 6; 10, 91, 10). 

The second Nâbhânediştha hymn is certainly later than the first, and contains the germs of the later legend on Nâbhânediştha. The reason that it was also referred to him, is certainly to be sought [29] for in the 4th verse, where is said, “This one (i.e. I) speaks through the navel,'* (nabha), hails you in your residence; hear, O sons of the gods, ye Rişis (to my speech).” The song is addressed to the Aggiras, who are requested to receive the poet. The gift of thousand is also mentioned. 

Let us, after this discussion regarding the antiquity of the Asya medha and Nâbhânediştha hymns, return to the general question on the relationship between the pre-eminently sacrificial mantras and the other production of Vedic poetry. 

If we look at the history of poetry with other nations, we nowhere find profane songs precede religious poetry. The latter owes its origin entirely to the practical worship of beings of a higher order, and must, as every art does, go through many phases before it can arrive at any state of perfection and refinement. Now, in the collection of the hymns of the Rigveda, we find the religious poetry already so highly developed, the language so polished, the metres already so artificially composed, as to justify the assumption, that the songs which have reached our time, are not the earliest productions of the poetical genius, and the devout mind of the ancient Indians. Generations of poets and many family (30] schools in which sacred poetry was regularly taught, just as the art of the bards and scalds with the Celtic and Scandinavian nations, must have preceded that period to which we owe the present 

18 They are, according to the Brahmaņas (see Ait. Br. 6, 10-12), Hotar, Maitråvarana, Brahmaņâchhausi, Achhâvâka, Potar, Nestar, and Agnîdhra. 

19 This expression appears to be strange. It implies a very ancient idea, which muso have been carrent with the Iranians and Indians alike. The navel was regarded as the seat of an internal light, by means of which the seers received what they called revelation. It is up to the present day a belief of the Parsi priests, that the Dasturs or High-priests have a firo in their navel, by means of which they can seo things which are hidden This reminds us of some phenomena in modern somnambulism.

collection. If an old song was replaced by a nor ano, which appeared more beautiful and finished, the former Tras, in most cases, irni cmerably lost. Old and new poets are frequently mentioned in the lymns of the Rigveda; but the more morlorn Pişis of tlie Telio puriul appear not to have regarded the productions of their 116(6Vign with any particular reverence which might have induced them to keep their early relics. 

Now the question arises, are the finished and polislei lymns of the Rigveda with their artificial mcircs the most incient relies of the whole religious literature of the Brilmaus, or are still moro ancient pieces in the other Vedlic writings' to bo found? It is harlly credible, that the Brahmanical priests einplivcii at their sacrifices in the earliest times hymns similar to those which were usel when the ritual became sottled. The first sacrifices were no doubt simple offerings performed without much coremonial. A for appropriato solemn wurls, indienting the giver, the nature of the offering, the dicty to which as well as the purpose for which it was offered, ani acaresses to the objects that were offered, were suflicient. All this could be ombodied in the sacri. ficial formulas known in later times principally by the name of arts, whilst the older one appears to have been Yaga (preserved in pre-reja, anu-yâju, &c). The invocation of the deity by different names, (31) and its invitation to enjoy the meal prepared, may be equally okl. It was justly regarded only as a kind of Yajus, and calleil Dipearliest or Nipas The latter term was principally applied to the cameration of the titles, qualities, &c., of a particular deity, accompanied with in invitation. At the most anciont times it appears that all sacrificial fornits woro spoken by the Ilotar alone; the Adlivaryi vill only his o intari, who arranged the sacrificial conipound, provided the implements, and per formed all manual labour. It was only at the time wire regular metrical verses and hymns woro introduced into the ritual, that a part of the duties of tho Ilotar devolved on the blou Thero arc, in the present ritual, traces to bo found, that the llotar tually met have performed part of the dution of the lihvarsi.

(praisa) to most of the officiating priests, to perform their respective duties. Now at several occasions, especilly at the more solemn sacrifices, the order is to be given either by the Hotar himself, or his principal assistant, the Maitrâvaruņa. So, for instance, the order to the slaugh terers of the sacrificial animal, (32) which is known by the name of Adhrigu-Praişa-mantra (see Ait. Br. 2, 6-7) is given by the Hotar himself, though the formulas of which it is composed have all characteristics of what was termed in the ritual Yajus, and consequently assigned to the Adhvaryu. At the Soma sacrifice all orders to the Hotar to repeat the Yâjya mantra, before the libations are thrown into the fire, are to be given by the Maitrâvaruna, and not by the Adhvaryu. The formulas by which the gods are called to appear, the address to the fire when it is kindled are repeated by the Hotar, not by the Adhvaryu, though they cannot be termed rik, the repetition of which alone was in later times regarded as incumbent upon the Hotar, The later rule, “The Hotar performs his duties with the Rigveda" (in the introductory chapter to the Hiranyakesi and Âpastamba Srauta Sutras) is therefore not quite correct. The Hotar himself even sacrifices on certain occasions what is, according to the later ritual, to be done by the Adhvaryu alone, or, when the offering is given as penance, by the Brahmâ. So, for instance, he sacrifices melted butter before repeating the Advina Sastra (see the note to 4, 7, page 268), which is, as far as its principal parts are concerned, certainly very ancient. 

Now, if we compare the sacrificial formulas as contained in the Yajurveda, and principally the so-called Nigadas, and Nivids, preserved in the Brahmanas and Sûtras with the bulk of the Rigveda hymns, we come to the conclusion, that the former are more ancient, and served the Rişis as a kind of [33] sacred text, just as passages of the Bible suggest ideas to religious poets among Christians. That Vedic poets were per fectly acquainted with several of such formulas and addresses which are still extant, can be proved beyond any doubt. 

Reserving a more detailed treatment of this important question to a future occasion, I here instance only some of the most striking proofs. 

One reference to the Nivid inserted in the Vaišvadeva hymn at the Vaišvadeva Sastra, and my remarks on it (see pages 212-13), the reader will find, that the great Rişi Viévâmitra who with some of his sons are the poets of many hymns which we now possess (as, for instance, of the whole third Mandala), knew this ancient sacrificial formula very well; for one of its sentences setting forth the number of deities is alluded to by him.1 

Certain stereotyped formulus which occur in every Nirid, to what ever deity it might be addressed, occur in lymns and oron commence then. I instance the hymn predam bralama (S, 37), which is certainly an allusion to the senteuce which occurs in all Nivids, poreclam brahma predam kşattram (see note 25 on pago 189.) That tho coincidenco is no mere chance follows from some other characteristic Nirid terms made use of in the hymn in question ; comparo üritha pra &urlutuh with pre dam sunvantam yajamúnan aratu in all Nivids, and kraterija tram 

avasi with predam satiram (aratu). 

The Subrahmanyâ formulas, which is generally called a Nigada (800 on it the note to 0, 3 on pages 383-84) (84) is unmistakably alluded to in the hymn, 1, 51, principally in the first and thirteenth versos. In both, Indra is called mesa, a ram, and urişanas tasya merut. 

The call of the Agnidhra, astu śrâuşat as well as tho Agur addross od to the Hotar, hota yakşat, were known to the Rişis, as we learn from 1, 139, 1. 10. 

The so-called Rituyîjas which are extant in a particular collection of sacrificial formulas, called praişa sukta or proişâdhyaya, occur oven with their very words in several hymns, such as 1, 15; 2, 37. (On the lituyâjas, see note 35 on pages 135-36). 

The so-called Apri bymns are nothing but a poetical lovelopmont of the more ancient Prayâjas, and Anuyûjas (compare the notes 12 on page 18; 14 on pages 81-82; and 25 on pago 110.) 

Many hymns wero directly composed not only for sacrilicial pur poses in general, but even for particular rites. This is girincipally the case with several hymns of Visvimitra. So, for instanco, tho wholo os hymn 3, 8 añjanti ivan adlıvarc (sco about it, Ait. Br. 2, 2) rofuis only to the anointing, orecting, and decorating, of tho sacrificial post; 3, 21 is evidently made for addirossing tlic drops of molted butter which drip from tho omontum, over which they jrore purud (soo Ait. Br. 12); 37 celebrates the offering of the Puroclivit consisting of friul gruinn, par, &c., which belongs to each Sona libativii (sco alit. Br. 2, 1) 

The first ten hymns of tho lirst book of the Rinis la Sanalitii c ain, as it appears, tho Soma ritual (35) of Varlı:imkanlah Mu Of Visvai mitra. It providos, however, only for two lilations, riz., the morning and midday. The first liyin has exactly the nature of an aljva hyun, which forms the privcipal part of the lirnt.

hymns (4-10) all celebrate Indra and it appears from some remarks in the Ait. Br. (3, 20, page 192), that in ancient times the midday libation belonged exclusively to Indra. The ritual for the evening libation is of so peculiar a nature, and so complicated, that we must ascribe to it quite a different origin than to the two other libations. 

The hymns 12-23 appear to contain a more comprehensive ritual of the Kanva family, which is ancient. The 12th hymn (the frst in this collection) is addressed to the Agni of the ancestors, the pravard, who must be invoked at the commencement of every sacrifice; it contains three parts of the later ritual-(a) the pravara, (b) the invocation of Agni by the Nigada, and (c) the request to Agni to bring the gods (the so-called devdvahanam). The 13th is an apri Sûkta containing the Prayâjas, which accompany the very first offerings at every sacrifice. 

These three hymns were, it appears, appropriate to a simple Işți, as it precedes every greater sacrifice. The following hymns refer to the Soma sacrifice. The 15th is a Rituyâja hymn; the Rituyâjas always precede the Ajya Sastra. The hymns from [36] 16-19 contain a ritual for the midday libation, and in 20-22 we find the principal deities of the Sastras of the evening libation. 

The hymns from 44-50 in the first book by Praskaņva, the son of Kaņva, contain, if the Indra hymn (51) is also reckoned, all the principal deities, and metres of the Asvina Sastra, the former even in their proper order, viz., Agni, Uşâs, the Asvins, Sûrya, Indra (see Ait. Br. 4, 7-11). 

These instances, which could be easily greatly enlarged, will, I think, suffice to show that the ritual of the Brâhmaņas in its main features was almost complete at the time when the principal Rishis, such as the Kanvas, Visvamitra, Vasiştha, &c., lived. 

I must lay particular stress on the Nivids which I believe to be more ancient than almost all the hymns contained in the Rigveda. The principal ones (nine in number) are all to be found in the notes to my translation of the 3rd Pañchika (book). That no attention has been paid as yet to these important documents by the few Vedic scholars in Europe, is principally owing to the circumstance of their not having been known to them. It being now generally believed, that the earliest relics of Vedic literature are to be found only in the Rigveda Samhitâ, it is of course incumbent on me to state briefly the reasons why I refer the so called Nivid to a still more remote antiquity. 

The word nivid frequently occurs in the hymns, and even with the epithet púrva or púrvya, old [37] (see 1, 89, 3; 96, 2; 2, 36, 6.) The Marutvatiya Nivida is, as it appears, eren referral io ly limitea 

of (4, 18, 7, compared vith note 2), on page IMI); the rtrition the Nivids is juxtaposed with the performance of the lunara, ia!!! the recital of the Sastras (0, 07, 10). The Brillman remarks the Nivids, particularly that one addressed to uni, as these write if Prajâpati, by means of which he created all lvings (seet Ait. Br. de 33-34). That such an idea, which entirely crimiles with th: 2111111n of Ahuramazda (Ormazd) haring created the work this.ari thar yilnin ali- vairy prayer (see the 19th chapter of the Vasan), must le pop** ancient than the Brahmanas, wo learn from a hymn of the old Pii Kutsa, who is already in many Vedic songs looked upon (9 4 Hagga ul tim remote past. He says (1, 96, 2) that Agni created hy means of the “ first Nivid” the creatures of the Danus (sco pago 1:13). In 1, 4!), 2.1, an old Nivid appears to bo quoted. For tho worci, which follore than sentence, "we call them with tho old Nivid," bear quite tho stamp of such a piece. 

Many Nivids, even the majority of them, aro certainly lost. But the few pieces of this kind of religious literaturo which an still oxlami, are sufficient to show that they must bo very ancient, and aro not to be regarded as fabricatious of tlo sacrilicial priests at the timon when the Brahmaņas were composed. [38] Their stylo is, in the main, just the same in which the hymns are composed, and far moro ancient than that of the Brahmanas. They contain, in short sentence, the principal 1121114*.ty epithets, and feats of tho dcity invoked. They have 114 pomoliek Iniunt, but a kind of rhythmus; or even a parallelismus u numlilin that's ancient llobrew poetry.

verse to Savitar (3, 54, 11) alludes to Savitri Nivids (see them on page 208); the hymn to Dyâvâprithivi (1, 160) is a poetical imitation of the Dyâvâpřithivi Nivids (page 209); the Ribhu hymn (4, 33) resembles very much the Ribhu Nivids (page 210), &c. 

Another proof of the high antiquity of the Nivids is furnished by the Zend-Avesta. The many prayer (89) formulas in the Yasna which commence with nivaê-ahayêmi, i.e., I invite, are exactly of the same nature as the Nivids. 

The Nivids along with many so-called Yajus formulas which are preserved in the Yajurveda, the Nigadas, such as the Subrahmanyâ and the so-called Japa formulas (such as Ait. Br. 2, 38), which are muttered with a low voice only, are doubtless the most ancient pieces of Vedic poetry. The Kişis tried their poetical talent first in the composition of Yajyâs or verses recited at the occasion of an offering being thrown into the fire. Thence we meet so many verses requesting the deity to accept the offering, and taste it. These Yâjyâs were extended into little songs, whicb, on account of their finished form, were called súktam, że. well, beautifully spoken. The principal ideas for the Yâjyás were furnished by the sacrificial formulas in which the Yajurveda abounds, and those of the hymns were suggested by the Nigadas and Nivids. There can be hardly any doubt, that the oldest hymns which we possess, are purely sacrificial, and made only for sacrificial purposes. Those which express more general ideas, or philosophical thoughts, or confessions of sins, such as many of those addressed to Varupa, are comparatively late. 

In order to illustrate that the development of the sacrificial and religious poetry of the ancient Brahmans took such a course as here described, I may adduce the similar one which we find with the Hebrewg. The sacrificial ritual of Moses, as laid [40] down in the Leviticus, knows no rythmical sentences nor hymns which accompanied the oblations offered to Jehovah. It describes only such manual labour, as found with the Brahmans its place in the Yajurveda, and mentions but very few and simple formulas which the officiating priest appears to have spoken when throwing the offering into the fire of the altar. They differed, according to the occasion, but very little. The principal formula was 1717 7ping 777793 77 TIN " a fire offering of pleasant smell for Jehovah,” which exactly cor responds with the Vedic agnaye, indráya, &c. svâhâ ! 22 i.e. a good offering to Agni, Indra, &c. If it was the solemn holocaustum, then the word og hany, i.e. 

23 Tho term svaha is to be traced to the root dhı, to put, with a, to put in, into, and stands for svadha (sutadha). It means the gift which is thrown into the fire. 

XXXII 

holocaustum, was used in addition (Leviticus 1, 9-13); if it was the so called zebakh shlâmim or sacrifice for continued welfare, the word on food, bread, was added (Levit. 3, 11); if it was a penance, the words NIT 'UN (Levit. 7, 5), "this is a penance," were required. When the priost absolved a sacrificer who brought an offering as a penance, he appears to bave used a formula also, which is preserved in the so-fcquently occuring sentence: 021 um nume anything to 3 (Lev. iv, 25. 31: v. 6, 10.) "and he (the priest) shall annul the sin which he has committed, so that he will be pardoned." 23 (41] If we compare these formulas with the psalms, which were composed and used for the worship of Jehovah, then we find exactly the same difference between both, as we discover between the Yajus formulas, Nivids, &c., and the finished hymns of the Rigveda Sarnlita. In the same way as there is a considerable interval of time between the establishment of the Mosaic ritual and the composition of tho psalms, we are completely justified in supposing that a similar space of time intervened between the Brahmanical ritual with its sacrifical formulas, and the composition of the majority of the Vedic hymns. Between Moses and David there is an interval of five hundred years, and if we assume a similar one between the simple Yajus formulas, and such finished hymns as those addressed to Varuņa which M. Müller ascribes to his Chhandas period, we shall not be in the wrong. 

Another proof that the purely sacrificial poetry is more ancient than either profane songs or hymns of a more general religious cliaracter, is furnished by the Shi-king or Book of Odes of the Chinese. Of its four divisions, viz, kûo-fung, i.e. popular songs of the different territories of ancient China, ta-ya and siao ya, i.e. imperial songs, to be used with music at the imperial festivals, and sung, 1.c. hymns in honour of deceased emperors, and vassal kings, the latter, which are of a puroly sacrificial character, are the most ancient pieces. The threo last odes in this fourth division go back as far as the commencement of the Shang dynasty, which ascended the dragon seat in [42] the year 1700 B 0., whilst almost all other pieces in the collection are composed from tho earlier part of the reign of the Chou dynasty down almost to Confucius' timo (from 1120 B.C till about 600 B.C.) 

If we consider that the difference of time between the purely sacrifi cial and non-sacrificial hymns of the Chinese thus amounts to about 

*The priest appears to have addressed these words to thro sinnor who was to bo absolved in this manner, "I annul the sin which thou hast committed, and thou shalt be pardoned." 

xxxii 

1,000 years, we would not be very wrong in presuming similar inter vals to exist between the different hymns of the Rigveda. Kişis like Kâvya, Ufanâs, Kakşivat, Hiranyastúpa, to whom several hymns are traced, were for the Kansas, Visvâmitra, Vasiştha, &c., as ancient per sonages, as the emperors Tang (1765 B.0.) and Wuwang (1120 B.O.) to Confacious (born 551 B. o.) 

On account of the utter want of Indian chronology for the Vedic and post-Vedic times, it will be of course for ever impossible to fix exactly the age of the several hymns of the Rigveda, as can be done with most of the psalms and many of the odes of the Shi-king. But happily we possess at least one astronomical date which furnishes at any rate the ex ternal proof of the high antiquity of Vedic literature, which considerably tends to strengthen the internal evidence of the same fact. I here mean the well known passage in the Jyotişam, or Vedic calendar, about the position of the solstitial points. The position there given carries us back to the year 1181 according to Archdeacon Pratt's, and to 1186 (48) B.0, according to the Rev. R. Main's calculations. The questions on the age of this little treatise and the origin of the Nakşatra 35 system, about which [44] there has been of late so much wrangling among the few Sapscrit scholars of Europe and America, are of 

** See the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal of the year 1862 pages 49-50. Max Muller's Preface to the 4th Volume of his edition of the Rigveda Samhita, page LXXXV. 

25 There can be hardly any doubt, that the Naksatra system of the Indians, Chinese, Persians and Árabs is of a common origin, but it is very difficult to determine with what nation it originated. The original number was twenty-eight. I do not intend fully to discuss here the important question, but I wish only to direot attention to the circumstance overlooked as yet by all the writers on the subject, that the terms which the Indians, Arabs, and Chinese use for expressing the idea “constellation" have in all the three languages, Sanscrit, Chinese, and Arabic, precisely the same meaning, viz, a place where to pass the night, a station. This is certainly no mero chance, bat can only be accounted for by the supposition, that the framers of the Nakşatra system regarded the several Naksatras as heavenly stations, or night quarters, where the travelling mood was believed to put on his journey through the heavens. Let us examine these terms. 

The Chinese expression for Nakşatra is Sinu (spelt by Morrison suh and sew, by Medhurst sew with the third or departing tone). The character representing it which is to be found under the 40th radical, strokes 8 (see Morrison's Chinese Dictionary, Vol. 1 page 847) is composed of three signs, viz. that for a roof, that for man, and that for a hundred. Its original meaning therefore is "a place where a hundred men find shelter, a station or night quarters for a company of soldiers " The word is, as is the case with most of the Chinese words, used as a substantive, adjective, and verb. 

As a substantive it denotes " a resting place to pass the night at" with a road-hoase (lu shil), i.e, an inn, or a halting place in general ; such places were situated at the distance of every thirty Li. Thence it is metaphorically employed to express the 

XXXIV 

(45) minor importance compared with the fact and the age of the obser vation itself. That an astronomical observation was taken by the station on the heavens where the travelling moon is supposed to put up. In this sense the Chinese speak of ölh shił pa siu * the twenty-eight halting places" (on the 

heavens). 1. As an objective it means past, former, i. e, the night-quarters which frere just left. 

In the sense of a verb, but never in that of a substantive, we find it frequently used in two of the so-called See-shu or four Classical books of the Chinese, viz. tho Lun-yu (the Confucian Analects) and in Meng-tse, 

In order to show the use of this important word in the Classical writings, I hero quote some instances : 

(a) intrans, to pass the night, to stop over night, Lun-yu 14, 41; tse 11. siu Yu Shiiv-man, 

.e. Tse-Iu (one of the most ardent and zealous disciples of Confucius) passed the night at Shih-man ; 18. 7. 8 ibidem ; chih Tse-lu siu, i.e. be detained Tse-u to pass the night (with him). Meng tse 2, 2, 11, 1; Meng-tse K'iu Tsi sia 47 Chaw, i. e. Meng-tse after having left Tši, passed the night at Chow; 2, 2, 12, 4, ibidem: yu san siz oth hën chun Chow, yu yu sin i wei suh, i. €. When I, after having stopped for 

three nights left Chow, I thought in my mind my departure to be speedy still. (b) traps. to make pass the right, to keep over night. Lux-yu 10, 8, 8: tsc yu kung 

pü siz já, when he (Confucius) Sacrificed at the Duke's (assisted th0 Duke in sacrificing) he did not keep the (sacrificial) flesh over night. In this sense it is several times metaphorically used ; so Lun-yu 12, 2, 2; 18e-114 2111 giu no, i.e. Tse-lu never kept a promise over night (he carried it out at one, before he 

went to rest). (c) to have taken up his quarters, to be at rest, Lun-yu 7, 26 : yih på she siu, ho 

(Confucius) shot, but not with an arrow and string at (animals) which were 

at rest (asleep). The Arabic word for the Nakshatras is jie manzil phur. J, live menázil," a place where to put up, qurters," from the root is, to make a journey, to put up at a place as a guest. 

This name for the constellations must be very ancient with tho Somitio nations, for we find it already in the Old Testament (Book of tho Kings ii. 23, 5) in tho form on het muzzaloth; it has no proper etymology in Hobrow (for the root by nazul, to which alone it could be traced, means to flow), and is apparently introduced as a foreign word from some other Semitic nation, probably the Babylonians. The Jewish comment tors had no clear conception of the proper meaning of tho word; they take it to mean star in general, and then the twelve signs of the Zodiac, But from the context of the passage in the Book of the Kings, just quotert, where it stands together will the moon and the whole host of the treavens (* for tho moon and tbo mazzaloth and tho whole host of the heaven") it undoubtedly follows, that its meaning eannot bo"starin general, which idea is expressed by the “ whole host of the heavens," but something particular in the heavens connected with the moon. Tho use of tho samo word in Arabic for expressing the idea of constellation, heavenly mansions of tho moou, proves beyond any doubt, that the mazzaloth mean the same. 

Now the Sanscrit word naksatra has originally no other mcaning than sithor siu or manzil have. The arrangement of the meaning of this word which is made in Boehtlingk and Roth's Sanscrit Dictionary is ipsujicient and troated with tho samo superficiality as the majority of the more difficult Vedic werds in that much lauded work. They make it to mean star in general (sidus), the stars, and then constellation, station of the moon. But the very formation of the word by moans of the suflix atra 

Brahmans as early as the 12th century before Christ is proved bem yond any doubt by the date to be elicited from the observation itself. If astronomical calculations of past events are of any worth, we must accept as settled the date of the position of the solstitial (46) points as recorded in the Jyotişam. To believe that such an observation was imported from some foreign country, Babylon or China, could be absurd, for there is nothing in it to show, that it cannot have been made in the north-western part of India, or a closely adjacent country. A regulation of the calendar by such observations was an absolute necessity for the Brahmans ; for the proper time of commencing and ending their sacrifices, principally the so-called Sattras or sacrificial sessions, could not be known without an accurate knowledge of the time of the sun's northern and southern progress. The knowledge of the calendar forms such an essential part of the ritual, that many import ant conditions of the latter cannot be carried out without the former. The sacrifices are allowed to commence only at certain lucky constel lations, and in certain months. So, for instance, as a rule, no great sacrifice can commence during the sun's southern progress (daksinayana); for this is regarded up to the present day as an unlucky period by the indicates, that something particular must be attached to its meaning; compare patatra a wing, literally a means for flying, vadhatra a weapon, literally a means for striking, yajate ran the keeping of a sacrificial fire, literally the means or place for sacrificing ; umatra, a drinking vessel, literally a place to which a thing goes which holds it. According to all analogy we can derive the word only from naks, which is a purely Vedic root, and means to "arrive at." Thus naksatra etymologically means, either the means by which one arrives, or the place where oue arrives, a station. This expresses most adequately the idea attached by the Indians to the Naksatras as mansions for the travelling moon. But even if we waive this derivation, and make it a compound of nak (instead of naktà, see Rigveda 7, 71, 1) and satra-sattra, a session for the nights night quarters, we arrive at the same meaning. The latter derivation is, I think, even preferable to the former. The meanings of the word are to be classed as follows: (1) station, qurters where to pass the night. In this sense it is out of use ;(2) especially the stations on the heavens where the travelling moon is supposed to put up, the twenty-eight constellations ; (3) metonymiclly stars in general, the starry sphere (Rig veda 7, 86, 1: raksatram paprathachcha blúma, he spread the starry sphere, and the earth). The latter use is pre-eminently poetical, as poets always can use pars pro toto The naksatras as stations of the moon were perfectly known to the Rişis, as every one can convince himself from the many passages in the Taitirîya Brahmanan, and the Atharvaveda. That these books are throughout much later than the songs of the Rigveda is just what I have strong reasons to doubt. The arrangement of the meanings of naksatra as given here entirely coincides with all we know of the history of either the word siu ia Chinese, or maneil, mazzaloth in the semitic languages. The Chinese, especially poets, used the word sitt in the sense of star or stars in general, and so did the Rabbis in the Mishnah and the Talmud, according to the testimony of Juda ben Karish (see Gesenii Thesaurus Lingua Hebræa, et Chaldææ ii. page 869).

Brahmans, in which even to die is belived to be a misfortune. The great sacrifices take place generally in spring, in the months Chaitra and Vaisakha (April and May). The sattras which lasted for one year were, as one may learn from a careful perusal of the 4th book of the Aitareya Brâhmaṇam, nothing but an imitation of the sun's yearly course. They were divided into two distinct parts, each consisting of six months of thirty days each ; in the midst of both was the Vişuvan, i.e. equator or central day, cutting the [47] whole Sattra into two halves. The ceremonies were in both the halves exactly the same ; but they were in the latter half performed in an inverted order. This represents the increase of the days in the northern, and their decrease in the southern progress ; for both increase and decrease take place exactly in the same proportions. 

In consideration that these Sattras were already at the time of the compilation of the Brâhmaņas an old institution, we certainly can find nothing surprising in the circumstance, that the Indian astronomers made the observation above-mentioned so early as the 12th century B.C. For the Sattras are certainly as early as, if not earlier than, this time. Sattrag lasting for sixty years appear even to have been known already to the authors of the Brahmaņas (see page 287). 

Now that observation proves two things beyond doubt : (1) That the Indians had made already such a considerable progress in astronouivál science, early in the 12th century, as to enable then to take such obser vations; (2) That by that time the whole ritual in its main features as laid down in the Brâhmañas was complete. 

We do not hesitate therefore to assign the composition of the bulk of the Brâhmaņas to the years 1400-1200 B.O.; for the Samhita we require a period of at least 500-600 years, with an interval of about two hundred years between the end of the proper Brûlimana period. Thus we obtain for the bulk of the Samhitâ the space from 1400-2000; the oldest hymns and [48] sacrificial formulas may be a few hundred years more ancient still, so that we would fix the very coinmencement of Vedic Literature between 2400-2000 B. O. If we consider the completely authenticated antiquity of several of the sacred books of the Chinese, such as the original documents, of which the Shu-king, or Book of History, is composed, and the antiquity of the sacrificial songs of the Shi-king, which all carry us back to 1700-2200 B.O., it will certainly not be surprising that we assign a similar antiquity to the most an cient parts of the Vedas. For there is nowhere any reason to show, 

XXXvii 

that the Vedas must be less ancient than the earliest parts of the sacred books of the Chinese, but there is on the contrary much ground to believe, that they can fully lay claim to the same antiquity. Already at the time of the composition of the Brâhmaņas, which as we have seen, cannot be later than about 1200 B. C., the three principal Vedas, i.e. their respective Sanhitâs, were believed to have proceeded directly from the mouth of Prajapati, the lord of the creatures, who occupies in the early Vedic mythology the same place which is, in the later writings, held by Brahmadeva. This could not bave been the case, had they not been very ancient. In a similar way, the Chinese ascribe the ground text of their most ancient and most sacred book, the Y-king, i.e. Book of Changes, to a kind of revelation too, which was made to Fuhi, the Adam of the Chinese, by a Dragon horse, called Lung-ma. 

- Speculations on the nature of the sacrificial rites, [49) and cognate topics of a mystical character which form the proper sphere of the Brâh maņas, commenced already during the Samhita period, as one may learn from such hymns as Rigveda 1, 95, and the so-called Vamana Sûkta 1, 164. Even at the time of the composition of the present Brâhmaņas, there existed already some time-hallowed sayings, which resemble in every respect those dicta of the Brahmâ priests, of which the bulk of the Brâbmaņas consists. I instance here the Brah modyam (Ait. Br. 5, 25), which was used already at that time at the conclusion of the tenth day's performance of the Dvadasâha sacrifice. It is, therefore, very difficult to draw a strict line of separation between the period during which the hymns were composed, and that one which brought forward the speculations known by the pame of Brahmaņas. On a more close comparison of the mystical parts of the Samhita with the Brâhmaņas, one must come to the conclusion, that the latter were com menced already during the period of the former. 

Let us say a few words on the division made of the contents of the Brahmaņas by the Indian divines and philosophers. According to the introductory chapters to the Hiranyâkesi (and Apastamba Sútras) the Brahmanas contain the following topics: 

(1) Karmavidhanam, or vidhi, i.e. rules on the performance of particular rites. To this class all those sentences in the Brâbmaņas are referred which contain an order expressed in the potential mood, such as yajeta, he ought to sacrifice ; samset, he ought [50] to repeat (such and such a verse) ; kuryát, he ought to proceed (in such or such a way), &c. This is the prin cipal part of the Brâhmaņas, and has for the BrahmansXXXV111 

about the same significance as in the Talmudic Literature the halaltar has for the Jews; it is simply authoritative. 

(2) Arthavdda, This term comprises the numerous cxplanatory remarks on the meaning of mantras and particular rites, the reasons why a certain rite must be performed in a certain way. This is the speculative part, and is on account of its containing the germs of all Hindu philosophy, and even of grammar, of the greatest importanco. There is nowhere anything like an approach to & regular system per ceptible, but only occasional remarks bearing on philosophical and grammatical topics. For the history of gramınar, the fifth Panchikil of the Aitareya Brâhmanam is of a particular interest. Wo learn from it, that at that time not only numerous attempts were madlo to explain the meaning of words by etymology, but that the Brahmans eren had already commenced to analyse the forins of speech by inaking distinc tions between singular and plural, present, past, and future tensos, lo. The idea of mukti or final absorption in the Supremo Boing, is taught in the later Vedânta philosophy, is even with inost of its particulars spoken out in several of those explanatory remarks, I alludo horo to the frequently occurring terms, sayujyalà junction, sarripinta identity of form, salokatd identity of place, which mark in the lator times (lifferent stages of the final beatitude. [51] The principal tendency of this part it, to show the close connection of the visible and invisible worlds, botween things on earth, and their counterparts or protoiypes in heaven. I'an theistic ideas pervade all the Brahmanas, and are already traceablo in bymns of the Samhitâ. 

(3) Ninda, censure. This refers principally to the controversial remarks contained in all Brühmaņas. Thcro was amongst these ancient divines and metaphysicians often difference of opinion as to tho perform ance of a certain rite, or the choice of a particular inantra, or their meaning. One criticised the practice of the other, and cuticlumneri its application often in the strongest torms. The consure is generally introduced by the expression, “but this opinion is not to be attenim 100," 

The sacrificers are often cautioned from allapting such a malpractice, by the assertion that if a priest would proceed in such or such a way, the sacrificer would lose his life, be burned by the sacrificial fire, xfe. 

(4) Samsů, i. c. praise, recommeudation. This part crollo porines porinei pally those phrases which express that the performance of such or suvli a rite with the proper knowledge, produces tho cliect desired. They alinost invariably contain the expression, ya evam voulu, 1.4, who has such a

knowledge. The extreme frequency of this phrase in the Brahmanas, and Upanişads, is probably the reason, that the whole sacred know ledge was comprised afterwards only by the general term veda. Origi nally [52] it appears to have applied to Brâhmaņa like sentences and explanations only. 

(5) Purakalpa, i. e. performance of sacrificial sites in former times. Under this head come the numerous stories of the fights of the Devas and Asuras, to which the origin of many rites is attributed, as also all Legends on the sacrifices performed by the gods. This very interesting part forms the historical (or rather legendary) background of the whole sacrificial art. All rites were traced to the gods as their originators, or even to Prajâ pati, the Supreme Being, the Lord of creatures. We can derive one important historical fact from the legends on the fight between the Devas and Asuras, viz., that the religious contest between the ancient Indians (represented by the Devas) and the Iranians (repre sented by the Asuras, contained in the name Ahuramazda=Ormazd) took place long before the time of the composition of the Brâhmaņas, that is, before the 12th century B.O. This is another proof corroborative of the high antiquity ascribed by Grecian writers to Zarathustra (Zoroaster), the prophet of the Asura nation (Iranians), who did manfully battle against idolatry and the worship of the Devas, branded by him as "devils." That contest which must have been lasting for many years appeared to the writers of the Brahmanas as old as the feats of King Arthur appear to English writers of the nineteenth century. 

(6) Parakriti, i.e. the achievement or feat of another. This head comprises the stories of certain performances of renowned Srotrigas, of sacrificial (53) priests, of gifts presented by kings to Brahmans, the successes they achieved. The last book of the Aitareya particularly is full of this class of topics. 

These six heads are often, however, brought only under two principal ones, viz., vidhi and arthavada. The latter then comprises all that is not injunction, that is, all topics from 2 to 6. This philosophical division exactly corresponds to the division of the contents of the Talmud by the Jewish Rabbis into two principal parts, viz: halakah, i.e. rule of con duct, which is as authoritative as the thorah (law of Moses), and haggadah, i.e. story, parable, and in fact everything illustrative of the former. 

II. The Aitareya Brahmanam in particular. The Aitareya Brahmanam is one of the collections of tho sayinga ol ancient Brahmâ priests (divines and philosophers), illustrative and ex planatory of the duties of the so-called Hotri-priests. The latter perform ing the principal part of their duties by means of the mantias, tormed rik, and contained in the so-called Rigveda Samhita, tlo Aitareya in therefore one of the Brahmanas belonging to the Rigveda. There must bave been, as we may learn from Pånini and Patañjali's 11.11.ibita, a much larger number of Brahmanas belonging to cach Veda; and even Sâyaņa, who lived only about four hundred years ago, was it.fmuintes with more than we have now. To the Rigvedla wo know at present besides [54] the Aitareya, only the Kâuşitaki Brilmasam, which is alho) called Sâökhayana. Both appear to have been known to the mammarian Pânini, as one may gather from the rule (v. 1, 02, which he gives ro garding the formation of names of Brahmanas consisting of thitiya anul forty Adhyâyas; for the Kauşitaki actually consists of thirty iiml tho Aitareya of forty Adhyâyas, which were afterwards dividert into ciglio Pañchikâs, each of which comprises five Adlyáyas.

The name " Aitareya” is by Indian tradition tracod to Ibri.

Afterwards the Brahmanam, commencir.g with atha mañávratam (the beginning words of the first Aitareya Aranyaka) and ending with acharya acharya (the two last words of the third Aranyaka)" was also revealed in the shape of the vow of an hermit* (aranyakavratarú pam). 

The Aitareya Brâhmaṇam, as well as the Kâuşitaki, do not treat of all the sacrifices and sacrificial rites which are mentioned and desa cribed in the books of Yajurveda, which may be (principally the Sûtras) regarded as the proper sacrificial encyclopedia. They were, however, perfectly well known to the authors of these Brâhmanas, as we may learn from the fact, that the pames of several sacrifices, such as Vajapeya, Aptor yama (see 3, 41) are mentioned without the description of the rituals belonging to them. Several things concerning [56] the Hotạis whose duties principally are treated at every Soma sacrifice are left out. So the ceremony of choosing the sacrificial priests (ritvig-varanam) by the sacria ficer, iacluding the Hotars, is left out, as Sâyana has already observed. But every Hautra-prayoga, i.e. practical hand-book for the Hotfi-priests (for each sacrifice there are separate prayogas for each set of priests required), commences with it; the topic is generally treated in the Satras belonging to the Yajurveda ; the principal mantras required at that occasion are to be found in the first chapter of the Tândya Brâhmanam of the Sâmaveda. The dialogue used at this occasion is interesting, and throws some light on the nature and character of some sacrifices; there fore I give here some account of it. 

The person who wishes to perform the Agnistoma sacrifice, for instance, sends a delegate called Somapraváka to all Srotriyas (sacrificial priests) whose services he wishes to engage for his forthcoming Soma sacrifice, to ask whether they would be willing to officiate at this occasion. The dialogue between the Somapravaka and the Hotar is as follows: S. * There will be a Soma sacrifice of such and such one; you are respect Fully requested to act as Hotar at it." H. “What sacrifice is it?" S. * The Jyotiştoma-Agnistoma-Soma sacrifice." H. " What priests (ritvijah) will officiate ?', S. “Vişņu, Mitra,* " &c. H. “What is the reward for 

* This remark throws some light on the relationship in which the five treatises, of which the present Aitareya Arapyaka consists, and each of which bears the name ára nyaka, stand to one another. Only the three first Aranyakas were according to this potice regarded as a divine revelation to the Aitareya Rini; the two others are then tater additions, and did not form originally part of the Aitareya Arapyaka. 

3 According to Brahminical ideas, a vow, a curse, a blessing, &c., can assume a visible form and so bocome manifest to the mental eyes of men. * « The priests represent the gods. 

the priests ? S. "One hundred and twelve cows." [57] If the prieste have accepted the invitation, then the sacrificer has actually to appoint them to their respective offices. This is the varanam or selection (of the priests). 

The sacrificer first mentions the gods who are to act as his priests, * Agni (the fire) is my Hotar, Aditya (the sun) my Adhvaryu, the Moon my Brahmâ, Parjanya (the god of rain) my Udgåtar, the Sky (akasa) is my Sadasya (superintendent), the waters are my Hotrâsansis (all the minor Hotri-priests); the rays my Chamasa Adhvaryus (cup-bearers). These divine priests I choose (for my sacrifice)." After having thus ap pointed the gods, who are to act as his divine priests, he now proceeds to appoint the "human" (mánuşa) priests. This is at the Agnistoma done with the following formula, "I (the name) of such and such a Gotra, will bring the Jyotiştoma sacrifice by means of its Agnistuma part, with the Rathantara-Pțiştha, four Stomas (the nine, fifteen, seventeen and twenty-one-fold), for which ten things, cows and so on are required, and for which as fee one hundred and twelve cows must be given. At this sacrifice be thou my Hotar.". The Hotar then accepts the appointment by the following formula: “May the great thing thou spokest of (unto me). the splendour thou spokest of, the glory thou spokest of, the Stoma thon spokest of, the way of performance thou spokest of, the enjoyment thou spokest of, the satisfaction thou spokest of; may all that thou spokesto come to me; may it enter me; may I have enjoyment through it. Agai is thy Hotar. He is [58] thy (divine) Hotar. I am thy (human) Hotar." All priests are appointed in the same way, and by the same formulas. 

After this disgression let us discuss the contents of the Aitareya Brâhmaņam. It treats in its eight books, or forty chapters, each of which is subdivided into a certain number of kandikás, i.e. small sections, para graphs, as we have seen, almost exclusively of the duties of the seven Hotri-priests at the great Soma sacrifices, and the different royal inaugur ation ceremonies. All minor sacrifices and Istis, although they require the services of a Hotar, are excluded. The Hotri-priests are to be divided into thres distinct classes : (1) The Hotar, the chief of all IIotsi-priests. (2) The Botrakas, i.e., the little Hotras; these are, Maitriivaruna (Irasllstar) Brâhmanâchbaṁsi, and Achhavaka. (3) The Hotrašansinala, 2.c, the repeaters of the Hotri verses; they are, Potar, Neştar, and Agnidbra. 

The first thirteen chapters (the two first books, and the three first chapters (of the third) treat of the duties of the chief Ilotar at the Agniştoma Soma sacrifices only; for this is the modol (prakriti) of 

xliii 

all Soma sacrifices which last for one day only (the so-called aikâhikas); all other Soma sacrifices of the same duration are mere modifications (vikriti) of it. It is regarded as an integral part of the Jyotiştoma, and said to consist of the following seven sacrifices: (1) Agnistoma, (2) Atyag niştoma, (3) Okthya, (4) Solasi, (5) Atirâtra, (6) Vâjapeya, (7) Aptoryâma Asv. Sr. S. 6, 11). In many places, however, the [59] term Jyotiştoma is equivalent to Agnistoma. The Aitareya does not know these seven parts, as belonging together, but simply remarks, that they follow the Agniştoma as their prakriti (3, 41). The Atyagnistoma is not even mentioned in it at all. 

All the duties of the Hotar at the Agnihtoma are mentioned almost in the exact order in which they are required. It lasts generally for five days. The ceremonies are then divided as follows: 

First day.--Preliminary ceremonies, such as the election of the priests giving them presents (madhuparka), the Dikşaniya Isti, and the Dikşâ itself. 

Second day.~The Prâyaniya or opening Isti; the buying of the Soma; the Atithya Işți, Pravargya, and Upasad twice (once in the forenoon, and once in the afternoon). 

Third day.Pravargya and Upasad twice again. 

Fourth day.-Agnipraņayanam, Agni-Soma-pranayanam, Havírdhana pranayanam. The animal sacrifice. 

Fifth day. The squeezing, offering and drinking of the Soma juice at the three great Libations, viz. the morning, midday, and evening Liba tions. The concluding Işti (udayaniya). Ablution (avabhrita). 

The ceremonies of the four first days are only introductory, but abso lutely necessary; for without then no one is allowed to sacrifice and drink the Soma juice. The Soma ceremony is the holiest rite in the whole Brahmanical service, just as the Homa ceremony of the Parsi priests is regarded by them as [60] the most sacred performance. No Parsi priest is allowed to perform it, if he does not very frequently undergo the great purification ceremony, called the Barashnom of nine nights. In the same way every Brahman has, as often as he brings a Soma sacrifi'co - to undergo the Díkşâ (see 1, 3; 4, 26.) One such ceremony is even not considered sufficient. For the sacrifice has besides the Dikşå to undergo the Pravargya, which is a similar preparation for the great Soma day. Even the animal sacrifice must precede the solemn Soma fiestival; for it is of minor importance. The animal is instead of the sacrificer himself. 

Iliy 

The animal when sacrificed in the fire, goes to the gods, and so does the sacrificer in the shape of the animal (see page 80 of the translation). The animal sacrifice is vicarious. Being thus received among the gods, the sacrificer is deemed worthy to enjoy the divine beverage, the Soma, and participate in the heavenly king, who is Soma. The drinking of the Soma juice makes him a new man; though a new celestial body had been prepared for him at the Pravargya ceremony, the enjoyment of the Soma beverage transforms him again; for the nectar of the gods flows for the first time in his veins, purifying and sanctifying him. This last birth to the complete enjoyment of all divine rights is symbolically indicated in rites of the morning libation (see 32, 35; 38; 3, 2).

. . The principal features of this Agniştoma sacrifice must be very: ancient. For we discover them almost complete with the Parsis. They also do not prepare (61] the corresponding Homa (Soma) juice alone, but it must always be accompanied with other offerings. The Purodaśa of the Brahmans, which always belongs to a Soma libation, is represented by the Dêrûn (holy bread), the animal offer ing indicated by the ring of hair (varasa) taken from an ox, to be placed on the same table with the Home The IIoma shoots are treated in the same way, when brought to the spot, as the Brahmans treat them. The Parsi priest sprinkles them with water, which is exactly the apyāyana ceremony of the Brahmans. Ho must go round the fire with the Homa just as the Brahmans carry the Soma round the sacrificial compound (see 1, 14). The ceremonies of preparing and drinking both the Homa and Soma juice are quite similar. The water required for it must be consecrated, which exactly corresponds to the Vasativaris and Ekadhanâs of the Brahmanical Soma service (2, 20). The Zota of the Parsis drinks his cup filled with Loma in three turns, so does the Hotar also from the Graha. After the libation has been poured from the Grahas into the fire, and drunk by the Hotar, the Stotrax are chanted, and then the Sastras belonging to them recited. In a similar way the Zota priest repeats, shortly after having enjoyerl the Iloma, the lithils of Zarathustra Spitama (Zoroaster), which [62] are metrical compositions, and represent the Sastras of the Brahmanical Soma service. Ile must repeat five such Gå thâns, just as there are five Sastras, at the inorning

The mantra repeated at that occasion is Yasna 10, 1, "May the water-drops (sprinkled over the Boma) fall to the destruction of the Devas, and Devis."

aly 

and midday libations, and at the Ukthya Soma sacrifice at the evening libations also. * These are only a few of the points of comparison which I could easily enlarge ; but they will be sufficient to show, that the Agnistoma Soma sacrifice was originally the same ceremony as the Homa rite of the Parsi priests. The opinions of both the Brahmans and Parsis on the effect of the drinking of the Soma (Homa) juice are besides exactly the same. The Brahmaps believe that it leads to heaven; so do the Parsi Priests. They say, that Homa is a plant, and a great angel. Any one who has drunk the Homa juice becomes united with this angel, and after his death an inhabitant of paradise. For the juice which is in the body of the priest who has drunk him, goes to heaven, and connects him mystically with the angel. 

With particular care are the the so-called Sastras or recitations of the Hotři priests treated in the Aitareya Brâhmaņam. The fifth chapter of the second, and the three first chapters of the third book are entirely taken up with the exposition of the Shastras of the Hotar at the morning, midday, and evening libations. As the reader may learn from a perusal principally of the third book, the Sastras always belong to Stotras or performances by the Sâma singers, viz: the Udgâtar or chief singer, the Prastotar who chants the prelude, and the Pratihartar (63) who.chants the response. Their recitations must be very ancient, as we have seen ; for they are by the name ukthå (exactly corresponding to ukhdhem in the Zend language) frequently mentioned in the Sanhitâ. A closer examination of them will throw much light on the history of the composition of the Vedic hymns. As ancient as the Sastras are the Stomas, the exposition of which forms one of the topics of the Sâmaveda Brâhmanas (see note 18 on page 237-38). The word stoma is in the form stoma also known in the Zend Avesta. The Parsi priests understand by it a particular sacrificial ceremony of minor importance, which consists in consecrating a meal (meat is at this occasion indispensable) in the honour of an angel or a deceased person, to be enjoyed afterwards by the whole party assembled. That the idea of " sacrificial rite" was attached also by the Brahmans to the word, clearly follows from the terms, Agniştoma and Jyotiştoma. The musical performance which was originally alone called a Stoma, formed a necessary part of certain sacrifices, and was then, as pars pro toto, applied to the whole rite. 

The universal character of the Agniętoma and its meaning is treated especially in the fourth chapter of the third book. In its last chapter, and 

xlvi 

Mange 

in the two first of the fourth, the principal modifications of the Agniatama are mentioned, and briefly described, viz., tho Ukthya, Solasi, and Atiratra, along with the Asvina Sastra. 

The Atirâtra sacrifice introduces, horvever, the [64] Satiras or sacrificial sessions, the principal rules for the Hotri performances of which are laici down in the third chapter of the fourth book. They are applicable for Sattras which last for a whole year. The two last chapters of the fourth. and the first four chapters of the fifth book describe very minutely the duties of the Hotar during the ten principal days of the Dvadasila whick may be performed as a Sattra, or as a Alina (a Soma sacrifico lasting for more than one, and less than thirteen days). 

The last chapter of the fifth book is taken up with miscellaneous matter, such as the penances required of an Agnihotri when he becomes guilty of some fault, or if some misfortune shouki befal him regarding hia duties towards his sacred fires, and the question, whether the Agnihotrain (daily burnt offering) is to be offered before or after sunrise ; it further treats of the duties of the Brahmi priest, how ho has to jurform the penances for mistakes committed by any one of the lirfurmning priests. 

The whole sixth book treats, after somo remarks on the oflices of the Grâvastut and Subrahmanyan, almost exclusively of the duties of the six minor Hotsi-priests, principally at the great Soma sacrilicos, which 

last for one week at least, or for a series of weeks (Saba) Wo find in it descriptions of the so-called Silpa Sastrae, or "skilful (rathor very artificial) recitations" of the minor llotars. Thes0 Sastras, prin cipally the Valakhilyas, the Vrişâkapi, Ernyitnirent, and the no-called Kuntapa hymns, are no doubt the latest auditions, looking liko (65) decorations, to the ritual of the Ilotsi-priests. The wholo book has tho appearance of a suppliment to tho fourth and ofth. 

The seventh and eighth books trcat suivi alls of the sacrifices of the Ksattriyas and the relationship in which the princes stand to the Brahmans. They are, from an historical point of view, the most important part of the whole Brahmanam. 

• The seventh book describes first the division of the sacrificial animal into thirty-six single pieces, and their distribution among the officiating priests, the sacrificer, his wife, and other persons connected with the performance of the sacrifice." 

Then follows a chapter of penances for neglects on the part of an Agnihotri, or mishaps which might befal Lim. This is a continuation of the fifth chapter in the fifth book.

In the third chapter we are introduced to the rites of the princely inauguration ceremonies connected with a sacrifice, by the story of Sunashepa. On account of its containing Rik verses, as well as Gathâs (stanzas) it was to be told to the king on the day of its inauguration by the Hotar. The story is highly interesting; for it proves beyond doubt the existence of human sacrifices among the ancient Brahmans, and shows that they were in a half savage state ; for we find here a Brahman selling hiş son to a prince to be immolated. 

Now three kinds of such inauguratory sacrifices for the king, called Rajasůyas, are described, viz. [66] Abhişeka, Punarabhişeka, and Mahabhi şeka. The principal part of all these ceremonies consists in the sprinkling of holy water over the head of the kings, which is called abhişeka. It corresponds to the ceremony of anointing the kings with the Jews. It is of particular interest to observe that the Brahmans at this occasion did not allow the king to drink the proper Soma juice, but that he had to drink instead of it, a beverage prepared from the roots and leaves of several trees. The enjoyment of the Soma juice was a privilege reserved by the Brahmans to themselves alone. The king was, properly speaking, even not entitled to bring a sacrifice at all. It was only for the sake of the most extravagant gifts which the shrewd Brahmans extorted from kings for their offices, that they allowed him to bring a sacrifice. But before he could do so, he was to be made first a Brahman himself ; at the conclusion of the ceremony he had, however, to resign his Brahmanship, and return to his former caste. 

The last chapter of the Brâhmanam is taken up with the appointment by the king of a duly qualified Brahman to the office of a house-priest, who is called purohita, i.e., president, superintendent. The word, as well as the office, must be very ancient; for we find it not only in the Samhita of the Rigveda, but even in the Zend-Avesta. It is, as to etymology, the same word as paradhâta,? which is generally [67] the epithet of one of the most ancient Tranian heroes, of Haoshyanha (see Yashts 5, 20; 9, 3; 15, 7; 17, 24 ed. Westergaard) the Hosheng of the Shâhnâmah. The later Iranian legends, as preserved in the Shahnâmah, made of the para. dhâtas a whole dynasty of kings, which they call Peshdadians (the modern Persian corruption of the primitive paradhâta) who then precede the Kayanians (the Kavis of the Vedas). This shows that the institution of 

The word purohita is composed of puras before, and hita placed (from the root dhở); so paradhâta also; para is the Zend form of purâ before, which is equivalent to puras, and dháta is the Zend participle of the root dhd.xlviit a Purohita, who was not only a mere house-priest, but a political func tionary, goes back to that early period of history when the Iranians and Indians lived peacefully together as one pation. The Paradhatas of the Iranian kings appear however not to have been as successful in munking the Shahs of Iran their slaves, as the Indian Iurohitas wore in onslay ing the Indian Râjas in the bonds of a spiritual threl.lom. Ilow far the Brahmans must have succeeded in carrying out their design of a spiritual supremacy over the royal caste, every reader nay learn from this last chapter, and convince himself at the same time that hierarchical rulo was known in the world more than a thousand years before the foundation of the Sea of St. Peter. 

The ceremonial part of the last book is much onlivened by abort stories of kings who were said to have performes the " great inauguration ceremony," and of course attained to suprue rule over the whole earth (that is to say, of three or four Indian principalitie! It is an imitation of the ceremony by which the gods are said to have installed Indra to the sovereignty over them. The whole concludes (68) with the deseription of a magical performance (they are callen kritya) by means of which a king can destroy secretly all his enemies. 

After this summary statement of the contents of the Aitareya Brah maņam, the question arises whether the work in its present form is the composition of one author or of several. Although there is, as we have seen, a certain plan perceptible, in the arrangement of the subject matter, we may easily distinguish some repetitions, ditang-bigliammis anal interpola tions, which are hardly explicable is the book Itach ouly one author. So we find the Ajya hymn at the morning libation twico explained in 2, 40 and 41, but with slight differences; the origin of tho formula, agnir deveddhah is mentioned twice 2, 33 ans) 39, but in the former passage it is called Nivid, whilst in the latter the name "Puroruk" is given to it. The four last kandikis in the second book 38-41 appear to be a kind of appendix taken from some other sourco. The pieco 1,27 is identical with 7, 3; 6, 5 and 17 treat in the main of the samo topic, the relation between Stotriya and Anurûpa at the Ahina Macrifices. There are several repititions in the 8th book ; 80 the 13th hindiliis išlentical with the 18th and the 14th with the 19th. The 10th and 11th kanlikas in the seventh book are evidently interpolations, interrupting the context, and exhibiting a different style. The latter is very remarkable on account of its men tioning two other Vedic Sâkbås by their names, viz. Pusingy and *Kduşitaki; it appears to have appertained to an old troatise on astronomy.

[69] The style of the Brâbmaņam is on the whole uniform. There are certain phrases which constantly re-occur in the work, as for instance, "what is at the sacrifice appropriate, that is successful, when the verse (which is repeated) alludes to the ceremony which is being performed;" "(he who should observe a Hotar do so contrary to the precept) should tell him that the sacrificer would die; thus it always happens ;" "This is done for production (prajâtyâu)," &ç. The language is, of course, like that of all Brâhmaņas, more recent than that of the Sanhita ; but it is, however, not the classical Sanscrit. Purely Vedic forms occur, such as the infinitive forms in tos, e. g. karttos, arttos, roddhos, mathitos (tee 1, 10; 2, 20) generally dependent on išvara, i.e. able, who has the power, (iśvarah kartton he has the power to do; išvaro roddhoh, he has the power to obstruct, &c.), satartavái (from stri); stomebhir instead of stomớir (4, 15), &c. 

The bulk of the work appears to have proceeded from one author; some additions were made afterwards. As regards the materials which our author, whom we may (with Sâyana in various places of his con mentary) call the Aitareya Rişi, that is, the Rişi of the Aitareya Sakhâ of the Rigveda, used for the compilation of his work, we can principally distinguish four kinds, viz. (1) Sacred texts and formulas, such as the Adhrigu Praişa mantra (2, 6, 7), the Nivid (2, 34), &c., (70) which are, as we have seen, more ancient than the majority of the hymnş; 2 Gâthag i. e. stanzas, principally impromptus on sacrificial things, and topics.of a more wordly nature, and Itihasas, je stories ; (3) Rules on the performance of the duties of the Hotripriests; (4) Theological expositions of the meaning of mantras, sacred rites, &c., according to the teaching of the most ,eminent Brahma priests who preceded our author. 

These materials were worked together by him, but not without many additions of his own, and with the view to present to the followers of his Sakhâ a kind of encyclopedia of theological learning, and a supplement to their Veda. The theology of his Sakhá being founded ,on the hymns of the Rişis, and the latter being repeated by the Hotri priests only at the sacrifices, he confined himself for the most part to the speculations of the Hotris and their duties. The aim of our author was like that of all other Brâhmaņa compilers, a double one, viz. to 

* The phrase is always elliptical; it is only ya enam bruyat, if any one should tell -him; but the meaning of the whole phrase is only that one which is here (and in the translation) given. 

serve practical as well as theoretical ends. From a practical point of view it was to be a guide to the repeaters of the mantras of the Rigveda in some of their most important performances; but as regards the theoretical one, the author intenned to instruct them on the real ends of their profession, viz, to make the sacrificer, by means of the mystical power ascribed to the mantras, either attain to anything he might wish for, or if the Hotar should from some reason or other choose to do so, to deprive him through the same power of his property, children, and [71]life. The Hotris could learn from such a book how great their power was as the preservers of the sacred Rik verses. Every one who wished to perform a sacrifice as the only means for obtaining the favour of the gods, was entirely given up to the hands of the Hotsi-priests, who could do with him what they pleased. 

The mantras referred to are, for the most part, to be found in the Rigveda Samhitâ which we have at present. There are, however, several quoted, which are not to be met with in it, whence we must conclude, that the Samhita of the Aitareyins belonged to a Sakha different from that one (the Sakala Sâkhâ) which is at present only known to us. Asvaldyana, in his Srauta Sûtras, which are, as we have seen, founded on the Aitareya Brâhmanam, generally supplies the text of those mantras which are wanting in the Sam hitâ. Several of them are in the Atharvaveda Samhitâ, but they generally show different readings. In comparing both, those in the Ašvaldyana Sûtras, and those in the Atharvaveda Samhita, we find that, if there is any difference, the text of the Atharva is then always incorrect. It is remarkable that we do not only discover some relationship between the supposed Sakha of the Aitareyins and the Atharvaveda Samhita, but also between the Aitareya and Gopatha Brâhmaņam. Whole kandikâs of the Aitareya, such as those on the Vaşatkâra (3, 7-8) on Atirâtra (4, 5) are almost literally to be found in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇam of the Atharvaveda. 

The author's own additions consisted principally [72] in critical remarks, recommending certain practices, and rejecting others, statement of reasons, why a particular rite must be performed in a particular way, and explanations of apparent anomalies in the ritual. The author does never, however, speak in the first person ; for the whole he has the appearance of a tradition having descended from him. He is referred to only in the third person by the words, taddha smâha, "this he told." The theologians whose opinions are either accepted or rejected, are generally mentioned in the third person plural by the words "they say." Now 

and then they are called mahavadah, i.e. the speakers of great things. But their real name appears to have been Brahmavớdins, i. e. the speakers on Brahma (theologians, divines), which term we frequently meet in the Taittiriya Veda (Black Yajurveda.) 

The work was, like the other Brâhmaņas, no doubt, like the Samhitâi, orally handed down. Some external mark is still visible. At the end of each Adhyâya the last word, or phrase, is put twice. The same fact we observe in all other Brâhmaņas as well as in the Sûtras. This was evidently a mark for the repeater as well as the hearer by which to recognise the end of a chapter, each of which formed a little treatise for itself. 

Regarding the repetition of the Brâhmanam we have to remark, that it is done in a very slow tone, but quite monotonously, whilst the Brâhmaņas of the Yajurveda are recited with the proper accents. like the Samhitâs. Of very frequent occurrence in it is the pluti ie. the lengthening of a vowel to [78] three moras marked by a This Pluti is used in three cases, (1) to ask a question, (2) to deliberate or consider whether a thing should be done or not, and (3) to give some emphasis to a certain word. In the two first cases it expresses exactly the idea of our sign of interrogation, in the latter that of our underlining or 'italicising of certain important words. 

Let us make before we conclude some remarks on the principal sacrificial and theological ideas as far as they have not been touched already) which pervade the Aitareya Brâhmañana. 

The sacrifice is regarded as the means for obtaining power over this and the other world, over visible as well as invisible beings, animate as well as inanimate creatures. Who knows its proper application, and has it duly performed, is in fact looked upon as the real master of the world; for any desire he may entertain, if it be even the most ambitious, can be gratified, any object he has in view can be obtained by means of it. The Yajña (sacrifice) taken as a whole is conceived to be a kind of machinery, in which every piece must tally with the other, or a sort of large chain in which no link is allowed to be wanting, or a staircase, by which one may ascend to heaven, or as a personage, endowed with all the characteristics of a human body. It exists from eternity, and proced ed from the Supreme Being (Prajapati (Brahma) along with the Trai vidyd, 1. e. the three-fold sacred science (the Rik verses, the Såmans or chants, and the Yajus or sacrificial formulas). The creation of the world [74] itself was even regarded as the fruit of sacrifice performed by the 

Supreme Being. The Yajña exists as an invisible thing at all times, it is like the latent power of electricity in an electrifying machine, requiring only the operation of a suitable apparatus in order to be elicited. It is supposed to extend, when unrolled, from the Ahavaniya or sacrificial fire into which all oblations are thrown, to heaven, forming thus a bridge or ladder, by means of which the sacrificer can communicate with the world of gods and spirits, and even ascend when alive to their abodes. The term for beginning the sacrificial operations is "to spread the sacri fice ;" this means that the invisible thing, representing the ideal sacri fice which was lying dormant, as it were, is set into motion, in conse quence of which its several parts or limbs are unfolding themselves, and thus the whole becomes extended. This ideal sacrifice stands in the closest relationship with all the sacrificial in plements, the sacrificial place, and all the sacred verses and words spoken during its actual perfor mance. The sacrifice being often represented as a kind of being with a body like that of men, certain ceremonies form his head, others his neck, otbers his eye, &c. The most important thing at a sacrifice is that all its several parts should tally together, and that consequently there should neither anything be in excess, nor deficient in it. This agreeing of the several parts of the sacrifice constitutes its rúpa i. e. form. The proper form is obtained, when the mantras which are repeated are in [75] strictest accordance with the ceremony for which they are repeated, or (if the sacrifice lasts for several or many days) when they have the cha racteristics of the respective days. If the form is vitiated, the whole sacrifice is lost. Mistakes being, on account of the so extremely com plicated ritual, unavoidable, the sacrificial being was to be attended by a physician in the person of the Brahina priest (5, 34). Each mistake must be made good by a prayaschitta, .e. penance, or propitiatory offering. 

The power and significance of the Hotri-priests at a sacrifice consists in their being the masters of the sacred word, which is fre quently personified by Vâch i.e. Speech, who is indentical třith Saras vati, the goddess of learning in the latter Hindu Pantheon. Speech has, according to the opinion of the earliest Hindu divines, the power of vivifying and killing. The sacred words pronounced hy the Hotar effect, by dint of the innate power of Vâch, the spiritual birth of the sacrificer, form his body, raise him up to heaven, connect him with the prototypes of those things which he wishes to obtain (such as children, cattle, &c.) and make him attain to his full life term, which is a hundred years; but they are at the same time a weapon by means of which the sacrificer's enemies, or he himself (if the Hotar have any evil 

1111 

designs against him) can be killed, and all evil consequences of sin (this is termed påpman) be destroyed. The power and effect of Speech as regards the obtaining of any particular thing wished for, mainly lies in the form in which it is uttered. Thence [76] the great importance of the metres, and the choice of words and terms. Each metre is the invisible master of something obtainable in this world; it is, as it were, its ex ponent, and ideal. This great significance of the metrical speech is derived from the number of syllables of which it consists ; for each thing has, (just as in the Pythogorean system) a certain pumerical pro portion. The Gâyatri metre, which cansists of three times eight syllables, is the most sacred, and is the proper metre for Agai, the god of fire, and chaplain of the gods. It expresses the idea of Brahma ; therefore the sacrificer must use it when he wishes for anything closely connected with the Brahma, such as acquirement of sacred knowledge, and the thorough understanding of all problems of theology. The Triştubb, which consists of four times eleven syllables, expresses the idea of strength, and royal power; thence it is the proper metre by which Indra, the king of the gods, is to be invoked. Any one wishing to obtain strength and royal power, principally a Kşattriya," must use it. A variety of it the Uşņih metre of twenty-eight syllables, is to be employed by a sacrificer who aspires for longevity, for twenty-eight is the symbol of life. The Jagati, a metre of forty-eight syllable, expresses the idea of cattle. Any one who wishes for wealth in cattle, must use it. The same idea (or that of the sacrifice) is expressed by the Pankti metre (five times eight syllables). The Bțihatî, which consists of thirty-six syllables, is to be used when a sacrificer is aspiring to fame and renown for this metre is the exponent [77] of those ideas. The Anuştubh metre, of thirty-two, syllables, is the symbol of the celestial world ; thence a candidate for a place in heaven has to use it. The Virâj of thirty syllables, is food and satisfaction; thence one who wishes for plenty of food, must employ it. 

The words contained in these different metrical forms must always be appropriate to the occasion. If the oblation is given to Agni, the perse repeated must contain his name, or an allusion to it; were it to contain the name of Indra, or one of his characteristics, the offering would be thrown away. Every act, even the most trifling one, is at the sacrificial performance accompanied with mantras, and always such a verse is to be chosen as contains (or is made to contain by interpretation) an allusion to it. This will all be clear to the reader on reference, for instance, to 2, 2, where the mantras connected with every particular act of the ceremony of anointing and erecting the sacrificial post is given. 

liv 

Of almost equal is portance with the metres are the so-called Stomas, based also on numerical proportions. Fach Stoma contains a certain number of verses, chanted according to one and the same tune. The number is very often obtained only by frequent repetition of the same triplet of verses (see about the particulars of the Stomas note 18 on pages 237-38 of the translation). Each has, just as the metres, its peculiar symbolical meaning. The Trivrit (nine-fold) stoma, is, for instance, the symbol of Brahma, and the theological wisdom, and has Agni, the house priest of the gods, for its deity: the Panchadasa (fifteen-fold) is the (78) symbol of royal power and thence appropriate to Indra, and the Kşat triyas: the Saptadasa (seventeen-fold) is the exponent of wealth in cattle ; thence a Vaisya should use it, or any other sacrificer who wishes to obtain wealth: the Ekaviméa-(twenty-one-fold) is the symbol of generation : thence it is principally to be used at the third libation, many rites of which refer to the propagation of progeny. The other Stomas, such as the Trinava (twenty-seven fold), Trayastrira'a (thirty-three-fold), &c, have a similarly symbolical meaning. 

Besides the Stomas, the so-called Pristhas the name of certain Sâmans and their combinations) are a necessary requisite at all the Soma sacrifices. They form the centre of all the ceremonies, and the principal one of them is always regarded as the womb (yoni) of the sacrificial being. They are generally only used at the midday libation. The two principal Prişthas are the Rathantara and Brihat Samans (abhitvà súra nonums, and trâmiddhi havâmahe). They can be used singly, or along with one of their kindred (see notes 29 on page 193, 14 on page 282, and 4, 28). The name Priştha means “back," for they are regarded on the whole as the back of the sacrifice. 

All these things, metres (chhandas), Stomas and Pristhas, are believed to be as eternal and divine, as the words themselves they contain. The earliest Hindu divines did not only believe in a pri mitive revelation of the words of the sacred texts, but even in that of the various forms, which might be used for their repetition or chanting. These forms along with their contents, [79] the everlasting Veda words, are symbols expressive of things of the invisible world, and in several respects comparable to the Platonic ideas. They are in the hands of the sacrificial priests the instruments for accomplish ing anything they might wish for in behalf of the sacrificer. But a great deal depends upon the way of using those spiritual instruments. It is a matter of importance whether a mantra is repeated without stopping, 

or påda by pada.(quarter by quarter), or half verse by half verse. The four feet (pâdas), of which many metres are composed, represent the four feet of animals. The repetition of such a verse, half verse by half verse, that is, with two stops only, represents the sacrificer who as a human being, has two legs. By thus combining the ideas of four and two-footed beings, the sacrificer is mystically placed amidst cattle, and obtains them, in future, in the largest quantity. Another important point is, whether the mantra is repeated upamću, i.e, with an almost inaudible voice, or túsnim, .e. silently, or with a low and slow voice (mandrasvara), or with a middle tone (madhyama), or very loud (utiama). (See 3, 44). 

Among the large number of the sacred words, there are always some which have a destructive quality, and must, therefore, be used with great caution. In order to protect the sacrificer, as well as himself, from the dangerous effects of such words, the repeater must, by means of certain other words, or formulas, deprive them of their destructive power, and thus propitiate them. This is generally called sûnti [80] (propitiation, appeasing). Such dangerous words are for instance, våuşat (see 3, 8) and rudra, the name of Siva, the god of destruction (3, 34). 

The sacrificer, who is the object of all these mystical operations on the part of the priests) by means of their mantras, chants, and manual labour, is not allowed to remain inactive, but he himself has to repeat certain mantras, expressive of his desires. When, for instance, the Hotar is performing the mystical operation of placing him among cattle, he must say, “May I become rich in cattle!” When the same priest makes a firm standing place (a pratişthá) for him, he must say, “May I go to my place ! " Thus he obtains the fulfilment of any desire which might be obtainable by means of a particular verse or mode of repeating, or chant, or performance of a particular rite, when he repeats the appro priate formula at the right time and occasion. For what he himself speaks, connects him with the ideals of his wishes, which are brought within his grasp by the priest. 

The objects sacrificed for are manifold, viz. Offspring, cattle, wealth, fame, theological learning, skill for performance of sacrifices, and heaven. For gaining heaven a Soma sacrifice is indispensable. For the sacred Soma juice has, according to the opinions of the ancient Hindu theo logians, pre-eminently the power of uniting the sacrificer on this earth with the celestial king Soma, and make him thus one of his subjects, and consequently an associate of the gods, and an inhabitant of the celestial world.

AITAREYA BRAHMANAM OF THE RIGVEDA. 

## 01
FIRST BOOK 

### 01
FIRST CHAPTER (ADHYAYA). 

(The Dikşaniya Işti, with the Initiatory Rites.) 

Agni, among the gods, has the lowest, Vişnu the highest, place; between them stand all the other deities. 

Så yana, whom M. Muller follows in his translation of the first six chapters of the first book, as given in his “History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature" (pages 390-405), explains the words avama and parama by * first" and "last." To prove this meaping to be the true one, Sâyana adduces the mantra (1.4. Asyal. Sr. S. 4, 2), agmir mulcham prathamo devatanim samgatánam uttamo Vişnur asït, i.e., Agui was the first of the deities assembled, (and) Vişnu the last. In the Kauşitaki-Brâhmanam (7, 1) Agni is called avarárdhya (instead of avama), and Vişgu parárdhya (instead of parana), n.e., belonging to the lower and higher halves (or forming the lower and higher halves). That the meaning "first” cannot be reasonably given to the word avama, one nay learn from some passages of the Rigveda Samhita, where avana and purama are pot applied to denote rank and dignity, but only to mark place and locality. See Rigveda 1, 108, 9, 10 : avarasyám prithiúyám, madhyamasyan, para musyam uta, i.e., in he lowest place, the middle (place), and the highest (place). Agni, the fire, has, among she gods, the lowest place ; for he resides with man on the earth; while the other gods are either in the air, or in the sky. Vişnu occupies, of all gods, the highest place ; for he represents (in the Rigveda) the sun in its daily and yearly course. In its daily course it reaches the highest point in the sky, when passing the zenith on he horizon; thence Visiu is called the " highest" of the gods. Sâyana understands I first" and " last" in reference to the respective order of deities in the twelve iturgies (sastra) of the Soma day at the Agnistoma sacrifice. For, says be “The Irst of these liturgies, the so-called Ajya-Sastra (see 2, 31), belongs to Agni, and in he last out of the twelve, in the so-called Agnamaruta sastra (see 3, 92-38), there is ne verse addressed to Vişnu. But this argument, advanced by Sayaga, proves Jothing for his opinion that " Agni is the first, and Vişnu [2] the last deity;" for hese twelve liturgies belong to the fifth day of the Agnistoma sacrifice, whilst the Sikşanîya-isti, in connection with which ceremony the Brahmanam makes the remark(kapala). They offer it (the rice-cake) really to all the deities of this (Isti, without foregoing any one." For Agni is all the deities, and Vişnuis all the deities. For these two (divine) bodies, Agni and Vişnu, are the two ends 5 of the sacrifice. Thus when they portion out the Agni-Vişņu rice-cake, they indeed make at the end & (after the ceremony is over) prosper? (all) the gods of this (ceremony). 

[4] Here they say: if there be eleven potsherds on which portions of the rice-cake are put, and (only) two deities, Agni and Vişnu, what arrangement is there for the two, or what division ? 

(The answer is) The rice-cake portions on eight potsherds belong to Agni; for the Gayatrê verse consists of eight syllables, and the Gâyatri is Agni's metre. The rice-cake portions on the three potsherds belong to Vişņu; for Vişņu (the sun strode thrice through the universe, This the arrangement (to be made) for them; this the division. 

* Anantarayam : literally, without any one between, without an interval, the chain of the gods being uninterrupted. 

Antye. Så yana opines that this adjective here is ekašesa, ie, that out of two or more things to be expressed, oply one has aetually remained. It stands, as he thinks, instead of adya'and antya, just as pitariu means "father and mother." (Pâdini, 1, 2, 70.) 

* Antatan, Sây, sat the beginning and end of the sacrifice," But I doubt whether the term implies the beginning also. In the phrase: untatah pratitistati, which so Irequently occurs in the Ait Brahm., antatah means only “ultimately," at the end of a particular ceremony or rite. 

* Ridhnuvanti. Sây. paricharanti, they worship. He had, in all probability, Nighanta 3,5, in view, where this meaning is given to ridhnoti. But that this word conveys the sense of “prospering" follows unmistakeably from a good many passages of the Sanhita of Rigveda and Manu. (See the Sanskrit Dictionary by Böhtlingk and Roth 5. V. and Westergaard's Radices Banscrita s. v. 4. page 182.) In this passage the meaning "to worship," as given by Sayana, is too vague, and appears not quite appro priate to the sense. On account of its governing the accusative, we must take it here in the sense of a transitive ferb, although it is generally an intransitivo one. The mean ing which lies nearest, is, - to make prosperous." At the first glance it might appear somewhat curious, how men should make the gods prosperous by sacrificial offerings. But if one takes into consideration, that the Vedas, and particularly the sacrificial rites inculcated in them, presuppose a mutual relationship between wen and gods, one depending on the support of the other, the expression will no longer be found strange. Men must present offerings to the gods to increase the power and strength of their divine protectors. They must, for instance, inebriate Indra with Soma, that he might gather strength for conquering the demons. The meaning " to satisfy, to please," which is given to the word “ sidhnuvanti" of the passage in question in Böhtlingk's and Roth's Dictionary, is a mere guess, and wholy antenable, being supported by no Brahmanik authority 

* This refers to the verse in the Rigveda Samhita 1,22,17,18: idam Vinnur vichakrame tredha nidadhe padam, i.e., Vişņu strode through the universe; he put down thrice his foot; and trini padā vichakrame, he strode three steps. These three steps of Vipp. who represents the sun, are: sunrise, zenith, and sunseta 

He who inight think himself to have no position (not to be highly respected by others) should portion out (for being offered) Charu over which clarified [5] butter is poured. For on this earth no one has a firm footing who does not enjoy a certain (high) position. The clarified butter (poured over this Charu) is the milk of the woman; the husked rice grains (tandula of which Charu consists) belong to the male ; both are a pair. Thus the Charu on account of its consisting of a pair of female and male parts) blesses hin with the production of progeny and cattle, for his propagation (in his descendants and their property). He who has such a knokledge propagates his progeny and cattle. 

He who brings the New and Full Moon oblations, has already made a beginning with the sacrifice, and made also a beginning with (the sacri ficial worship of the) deities. After having brought the New or Full Moon oblations, he may be inaugurated in consequence of the offering made at these (oblations) and the sacrificial grass (having been spread) at these (oblations, at the time of making them). This (might be regarded) as one Dikşâ (initiatory rite).12 

Churu is boiled rice. It can be mixed with milk and butter; but it is no essential part. It is synonymous with odanam, the common term for “boiled rice." Katap Brah. 4, 12, 1. There were different varieties of this disb ; some being prepired with the addition of barley, or some other grains. See Taittîriya Samh. 1, 8, 10, 1. 

(5) * Pratitistati, which is here put twice, has a double sense, viz., the original meaning "to have a firra footing, standing," and a figurative ono "to have rank, position, dignity" In the latter sense, the substantive pratisthi is of frequent occurrence Dignity and position depend on the largeness of family, wealtà in cattle, &c. 

The present followers of the Vedık religion, the so-called Agnihotris, who take upon themselves the performance of all the manifold sa crificial rites enjoined in the Vedas, begin their arduous career for gaining a place in heaven, after the sacred fires have been established, with the regular monthly performance of the Darsa and Púr 11 maisti or the New and Full Moon sacrifices. Then they bring the châturnêsya-isti, and after this rite they proceed to bring the Agnistoma, the first and model of all Soma sacrifices By the bringing of the New and Fall Moon offerings, the Agnihotri is already initiated into the gränd rites; he is already an adept (Diksita) in it. Some of the links of the yajna or sacrifice which is regarded as a chain extending from this earth to heaven, by means of which the successful performer reaches the celestial world, the seat of the gods, are already established by these offorings; with the deities, whose associate the sacrificer wishes to become after his death, the intercourse is opened; for they have already received food (havin), prepared re according to the precepts of sacred cookery, at his hands, and they have been sitting on the sacred seat (barhis) prepared of the sacri-i fcial grass (Darbha). Thence the performance of tbe Full and New Moon sacrifices is here called one Dikşa, i.e., one initiatory rite But if the Agnihotri, who is performing a Soma sacrifice, is already initiated (Diksitu) by means of the rites just mentioned, how does he require at the opening of the Agnistoma (Soma-sucrifice) the so-called Diksaniyo. Fşti, or "offering for becoming initiated"? This question was mooted already in ancient times. Thence, says Ašvaláyana in his Srauta sûtras (4, 1), that, some are of opinion, the Soma-sacrifice should be performed, in the case of the means required being forthcoming 

[6] The Hotar must recite seventeen verses for the wooden sticks to be thrown into the fire!? (to feed it). For Prajapati (the Lord of all creatures) is seventeenfold; the months are twelve, and the seasons five, by putting Hemanta (winter) and Sisira (between winter and spring) as one. So much is the year. The year is Prajâ pati. He who has such a knowledge prospers by these verses (just mentioned) which reside in Prajapati. 

[7] The sacrifice went away from the gods. They wished to seek after it by means of the Iştis. The Istis are called Istis, because they wished (ish, to wish) to seek after it. They found it. He who has such a knowledge prospers after he has found the sacrifice. The name ahutis, ie, oblations, stands instead of âhúti, i e., invocation ; with them the sacrificer calls the gods. This is (the reason) why they are called âhutis. They (the dhutis) are called útis; for by their means the gods come to the call of the sacrificer (@yanti, they come). Or they are the paths (and) ways; for they are the ways to heaven for the sacrificer. 

There they say, as another priest (the Adhvaryu) offers (juhoti) the oblations, why do they call that one, who repeats the Anodkyâ and Yâjyd verses, a Hotar? (The answer is) Because he causes the deities to be brought near (âvâhayahti), according to their place, (by saying) "bring this one, bring that one."'13 This is the reason why he is called a Hotar (the sacrifice is very expensive), after the Full and New Moon sacrifices have been brought; others opine the Soma sacrifice might be performed before the Fall and New Moon sacrifices. No doubt, the Agniştoma was in ancient times a sacrifice wholly independent of the Darsa Pârnimi-istis. This clearly follows from the fact, that just such Iştis, as constitute the Full and Vew Moon sacrifices, are placed at the beginning of the Agniştoma to introduce it. 

12 These verses are called Sámidhenis. They are only eleven in number; bot by repeating the first and last yerses thrice, the number is brought to fifteer. They are mentioned in Âśval. Sr. S 1, 2; several are taken from Rigveda 3, 27, as the first (pra vo vájā abhidyavo) fourth (samudhyumána) 13th, 14th, and 15th (ilenyo) verses. Besides these three, Ašv. mentions : agna äydhi vitaye 6, 16; 10, 12, three verses), ugnim dútum vrinimahe (1, 12, 1.), and samiddho agna 5, 28, 5, 6, two verses). They are repeated monotonously without observing the usual three accents. The nunber of the samidhenis is generally stated at fifteen; but now and then, seventeen are mentioned, as in the case of the Dilşa niya işti. The two additional mantras are called Dhiyyí, i.e,, verses to be repeated when an additional wooden stick, after the ceremony of kindling is over, is thrown into the fire, in order to feed it. They are mentioned in Sayana's commentary on the Rigveda Samhitâ, vol. II., page 762 (ed. M. Muller). S. Ašval. 4, 2, two Dbâyyås at the Diksanîya isti. 

[7] 1$ At every Işti, the Hotar calls the particular gods to whom rice-cale portions are to be presented, by their names to appear. At the Dîkşanîya Isti, for instance, he says : agna agnim avaha, vişnum avuha, 1.6., Agni! bring hither Agnis! bring hither Visnu. The name of the deity who is called near, is only muttered, whilst ávaha is pronounced with a loud voice, the first syllable à being pluta, i.e., containing three short a. See Abv śr. S. 1, 3. 

(from @vah, to bring near). He who has such a knowledge is called a Hotar.14 

[8] The priests make him whom they initiate (by means of the Díkşâ ceremony) to be an embryo again (i.e., they produce him anew altogether). They sprinkle him with water; for water is seed. By having thus provided him with seed (for his new birth), they initiate him. They besmear him with fresh butter (navanîta). The butter for the gods is called âjya, 15 that for men surabhi ghritam, that for the manes dyuta. and that for the embryos navanita. Therefore by anointing him with fresh butter, they make him thrive through his own portion. 

They besmear his eyes with collyrium. For this anointment is lustre for both eyes. By having imparted lustre to him, they make him a Dikşita. 

They rub him clean with twenty-one handfuls of Darbha grass. By having thus made pure and clean they make him a Dikşita. 

• They make bim enter the place destined for the Dîkşita.16 For this is the womb of the Dikşita. [9] When they make him enter the place destined for the Dikṣita, then they make him thus enter his own womb. In this (place) he sits as in a secure abode, 17 and thence he 

14 These etymologies of işti, áhuti, úti, and hotâ are fanciful and erroneous. The real root of işti is yaj, to sacrifice; that of âhuti is hu, to briog an offering; that of úti is av, to protect, to assist; that of hotá is hvé, to call. The technical meaning of an isti is a series of oblations to differeut deities, consisting chiefly of Purodása. An áhuti or úti, which appears to be an older name of the same idea (this meaning is quite omitted in the Sanscrit Dictionary by B. and R), is an oblation offered to one deity. This oblation is generally accompanied by two mantras, the first being called the Anivákya or (81 Puro anuvákya, the second Yáyd. When the second is recited, the oblation is thrown into the fire by the Adhvaryu. The Hotar repeats only the mantras. 

15 To remind his readers of the difference existing between ajya and ghrita, Sây. quotes an ancient versus memorialis (Karika), sarpir vilínam ayam syât ; ghanibhůtam ghritam viduh, i.e., they call the butter, which is in a liquid condition, ágya, and that one which is hardened is called ghệita. Ayuta is the butter when but slightly molten, and. surabhi when well seasoned. According to the opinion of the Taittirîyas, says Sa yana, the butter for the gods is called ghȚita, that for the manes astu, and that for men mispakva. Astu is the same as áyuta, slightly molten, and nispalva, the same as ájya, entirely molten. 

14 Diksita-vimita. It is that place which is generally called prâchîrä vansa (or pråg-vamsa). This place is to represent the womb which the Dîksita enters in the shape of an embryo to be born again. This is clearly enough stated in the Brahmana of another såkhân, which Så yana quotes : a granaataja R a fagast: a . 

(9) " Såyaņa takes the three ablatives--tasmád, dhruvad, yoner, in the sense of loca tives ; but I think this interpretation not quite correct. The ablative is chosen on account of the verb charati, he walks, goes, indicating the point, whence he starts. The other verb date, he sits, would require the locative. Therefore we should expect both 

departs. Therefore the embryos are placed in the womb as a secure place, and thence they are brought forth (as fruit). Therefore the sun should neither rise nor set over him finding him in any other place than the spot assigned to the Diksita ; nor should they speak to him (if he should be compelled to leave his place). 18 

They cover him with a cloth. For this cloth is the caul (ulba) of the Dikşita (with which he is to be born, like a child); thus they cover him with the caul. Outside (this cloth) there is (put by them) the skin of a black antelope. For outside the caul, there is the placenta jarayu). Thus they cover him (symbolically by the skin of the antelope) with the placenta. He closes his hands. For with closed hands the embryo lies within (the womb); with closed bands the child is born. As he closes his hands, he thus holds the sacrifice, and all its deities in his two hands closed. 

They allege as a reason (why the Dîkşita should close together both his hands) that he who takes (among two who are sacrificing on the same place and at the same time) his Dikşâ (initiation) first, is not guilty (of the sin) of “confusion of libations" (sansava). 18 For his sacrifice and the deities are held [10] fast (in his hands); and (consequently) be does not suffer any loss like that which falls on him who performed his Dikş& later. 

After having put off the skin of the black antelope he descends to bathe. 

Thence embryos are born after they are separated from the placenta. He descends to bathe with the cloth (which was put on him) on. Thence a child is born together with the caul. 

The Hotar ought to repeat for him who has not yet brought a sacrifice two Püronuvâkyâ verses, tvam agne saprathâ asi (Rig-veda Samhita 5, 13, 4) for the first, and Soma yás te mayobhuvah (1, 91, 9) for the second portion of (the offering of) melted butter, (By reading the third pâda of the first verse tvayê yajnam “through thee (thy favour) they 

cases, locative and ablative On account of conciseness, only the latter is chosen, but the former is then to be understood. 

26 For performing, for instance, the functions of nature.--Sáy 

19 If two or more people offer their Soma-libations at the same time, and at places which are not separated from one another, either by a [10] river, or by a mountain, then a sañsava " or confusion of libation is caused, which is regarded as a great sin. He, however, who has performed his Díkşâ first, and holds the gods between his haads, is not guilty of such a sin, and the gods will be with him.---Sdy. 

extend 20 the sacrifice," the Hotar extends thus the sacrifice for him (who has not yet brought a sacrifice). 

For him who has brought a sacrifice before, the Hotar has to recite (two other mantras instead): agnih pratnena manmană (8, 44, 12) and Soma gîrbhiş ţvá vayam (1, 91, 11). For by the word pratnam, i, e., former (which occurs in the first verse), he alludes to the former sacrifice. But the recital of these verses (for a man who has performed a sacrifice, and for one who has not done so) may be dispensed [11] with. Let the Hotar rather use the two verses which refer to the destruction of Vritra (vár trughna), viz., Agnir vritrâni janghanat (6, 16, 24), and, tvam soma aşi satpatiḥ (1, 91, 5). Since he whom the sacrifice approaches, destroys Vșitra (the demon whom Indra conquers), the two verses referring to the destruction of Vșitra are to be used. 21 

The Anuvákyd for the Agni-Vişnu-offering is : Agnir mukham prathamo devatânâm, the Yâjyâ: agniścha Vişno tapa.") These two verses (addressed) to Agni and Vişņu are corresponding (appropriate) in their form. What is appropriate in its form, is successful in the sacrifice ; that is to say, when the verse which is recited refers to the ceremony which is being performed. 

(Now follows a general paraphrase of the contents of these two verses) Agni and Vişnu are among the gods, the "guardians of the Dikşa” (that is to say), they rule over the Dikşâ. When they offer the Agni 

20 Vitanunte. The sacrifice is regarded as a kind of chain which, when not used, lies rolled up; but which when being used, is, as the instrument for ascending to heaven, to be wound off. This winding off of the sacrificial chain is expressed by the term vitan, to extend Connected with this term are the expressions vitana and vartånika. 

[11] 21 The verses mentioned here are the Puronuvíkyås, i, e., such ones as are to be recited before the proper Anuvalya with its Ya, ya is to be repeated. The Puro-anuvák yás are introductory to the Anuväkya and Yaya. 

22 Both verses are not to be found in the Sakala Sakha of the Rig-veda, but they are in Âśval Saruta Sätras 4, 2. I put them here in their entirety: 

अग्निमुखं प्रथमो देवतानां संगतानामुत्तमो विष्णुरासीत् । यजमानाय परिगृह्य देवान् दीक्षयेदं हविरागच्छतं नः॥ अग्निश्चविष्णो तप उत्तम महो दीक्षापालाय वनतं हि शक्रा । 

विश्वैर्देवैयज्ञियः संविदानी दीधामस्मै यजमानाय धत्तम् ॥ [12] ie, “Among the deities assembled, Agui, being at the head, was the first, and Vişậu the last (god). Ye both, come to our offering with the Dîk:a, taking (with you all) the gods for the sacrificer! (i.c., come to this offering, and grant the Dîkså to the sacrifi cer). Agni and Visņu! ye two strong (gods)! burn with a great heat to the utmost (of your power) for the preservation of the Dîkså. Joined by all the gods who participate in the sacrifice, grant, ye two, Dikså to this sacrificer." Agni and Visņu, the one repre senting the fire, the other the sun, are here invoked to burn the sacrificer, by combination of their rays, clean, and to purify him from all gross material dross. The Dîkşâ should be made as lasting as a mark caused by brapding. 

Vişnu oblation, then those two who rule over the Dikşå become pleased, and grant Dikşâ, that is to say, the two makers of Dikşa, they both make the sacrificer a Dikşita. These verses are in the Triştubh metre, that the sacrificer might acquire the properties of the god Indra (vigour and strength). 

[12] He who wishes for beauty and acquisition of sacred knowledge should use at the Sviştakrit%3 two verses in the Gayatri metre as his Samnyâjyás. For the Gayatri is beauty and sacred knowledge. He who having such a knowledge uses two Gayatris 24 (at the Sviştakrit) becomes full of beauty and acquires sacred knowledge. 

He who wishes for long life, should use two verses in the Uşnih metre; for Uşnih is life. He who having such a knowledge uses two Uşņihs 25 arrives at his full age (i.e., 100 years). 

He who desires heaven, should use two Anuştubhs. There are sixty-four syllables in two Anustubhs. 26 Each of these three worlds (earth, air, and sky) contains twenty-one places, one rising above the (13] other (just as the steps of a ladder). By twenty-one steps he ascends to each of these worlds severally ; 27 by taking the sixty-fourth step he stands firm in the celestial world. He who, having such a knowledge, uses two Anustubhs, gains a footing (in the celestial world). 

He who desires wealth and glory, should use two Brihatîs. For among the metres the Brihati 28 is wealth and glory. He who, having such a knowledge, uses two Brihatis, bestows upon himself wealth and glory. 

He who loves the sacrifice should use two Panktis,29 For the sacrifice is like a Pankti. It comes to him who having such a knowledge uses two Parktis. 

He who desires strength should use two Triştubhs. Triştubh is · strength, vigour, and sharpness of senses. He who knowing this, uses. two Triştubbs, becomes vigorous, endowed with sharp senses and strong. 

23 The Svistakrit is that part of an offering which is given to all gods indiscrimi nately, after the principal deities of the respective Isti (in the Dilşaniya Istr, these deities are Agni, Soma, and Agni-Visuu) have received their share. The two mantras required for the Svistakrat are called Sarzya ya. On account of the general nature of this offering, the choice of the mantras is not so much limited as is the case when the offering is to be given to one particular deity. 

* They are, sa havyavál amartyah (3, 11, 2), and Agnir hotâ purohitah (3, 11, 1). 15 They are, agne vajasya gomatal (1, 79, 4), and sa idháno vasuş havih (1,70,5). ** Tram agne vasún (1, 45, 1, 2). 3* This makes on the whole 63 steps. 

They are, ena vo agnim (7, 16, 1), and udadya sochih (7, 10, 3). 39 Agnim tam manye (5, 6, 1, 2). 

Due virûpe charathah (1.95, 1, 2, 

He who desires cattle should use two Jagatís (verses in the Jagati metre) 31 Cattle are Jagati-like. He who knowing this, uses two Jagatis, becomes rich in cattle. 

He who desires food (annadya) should use two verses in the Viraj metre.32 Viraj is food. Therefore he who has most of food, shines (via rajati) most on earth. This is the reason why it is called viraj (from vi-rdj, to shine). He who knows this, shines [14] forth among his own people, (and) becomes the most influential man among his own people. 

6. The Viraj metre possesses five powers. Because of its consisting of three lines (pâdas), it is Gayatri and Uşnih (which metres have three lines also). Because of its lines consisting of eleven syllables, it is Tris tubb (4 times 11 syllables=44). Because of its having thirty-three syllables, it is Anustubh. (If it be said, that the two Virâj verses in question, i.e., preddho agne and imo agne have, the one only 29, and the other 32 syl lables, instead of 33, it must be borne in mind that) metres do not change by (the want of) one syllable or two83. The fifth power is, that it is Viráj. 

He who knowing this, uses (at the Sviştakrit) two Virâj verses, ob tains the power of all metres, gains the power of all metres, gains union, uniformity, and (complete) unison with all the metres.34 

Therefore two Viraj verses are certainly to be used, those (which begin with) agne preddho 17, 1, 3), and imo agne (7, 1, 18). 

Diksâ is right, Dikşâ is truth ; thence a Dikşita should only speak the truth. . 

Now they say, what man can speak all truth ? Gods (alone) are full of truth, (but) men are full of falsehood. 

(15] He should make each address (to another) by the word, “vichak sana," i e.," of penetrating eye." The eye (chakşus) is vichakşaña, for with it he sees distinctly (vi-paśyati). For the eye is established as truth among men. Therefore people say to a man who tells something, 'Hast thou seen it ?' (i.e., is it really true ?) And if he says, “I saw it," then they believe 

31 They are, janasya gopa (5. 11, 1, 2). 39 They are, preddho agne (7, 1,3), and imo agne (7, 1, 18). 

[14] 33 In the first verse quoted, there are even 4 syllables less than required. The Brahmanam is not very accurate in its metrical discussion. The Apustubh has 32 sylla bles. 

* The meaning is, by using two Viráj verses which contain the principal metres, he obtains collectively all those boons which each of the several metres is capable of bestowing upon him who uses them. So the Gâyatrî, for instance, grants beauty and sacred knowledge, the Tristubh strength, &c (See above). The metres are regarded as deities. He who employes them becomes pervaded, as it were, by them, and participates in all their virtues and properties, 

him. And if one sees a thing himself, one does not believe others, even if they were many. Therefore he should add (always) to his addresses (to others) the word vichakşana, 35 * of penetrating, sharp eyes.” Then the speech uttered by him becomes full of truth. 


### 02
SECOND CHAPTER. 

Práyaniya Işti. 

The Práyaniya işti has its name "práyanîya'l from the fact that hy its means the sacrificers approach heaven (from pra-yâ, going forward). The práyaniya [16]ceremony is the air inhaled (prâna), whereas the uda yaniya, i e, concluding ceremony (of the whole sacrifice) is the air exhaled. The Hotar (who is required at both ceremonies) is the common hold of both the airs (samâna). Both the air inhaled and exhaled are held together (in the same body). (The performance of both ceremonies, the prayanîya and udayanîya are intended) for making the vital airs, and for obtaining a discriminating knowledge of their several parts (prana, udang, &c.)? 

The sacrifice (the mystical sacrificial personage) went away from the gods. The gods were (consequently) unable to perform any further cere mony. They did not know where it had gone to. They said to Aditi : Let us know the sacrifice through thee ! Aditi said : Let it be so ; but I will choose a boon from you. They said : Choose ! Then she chose this boon: all sacrifices shall commence with me, and end with me. Thence there is at the beginning of) the prdyaniya işti a Charn-offering for Aditi, 

[15] ". This explanation of the term vichaksa iza refers to the offering of two parts of melted butter (See chapter 4, page 10), which are called choksusi, i.e., two eyes. The sacrificer obtains in a symbolical way new eyes by their means to view all things in the right way. The Diksita ought to use the term vichakşa1 a after the name of the person who is addressed ; for instance, “Devadatta Vichaksana, bring the cow. According to Apastamba, this term should be added only to the names of a Ksatriya and Vaisya ad dressed; in addressing a Brahmana, the expression chana sita sbould be used instead.- Sáy, 

1 TOT : The masculine is here used, instead of the feminine, rasta : is, as Sây. justly remarks, to be supplied. The common name of this ceremony is Právaniya isti. The Brâhmanam here attempts at giving an explanation of the terms prayaniya and udayaniya. 

[16] 2 The Prâ yapiya ceremony is here regarded as the proper commencement of the ya, na; for the Dîkşanîyâ işti is only introductory to it. The beginning is compared to the prina and the ned to the udana, both which vital airs are held together by the samana. The Brahmana mentions here only three präras or vital airs. Two others, vyûna and apana, are omitted. This mystical explanation can be only understood if one bears in mind that the yana or sacrifice itself is regarded as a spiritual man who shares all properties of the natural man.12 

and the same offering is given to her as the boon chosen by her at the end (of the sacrifice). Then she chose this (other) boon. Through me you shall know the eastern direction, through Agni the southern, through Soma the western, and through Savitar the northern direction. The Hotar repeats the (Anuvâkyå and) Yâjyâ-mantra for the Pathya 3 (17) Therefore the sun rises in the east and sets in the west; for it follows in its course the Pathya. He repeats the (Anuvâkyâ and) Yâjyâ verse for Agni. 

That is done because cereals first ripen in southern countries 5 (for Agni is posted at the southern direction); for cereals are Agni's. He repeats the (Anuvâkyå and) Yâjyâs for Soma. That is done, because many rivers flow towards the west (to fall into the sea), and the waters are Soma's. He repeats the (Anuvákyâ and) Yâjya? mantra for Savitar, That is done, because the wind (pavamânaḥ) blows most from the north between the northern and western directions ; it thus blows moved by Savitar. 8 

He repeats the (Anuvákya and) Yajya ' mantra (18) for Aditi, who is the upper region.10 This is done, because the sky (asâu) wets the earth with rain (and) dries it up (which is done from above). He repeats (Anuvákya and) Yâjyá verses for five deities. The sacrifice is five-fold. All (five) 

• The two verses addressed to Pathya are Rigveda 10, 63, 15, 16, svastir nah pathyásu (see Nirukti' 11, 45). These verses are mentioned in Âýval. Śr. 8Q, 4, 3. The word yajati is an abbreviation (17) for anvhâa yajaticha, iner, he repeats the Anuvákyà (first) and Yâjyê (second) mantra when an offering is given. Sây. notes from another sakha the passage : qezi feat Yafa staha et feqi s ata i.e., he (the Hotar) recognises the eastern direction by repeating the Yajya verse addressed to Pathya Svasti, i.e., well-being when making a journey, safe pas sage. According to Sâyaga, Pathya is only another name of Aditi. She repre sents here the line which connects the point of sunrise with that of sunset. 

* These are, agne naya supatha 1, 189, 1, and a devándm api panthâm 10, 2, 3. 

* Sky, states that in the north of the Vindhya mountains chietty barley and wheat are cultivated, which ripen in the months of Mâgha and Phálgunce (February and March), whilst in the coantries south from the Vindhyâ (ie, in the Dekkban) rice prevails, which ripens in the months of Kartika and Margusirsa (November and December). 

* They are : tuam soma prachikitô munisa, 1, 91,1, and ya te dhämâni divi 1, 91, 4, See 1, 9, Âśv, Sr. S. 4, 3. 

- They are : â višvadevam satpatim 5, 82, 7, and ya ima viśvá jatani 5, 82, 0. 

• Sây. explains Savitar as, Torea: a moving, inciting god. 

* These are sutrâmá nam prithivim 10, 63, 10, and mahîm u sút mataram. Atharva Veda 7, 6, 2. 

[18] Lo Sây. explains uttamá, by urdhvá, referring to a passage of the Taittirîya Veda : M eita ( 9FT). There is no doubt, the word can mean the upper region, but one would not be quite wrong in translating here the word by "last." For Aditi is here the last deity invoked. 

Ahow word yajati is an 11, 45). These mothyd are Rigveda in an 

13 

directions are (thus) established ; 11 and the sacrifice becomes also estaba lished. It becomes established for such people (only) with whom there is a Hotar having this knowledge (to separate and mark the regions in this way). 

He who wishes for beauty and acquirement of sacred knowledge, should turn towards the east when making the offerings for the Prayája deities. 12 For the eastern direction is beauty and sacred knowledge. He who baving this knowledge turns eastward (when making the Prayâjas) obtains beauty and sacred knowledge. 

He who wishes for food, should turn towards the south when making the offerings for the Prayaja deities. For Agni (who is posted at the southern direction) is the eater of food, and master of food. He who having this knowledge goes towards the south (when making the Prayâjas) becomes an eater [19] of food, a master of food; he obtains nourishment along with offspring 

He who desires cattle, should go towards the west when making the Prayâja offerings. For cattle are the waters (which are in the western direction). He who having such a knowledge goes westwards becomes rich in cattle. 

He who desires the drinking of the Soma, should go towards the north when making the Prayâja offerings. For the northern direction is the king Soma. He who having such a knowledge goes northwards (when making the Prayâjas) obtains the drinking of the Soma. 

The upper direction (ürdhvá) leads to heaven. He who performs the Prayâja offerings when standing in the upper direction 1 becomes success ful in all directions. For these (three) worlds are linked together. They being in such a condition shine for the welfare of him wbo has such a knowledge.

speech (represented by Pathya) at the beginning of the sacrifice. The breath (coming out of the mouth and the nostrils) is Agni; the breath (being within the mouth and nostrils) is Soma. Savitar is to set into motion (the ceremonial machinery), and Aditi is to establish a firm footing. When he repeats a Yâjyâ to Pathyâ, then he carries the sacrifice on its path. Agni and Soma verily are the two eyes ; Savitar serves for moving it, and Aditi for establishing a firma footing (to it). For through the [20] eye the gods got aware of the sacrifice. For what is not perceivable (elsewhere) is to be perceived by the eye. If any one even after having run astray gets aware (of any thing) by exerting his eye successively 15 (in consequence of the successive exertions of the faculty of seeing), then he (really) knows it. When the gods (were exerting their eyes repeated ly, and 'looking from one object to the other) they got sight of the sacrifice. Thus they got sight of it on this earth ; on the earth (therefore) they acquired the implements (required for performing the sacrifice). On her (the earth) the sacrifice is spread; on her it is performed ; on her the sacrificial implements are acquired. This earth is Aditi; therefore the last Yâjyâ verse repeated is addressed to her, This is done (in order to enable the sacrificer) to get aware of the sacrifice (the mystical sacrificial man) and to behold afterwards the celestial world. 

They say, the gods should be provided with Vaisyas 18 (agricul turists and herdsmen). For if [21] the gods are provided with them, men 

[21] 16 Ånuştya is explained by Sày.:att garagtay. It no doubt, literally means, one standing by the other, one after the other. The substantive anuşthana is the most general word for performance of a religious ceremony, being a succession of several acts. The meaning given to the word in Bohtlingk and Roth's Sanskrit Dic tionary (I. page 124) “with his own eyes," is nothing but a bad guess unsupported by any authority and contrary to etymology and usage. The phrase anuştya prajánáti properly means, he gets aware of the chief object after having got sight of an inter mediate one which alone leads to the first. The sacrificer whose principal object is to reach heaven, must first see the medium by means of which he can ascend to the celestial world. This is the sacrifice. Therefore he first sees the sacrifice and then he casts a glance at the celestial world. A traveller who has run astray, must first recognise the direction, and then he may find the way to his homely village. 

16 According to Sayaņa, the word visah may convey two meanings: 1. a subject in general; 2, men of the Vaisya caste I prefer the latter meaning. The Vaisyas are to provide gods and men with food and [21] wealth. They are bere evidently regarded as the subjected population The gods are, as Sây. states with reference to the creation theory of the Vâjasaneyins, divided into four castes, just as men, Agni and Brihaspati are the Brâhmaṇs among the gods; Indru, Varuna, soma, the Rudras, Parjanya, Yama Mrityu are the Ksatriyas ; Ganesa, the Vasus, the Rudrus, the Adityas, Visvedevas and Marutas are the Vaisyas, and Púgan belongs to the Sadra caste. 

15 

subsequently obtain them also. If all Vaidyas (to furnish the necessary supplies) are in readiness, then the sacrifice is prepared. It is pre pared for that family in the midst of which there is a Hotar who has this knowledge and makes provision accordingly). 

(The gods are provided for with Vaisyas by the recital of the verse, svastinaḥ path yâsu : 17 10, 63, 15), “O Maruts! grant us in the desert tracks prosperity (by providing us with water) ; grant us prosperity (by abundance) in waters in a desolated region over which the sky shines! grant prosperity to the wombs of our women for producing children ! grant prosperity to our wealth." For the Maruts are the Vaidyas of the gods (their agriculturists). The Hotar puts them by (repeating) this (mantra) in readiness at the beginning of the sacrifice. 

They say, the Hotar should (as Anuvákyâ and Yâiyi verses at the Prâyaniya işti) use mantras of all (principal) metres. For the gods conquered the celestial world by means of having used for their (Anuvákyâ and) Yüjyû verses inantras of all metres. Likewise, the sacrificer who does the same gains the celestial world. The two verses) svasti nah pathyâsu and svastir* iddhi prapathe (10, 63, 15, 16), which are addressed to path yâsvasti, i.e., safe journey, are in the Triştubh metre. The two verses addressed to Agni, agne naya supathd (1, 189, 1), and a devanan api pantham (10, 2, 3), [22] are also in the Triştubh metre. The two verses, addressed to Soina, tvam amos prachikito manişå (1, 91, 1), and yo te dhamani divi (1, 91, 4) are (also) in the Tristubh metre. The two verses addressed to Savita : å visvadevam satpatim (5, 82, 7), and yâ imâ visvá (5, 82, 9), are in the Gayatri metre. The two verses addressed to Aditi, sutrâmânam přithivim 

(10, 63, 10), and mahin û şu mataram (Atharv. 7, 6, 2), are in Jagatî metre,18 These are all the (principal) metres : Gâyatrî, Triştubh, and Jagati. Those (other metres) follow them. For these (three kinds of metres) are, as it were, of the most frequent occurrence (pra tamam) at a sacrifice. He, therefore, who having such a knowledge gets repeated his Anuvâkyâ and Yâjyâ verses in these (three) metres, gets repeated them in all metres (obtains the particular advantage to be derived not only from the three metres mentioned, but from all other metres also). 

1* See the 3rd note above, page 16. The translation of the whole is given io the context. 

18 All the Anuvlikya and Yájyá verses required for the five deities (see 1, 7), of the Práya niya işti are here mentioned. 

16

10 *These verses used as Anuvâkyâs and Yâjyâs at this offering (the Prayaņîya Işti), contain the words, pra, forward, forth ni,2o to carry; pathin,2l path ; svasti, 22 welfare. The gods after having per formed an Işti by means of these verses, gained the celestial world. Likewise, a sacrificer, after having done the same, gains the celestial world. Among these verses there is a pada (a foot, here the last quarter verse of 10,63, 15): "O Maruts! grant prosperity in wealth." The Maruts are the Vaisyas (the subjects) of the gods, and are domi [23] ciled in the air. (By these words just mentioned) the sacrificer who goes to heaven is to be announced to them (the Maruts). For they have the power of preventing him (from going up) or even of killing him.. By the words, "O Maruts! grant prosperity," &c., the Hotar announces the sacrificer (his projected journey up to the celestial world) to the Vaisyas (the subjects) of the gods. The Maruts then neither prevent nor kill him who goes to the celestial world. He who has such a knowledge, is allowed a safe passage up to the celestial world by them. 

The two Samyäjyd verses required for the Sviştakrit (of the Prayanîya-iştz) ought to be in the Virâj metre, which consists of thirty-three syllables. These are : sed agnir agnimr (7, 1, 14) and sed aynir yo (7, 1, 15). The gods after having used for their Samyâjyds two verses in the Viraj metre, gained the celestial world. Likewise does that sacrificer gain heaven who uses also two verses in the Viraj metre (when performing the Sviştakrit of the Prdyaniya işti). They (each of them) contain thirty-three syllables. For there are thirty three gods, viz., eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, (one) Prajapati, and (one) Vaşat-kâra. In this way, the Hotar makes the gods participate at the very first beginning of the sacrifice in the (33) syllables of the mantra recited ; for each syllable is (as it were) a plate 23 for the gods, by which the sacrificer makes (all) deities pleased and satiates them. 

11 

They say, at the Prayanîya isti are (only) the Prayája 24 offer

ings to be made, but not the Anuya [24] jas , 25 for the latter are, as it were, a blank, and (if performed) cause delay. But tbis (precept) should not be observed ; at the said Işçi both, the Prayâja as well as the Anuyaja offerings should be made. For the Prayâjas are the vital airs, and the Anuyâjas are offspring. When he thus foregoes the Prayâjas, he foregoes the vital airs of the sacrificer (deprives him of his life), and when he foregoes the Anuyâjas, he foregoes the offspring of the sacrificer (deprives him of it). Thence Prayâjas as well as Anuyajas are required (at the Prayaņiya işti). 

He should not repeat the Samyaja mantras addressed to the ladies 28 (patnis, of the gods) ; nor should be use the Sansthita-Yajus27 formula. Only inasmuch as this is done (i.e., if the Patni-samyâjya and Saństhita Yajus offerings are omitted), the sacrifice is complete.28 

He should keep the remainder of the Prâyanîyła-ist offering and after the Soma sacrifice is over) mix it together, with the offering required for the Udayaniya (concluding) işti, in order to make the sacrifice one continuous uninterrupted whole. There [25] is also another way for connecting both Iştis). In the same vessel, in which he portions out the rice for the Purodâ sa of the Prâyaniya işti, be should portion out also the rice for the Purodása of the Udayaniya işti. Inasmuch as this is done, the sacrifice becomes continuous, uninterrupted. They say, in doing this the sacrificers succeed in that the other) world, but not in this one, They use the expression Prâyaņiyam (on several occasions). For, on the several portions of rice being taken out for the Puroda da (by the Adhvaryu), the sacrificers say this is Prayaniya (i.e., to go forth, to pro gress), and on the Purodása oblations being thrown into the fire), they say again, this is Prayanîyam (i e., to progress). In this way, the sacrificers go forth (Prayanti) from this world. But they say so from ignorance and this: objection is consequently not to be regarded.) 

The Anuvâkyâ and Yêjyâ verses of both the Prầyaniya and Odúyaniya iştis should interchange in this way, that the Anuvâkyà verses of the 

[24] * In the common Istis there are generally three Anuyažas, or oblations of clarified butter, after the Sristakrit ceremony is over. The deities are : devam barhis (the divine seat), deva narásarsa, and deua agni sviştakrit. See Âšv. &r. 8. 1, 8. The present practice is to leave out the Aouyâjas at the Prâyapiya işti. 

** These mantras, which are addressed to several deities, chiefly the wives of the gods, are called, Patni-sarnyájás. These women are : Raka, Siniväli (full moop), and Auhů and Anumati (new moon). Io the Aśv. Sr. S. 1, 10 Anumati is omitted. 

21 The last Yajus like mantra which is recited by the Hotar at the close of the işti. See Aøv. 6r. S. 1, 11. 

38 The usual concluding ceremonies of the Isti are to be dispensed with at the Priyaniya, in order to connect it with the other parts of the sacrifice. 

18 

Prâyaniya işti should be used as the Yâjyâ verses for the Udayaniva, and the Yâjyâ verses of the Prậyaņiya as Anuvâkyâs of the Udayaniya. The Hotar shifts in this way (the Anuvâkyâs and Yajyâs of both the Istis) for ensuring success (to the sacrificer) in both worlds, for obtaining a firm footing (for the sacrificer) in both worlds. The sacrificer (thus) succeeds in both worlds, and obtains a firm footing in both worlds. He who has this knowledge, obtains a firm footing (in both worlds). The Charu oblation which is given to Aditi at the Prâyaņia as well as at the Udâyaniya isti serves for holding the sacrifice (at both its ends) together, to tie the two knots of the sacrifice (at the beginning and at the end), in order to prevent it from slīpping down. Some one (a theologian) has told : this [26] (tying of the two ends of the sacrifice) is exactly corresponding to that (act of common life to which it alludes); as (for instance) one ties two knots at both the ends of a rope (tejanih), in order to prevent (the load which is tied up) from slipping down. In the same way, the priest ties the knots at both ends of the sacrifice (the sacrificial chain) by means of the Charu oblation given to Aditi at the Prâyaniya as well as at the Udayapiya işti. Among those (deities required at both the Iştis) they commence with Pathya Svasti (at the Prảyaņia işti), and conclude (at the Udâyanîya işti) also with Pathyâ Svasti. (Thus) the sacrificers start safely from here, and end (their journey there, in the other world), they end safely, safely (their journey there, in the other world).

THIRD CHAPTER. The Buying and Bringing of the Soma. The Producing of Tire 

by Friction. The Atithyâ Tşti. 

12. The gods bought the king Soma in the eastern direction. Thence he is (generally) bought in the eastern direction. They bought him from the thirteenth month. Thence the thirteenth month is found unfit (for any religious work to be done in it); a seller of the Soma is (likewise) found un fit (for intercourse). For such a man is a defaulter. (When the Soma, after having been bought, was brought to men (the sacrificers), his powers and his faculty of making the senses sharp moved from their place and scattered everywhere. They tried to collect and keep them [27] together with one verse. But they failed. They (tried to keep them together; with two, then with three, then with four, then with five, then with six, then 

1 Diso is to be taken as an ablative depending on the verb vyudasidan, literally, they were upset (and scattered) everywhere. The preposition ut in this verb mainly requires the ablative.

with seven verses ; but they did not succeed in keeping them together. (Finally) with eight verses they succeeded, and recovered them (in their entirety and completeness). (Therefore) what is held together and obtained, that is called aştai, i.e. eight (from aś to reach, obtain). He who has this knowledge obtains anything he might wish for. Thence there are in those ceremonies (which follow the bringing of the Soma to the sacri ficial compound), eight verses, each time recited, in order to collect and hold together the strength and those qualities (of the Soma plant) which give sharpness of senses. 

13. The Adhvaryu then says (to the Hotar) : repeat a mantra for the Soma who is bought and being brought (to the sacrificial compound). The Hotar repeats : Bhadråd abhi śreyah prehi, i.e., go from (28) happiness to still greater bliss. By the word bhadra, 2.e., happy, this world (the earth) is meant. That world is better (śreyán) than this world. Thus the Hotar makes the sacrificer go to the celestial world (which is to be understood by śreyas, i e, better). (The second pada of the verse is): brihaspatih pura eta astu, i.e., the (thy) guide be Brihaspati ! If the Hotar has made by repeating this pada) the Brahma his (the sacrificer's) guide, (the sacrifice) being thus provided with the Brahma will not be damaged. (The third pada of the verse is :) atha im avasya vara â prithivya, i.e., stop him (Soma) on the surface of the earth. Vara means the place for sacrificing 

7 The mantra is from the Taittiriya Samhita, We find it also in the Atharvaveda Samhita (7, 8, 1.) with some deviations, which are found alike in the printed edition and in an old manuscript which is in my possession. The verse reads in the Aitarey. Brahm, and Taittir. Samk. as follows:- . 

भद्रादभि श्रेयः प्रेहि बहस्पतिः पुर एता ते अस्तु । 

प्रथेमवस्य वर श्रा पृथिव्या भारे शचन् कृणुहि सर्ववीर: ॥ Instead of there is an in the A. V, and instead of. ( 1 gael) there is RAFT (979 I SÅ ) ; instead of the plur. T we have the sing. TT, and instead of poetry there is prett. There is no doubt that the readings of the Atharva Veda look like corrections of the less intelligible parts of the original mantra. which is correct only in the forma in which we find it in the Ait. Br. and the Taitt. S. is less correct than me. The redactor of the A. V. chose it on account of the so ex. tremely frequent combination of a with an ablative which generally precedes (see the large number of instances quoted in B, and R.'s Samskrit Dictionary I. pp. 142, 143), whilst 21 never governs an ablative, but rather an accusative, and is in this passage to be connected with श्रेयः The words : अथेममस्या are a bad substitute for अथेममस्य. The term avusya “ make an end, do away with him ' (the enemy) was entirely misunderstood by the : . dactor. Asya he makes asya and refers it to airer ! The nominative gaatt: which 

fers only to the deity invoked is made an accusative and referred to 179777, which then came a singular, TT. 

20 

to the gods (devayajana). (By these words) the Hotar makes him (the Soma) stop (and remain in that place). (The fourth pada is :) dre satrún krinuhi sarvavirah, i.e., endowed with all powers, drive far off the ene mies! (By reading these words) the Hotar turns out the enemy who does injury to the sacrificer, and his adversary, (aud) consigns him to the lowest condition. 

The Hotar then repeats the triplet : soma yds te mayobhuvah (1, 91, 9-11), which is addressed to Soma, and is in the Gayatri metre. In this way the Hotar makes the king Soma flourishing when he is being brought (to the sacrificial compound) by means of his own deity (the verse being addressed to [29] Soma himself), and his own metre (his favourite metre being the Gâyatri. 3) (The Hotar re peats :) sarvet nandanti yaśasa (10, 71, 10), i.e., "all friends rejoice at the arrival of the friend crowned with fame for having remained victor in the learned discussion (sabha); for as their (of his friends) protector from defects, and giver of food, he is fit and ready for provid ing them with strength.” * (Now follows the ex [80] planation): Yaśaḥ, 

3 The Gâyatri is said to have assumed the shape of a bird, and brought the Soma from heaven Thence this metre is sacred to him. 

"Say, understands by "the friend,” Soma, and by the friends, who rejoice at the friend's arrival," the priests and the sacrificer. About the same meaning he gives to the verse in his commentary on the Rigveda Samhitâ. There he explains peta:, friends, by FATOSTAT: being equal in knowledge. he refers to “all men of the assembly." qur he takes in the sense of an adjective onar. But it is very doubtful whether this verse had originally any reference to Soma. In the whole hymn (Eura arer $0.) of which it forms the eleventh verse, there is nowhere any allusion made to Soma. According to the Anukramanî, the hymn is “seen" (composed) by Brihaspati, the son of Angiras. But this appears to be very unlikely; for Brihaspati himself is addressed in the vocative. Say. gets over the difficulty by asserting that Brihaspati (the teacher of the Gods and the receptacle of all sacred knowledge) is addressing these words to himself, after having had revealed the meaning and bearing of the Veda, before he ventured upon communicating the revelation (to the Gods). To judge from the contents of the hyon, the author prays to Brihaspati who is the same with Váchaspati, the god of eloquence and speech, to ondow bim with the power of giving utterance in the proper words to his feelings, of which only the best ones should be revealed (v. 1). There is an interesting simile to be met with in the 2nd verse : "when the wise made the speech through their mind, purifying it (through their thoughts), just as they purify barley juice (saktu) through a filterer (titau)." Saštu is a kind of beer prepared by pouring water over barley, and by filtering it after having allowed it to remain for some time in this state. The whole hymn, in which the name “ brahmana" (as that of a caste, is several times mentioned, appears to refer to the might of speech and the great succetas to be derived from it when engaged in sacrificing. 

The priests live on the presents which are given to them by the sacrificers. Hence the Soma, who is indispensable for the sacrificer, and who is to be administered in the proper way by priests only, is their giver of food'22 

evil), as one who gives good children and does not hurt them in any way).” 

The words gayasphána, pratarana, suvirah mean: be an increaser and protector of our cattle. Dürych means the premises (of the sacrificer) which are afraid of the king Soma having arrived. When the Hotar repeats this (last pada of the verse), he does it with a view to propitiate him (Soma). If the Hotar has thus propitiated him (the Soma), he neither kills the children nor the cattle of the sacrificer. 

The Hotar concludes with the verse, addressed to Varuņa: imdm, dhiyam sikşamünasya deva . (8, 42, 3), i.e., “O divine Varuņa, instruct the pupil in understanding, performance, and skill. May we ascend [32] the ship for crossing safely all evil waters and land in safety (on the other shore)." Soma is in the power of the god Varuņa, as long as he is tied up in the cloth)," and goes to the places of the Pragvamśa. When reciting this verse, he thus makes the Soma prosper by means of his own deity (for as liquor he is Varunî), and his own metre. 8 The “pupil” (learner, is he who sacrifices, for he is learning. By the words "instruct in understanding, performance, and skill, "he means, teach, 0 Varuna, strength (and) knowledge. The "ship " is the sacrifice. The ship is of “ good passage " The black goat-skin is the "good passage,” and speech the ship. By means of this verse the sacrificer thus ascends speech (as his ship) and sails in it up to the celestial world. 

These eight verses which he repeats, are complete in form. What is complete in form, that is successful in the sacrifice, when the verse repeated alludes to the ceremony which is being performed. 

Of these verses he repeats the first and last thrice; this makes twelve (in all). The year consists of twelve months, and Prajâpati is the year. He who has this knowledge succeeds by these verses which reside in Prajâpati. By repeating the first and last verses thrice, be ties the two end knots of the sacrifice for fastening and tightening it, in order to prevent it from slipping down. 

14 One of the bullocks (which carry the cart on which the king Soma is seated) is to remain yoked, the other [33] to be 

* The Sowa stalks are to be tied up in a cloth, when they are brought to the sacri ficial compound, the front part of which, including the Abavaniya, Dakşıyâ and Garhapatya fires is called, Praguansu or Prichana-vansa. 

*This is Triştubh. According to another Sakhâ, as Sây. says, this metre (very likely in the shape of a bird, as the Gayatrí is said to have assumed) went to heaven to abstract the Soma, and brought down the Dakşiņa (sacrificial reward), and the internal concentration of the vital powerg (the so-called tapas). See Ait, Brah 3,25. 

unyoked. Then they should take down (from the cart) the king (Soma). Were they to take him down when both are let loose, they would bring him into the power of the manes (pitarah). Would they do so, when both are still yoked (to the cart), the sacrificer could not keep what he is possessed of, nor increase it; should he have any children, they would be scattered (everywhere, and consequently be lost for him). The bullock which is let loose, represents the children who are in the house, that one which remains yoked, the actions (ceremonies, and worldly pur suits). Those sacrificers who take the Soma down, whilst one of the bullocks is yoked and the other let loose, avail themselves of both actions, of acquiring property, and keeping what they have acquired. 

The Devas and Asuras were fighting in these worlds. They fought in the eastern direction; there the Asuras defeated the Devas. They then fought in the southern direction, the Asuras defeated the Devas again. They then fought in the western direction, the Aşuras defeated the Devas again. They fought in the northern direction, the Asuras defeated the Devas again. They then fought in the north-eastern direc tion, there the Devas did not sustain defeat. This direction is aparajita, i.e., unconquerable. Thence one should do work in this (north-eastern) direction, and have it done there ; for such one (alone) is able to clear off his debts. 10 

The Devas said, it is on account of our having no king, that the Asuras defeat us. Let us elect a king, [34] All consented. They elected Soma their king. Headed by the king Soma, they were victorious in all directions. He who brings the sacrifice is the king Soma. The Soma faces the eastern direction, when the priests put him (on the cart). By this means the sacrificer conquers the eastern direction. The priests turn the cart round in the southern direction. By tbis means he conquers the southern direction. They turn (the cart) towards the west; by this means he conquers the western direction. When the cart stands in the northern direction, they take (the Soma) off. By this means he conquers the northern direction. He who has this knowledge conquers all directions. 

NOVEL 

After the king Soma has arrived, the reception offering is pre pared. For the king Soma comes to the premises of the sacrificer 

It is called âisani, i e., the direction of isanah, who is siva.. 120 According to the Brahmanical notions, every man born is a debtor. His creditors are the gods, Rişis, the Pitaras, and men. His debt towards the Pitaras or manes, is cleared off by begetting a son. As long as he has begot no son, he is debtor to the manes. To clear his debts towards the gods by offering sacrifies to them, he must bave some property. Any act required for the acquisition of anything, should be done in the north-eastern direction, 

24 

(as a guest). Thence the offering for receiving him as a guest (atithis is called Atithyn-işti. Its Purodása is made ready in nine potsherds (i. e., the rice ball, making up the Purodása is placed on nine potsherds). For there are nine vital airs (prânah). (This offering is made) for making the vital airs (to the sacrifice) and for making them severally known. It belongs to Vişnu; for Vişņu is the sacrifice. . By means of his own deity and his own metre 11 he makes the sacrifice successful. For all metres and Pristhas, 12 [35] follow the king Soma, when he is bought (as his retinue). To all who follow a king (as his retinue) a reception is given. 

When the king Soma has arrived, then they produce fire by friction. Agni being the animal of the gods, this rite of producing Agni (and throwing him into another fire) is equivalent to the slaughter of an ox or a cow which miscarries, which rite is always performed when a king or another man who deserves high honour 13 is to be received. 

16. The Adhvaryu (says to the Hotar); repeat mantras for Agni, who is a being produced by friction, 

The Hotar repeats a verse addressed to Savitar: abhi tvi deva Savitar (1, 24, 3). They ask : why does he repeat a verse addressed' to Savitar for the Agni, who is being produced ? (The answer is :) Savitar rules over all productions. Produced 14 (themselves) by Savitar, they are able) to produce Agni (by friction). Thence a verse addressed to Savitar is required. 

He repeats a verse, addressed to Dyâvd-prithivi: mahî dyâuh pri thivicha na (4, 56, 1.) 

(36) They ask : why does be repeat a verse addressed to Dyåvå-prithivi for Agni. who is being produced (by friction)? They answer: the gods 

1 The Anuvâkyå mantra is, idum Vis nur vichakrame (1, 22, 17) and the Yâjyâ, tad asya priyam abhipátho (1, 154, 5), See Asval, Sr. S 4, 5. Of both verses Vişnu is the deity. The metre of the first verse is Gayatri, that of the second, Trişçubh. These two metres are regarded as the principal ones, comprising all the rest. 

32 A Pristha is a combination of two verses of the Sâmareda. Some of the principal Samans are in the Triştubh or Gayatri metre. These two metres represent all others. 

13 The term is arhat, a word well-known chiefly to the students of Boddhism Sayana explains it by "a great Brâhman," or a Brahman (in general). That cows were killed at the time of receiving a most distinguished guest, is stated in the Smritis. But, as Sâyana observes (which entirely agrees with the opinions held now-a-days), this custom belongs to former Yugas (periods of the world.). Thence the word : goghna, i en, cow killer means in the more ancient Samskrit books "a guest": (See the commentators on Panini 3, 4, 79); for the reception of a high guest was the death of the cow of the house. 

24 Sâyaņa explains prasúta as "allowed, permitted." According to his opinion, the meaning of the sentence is, “having been permitted by Saritâ to perform this ceremony, they perform it." Prasava is then “the permission for performing ceremonies," But I 

i lm thin oninion is correct.

caught him (once), when he was born, between heaven and earth (dyâod prithivt); since that time he is kept there enclosed (by heaven and earth). Thence the Hotar repeats a verse addressed to Dyârâ-prithivi. . 

• He repeats a triplet of verses addressed to Agni in the Gayatri metre : tram Agne puşkarâd adhi (6, 16, 13), wben Agni is being pro duced. Thus he makes him (Agni) prosper by his own deity (the verses are addressed to Agni) and his own metre (Gayatrí). The words, atharva niramanthata, 15 i.e., the fire-priest produced thee out (of the two wooden sticks by means of friction), are complete in form. 

What is complete in form, (that is) when the verse which is repeated alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, that is successful in the sacrifice. 

Should Agni not be born (the fire not be produced), or should it take a long time, then the Raksogni 18 verses, which are in the Gayatri metre are to be repeated : Agne hamsi nyatrinam (10, 118). These (verses) are intended for destroying the Râkşasas (the evil-doers). For the Râkşasas have seized him, if he is not born, or if his birth is delayed. 

When Agni is born after the recital of the first or the second (and so on) of these (Rakşogni verses), then the Hotar has to repeat a verse appropriate to him, who has been born, by containing the term " born," uta bruvantu jantava (1, 74, 3.) 

What is appropriate in the sacrifice, that is successful. He repeats : å yan hastena khadinam (6, 16, 40). 

[87] In this verse occurs the term “hasta, hand;" for they rub him (out of two wooden sticks) by means of their hands. In it there further occurs : śiśur-játah, i.e., a child born; for, just as a child, he is first born. The word na (in na bibhrati of the verse) has with the gods the same meaning as om (yes) with these (men). He repeats, pra devan devavîtaye (6, 16, 41). This verse is appropriate for Agni when he is being thrown into the Ahavaniya fire (after having come out of the two wooden sticks). The half verse, a sve yonâu nişîdatu (which are contained in this verse), 1. e, he may sit in his own house, means, that Agni (the Ahavaniya fire) is Agni's (who was just born by friction) proper place. 

In the verse : jätam jätavedasi (6, 16, 42), the one is jäta (the Agni produced by friction), the other patavedás (the Ahavaniya fire). The words, priyam šišitha atithim mean, Agni (the new born) is the beloved gues of the (other) Agai (the Abavaniya). By the words, syona d grihapatim, he, the priest, places him at ease (by putting him into his 

** They occur in the first verse of the triplet mentioned. * Verses calculated to kill the Raksas who are preventing Agai from being born. 

26 

proper place, the Ahavaniya fire). Agnindgnih samidhyate (1, 12, 6) is: appropriate (when the new born Agni has been thrown into the Ahavaniya fire). In the verse: tvam hyagne agninâ vipro viprena santsatá (8, 43, 14). the one vipra (wise) means one Agni, and the other vipra, the other Agni; the one san (being, existing) means the one, the other san in (satd) the other Agni. The words, sakha sakyâ samidhyase (at the end of the verse quoted) mean, this Agni is the friend of the (other) Agni. 

In the verse : tam marjayanta sukratum (8, 73, 8), the words, svežu kşayeşu, mean, this Agni is the other Agni's own residence. 

With the verse, ya jñena yajñam ayajanta (1, 164, 50), he concludes. By means of the sacrifice (the ideal omnipresent sacrifice) the gods thug (38) performed (the actual, visible) sacrifice. By having sacrificed Agni through Agni (having thrown the new born Agni into the Ahavaniya fire), the gods went to heaven. (In the remaining part of the verse)" these (producing fire, &c.) were the first rites; the great ones (the sacrificers) reached that heaven in which those gods who formerly performed the same rites reside" (1, 164, 50), the metres are the sadhyâ devâs, ie, the gods who (formerly) performed. They sacrificed Agni at the beginning by means of Agni, and went to heaven. There were the Adityas, and the Angiras. They sacrificed at the beginning Agni by means of Agni and went to heaven. The offering of the fire (Agni) is that offering which leads to heaven. Even if the performing priest is no proper Brahman" (in the strictest sense), or even pronounced to be an ill-reputed man, this sacrifice nevertheless goes up to the gods, and becomes not polluted by contagion with a wicked man (as in this case the per forming priest is). The oblation (of Agni in the Ahavaniya fire) of him who has this knowledge goes up to the gods; and does not become in fected by contagion with a wicked man.. .The verses he repeats are thirteen in number; they are complete in form. If the form is complete and the verse alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, then the sacrifice is successful. Of these [89] verses he repeats the first and the last thrice; this makes seventeen. 

1. The term in the original is, abrahmaroktu, i e., who is deelared to be no proper Brahman. According to Sây. there are in the Smritis six kinds of men mentioned who are, strictly speaking, not capable of the Brahmanship, though they are Brahmans by birth, viz., the servant of a king, a merchant (seller and bayer); the bahuyaji, he who performs many sacrifices (for the sake of gain only); the aś rauta-yâjaka, i.e., he who being properly appointed for the performance of the great (Srauta) sacrifices, performs only the less important domestic rites (smárta-karmáini); the grâmayai, i.e., he who performs out of covetousness alone sacrifices for all inhabitants of a village or town qualified or disquali fied; the brahmabandhu, 1. e., he who performs the daily religious duties neither before sunrise nor sunset. 

27 

For Prajâ pati is seventeen-fold, comprising such a year as consists of twelve months and five seasons. Prajapati is the year. 

He who has such a knowledge prospers by these verses which reside in Prajapati. By repeating thrice the first and last verses he ties both the knots of the sacrifice to fasten and tighten it, and prevent it from slipping down. 

(The Remaining Rites of the Atithi-işti, 18 after the Ceremony of Pro ducing Fire by Friction is finished). 

The two Puro-anuvâkyâs for both portions of melted butterko (which are to be offered) are, samidhâgnim duvasyata (8, 44, 1), and apyayasva sametu (1, 91, 16.) These two verses are complete in form ; for they contain an allusion to guests.20 When the verse (which is repeated) alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, then the form is complete, and (consequently) the sacrifice successful. The verse (8, 44, 1) alluding to the guest (atithi) belongs to Agni, whilst the verse addressed to Soma (1,91, 16), does not contain the word " guest." If there were a verse addressed to Soma, containing the word "guest," such one should always be used. But notwithstanding (there being no such verse) the verse mentioned (1, 91, 16) refers to a guest, for it contains the term "being fattened";" for, when one feeds a guest [40] (well), then he grows fat, as it were. The Yâjyâ mantra for both, Agni and Soma, commences with juşdnah.21 The Apuvákyâ and Yâjyâ mantras (for the principal offering consisting of Purodaśa) are idar Vişnupal vichakrame (1, 22, 17) and tad asya priyam abhi pâtho (1, 154, 5). Both verses are addressed to Vişgu. Having repeated as Anuvâkyâ a verse with three padas, he uses as Yâjyâ one consisting of four padas; thus seven padas are obtained. 

For the ceremony of receiving a guest (atithyam-atithi-işti) is the head of the sacrifice. There are seven vital airs in the head. By this ceremony the Hotar thus puts the seven vital airs in the head of the sacrificer). 

· The two Samyâjyâ mantras, required at the Sviştakpit are: hotaram chitraratham (10, 1, 5), and pra prayam agnir (7, 8, 4). Both verses are 

1See the Taittiriya Samhita 1, 2, 10, and Sây.'s commentary on it, vol. i., pp. 370-384, ed. Cowell. Âbval. Śrâuta S. 4, 5. 

1. These two parts are the so-called chakşusi, i.e., eyes of the Işti, which always precede the principal offering, consisting of Purodası. 

20. In the words of the second pada of sami dhágnim, viz., ghritaih bodhaya to atithim, refresh the guest with clarified butter drops ! 

» Juşáno agnir ajyasya vetu; juşano Soma djyasya vetu: may Agni pleased, eat the melted butter, &c. 

12 The Purodása is given to Vişnu who is the chief deity of this Isti. 

28 

complete in form ; for in both the word atithia, a guest (referring to Agni's reception as a guest) occurs. The success of the sacrifice depends on the completeness of the form, i.e., that the mantra (which is repeated) alludes to the ceremony which is being performed. Both Samyâjyás (used at the Sviştakrit of the Atithi-işti) are in the Triştubh metre, for getting possession of Indra's powers (for Indra is Triştubh). The cere mony ends here with the eating of the sacrificial food.24 The gods having (oncel rested [41] satisfied with the Atithya-işți ending by the eating of the sacrificial food (on the part of the sacrificer and the priests), this Iəti is to end with the eating of the sacrificial food (no further ceremonies being required). 

They offer only the Praydjas 25 at this (Isti), but not the Anuyájas. The Prayâjas, as well as the Anuyâjas are the vital airs. The airs' which are in the head are che Prayâjas, whilst those in the lower parts of the body are the Anuyâjas. He who should offer the Anuyâjas at this (Isti) is just like a man wbo, after having cut off the vital airs residing in the lower parts of the body), wishes to put them in the head. That would be superfuity, 28 were all the vital airs, those of the head as well as those of the lower parts of the body, to be found at the same place (viz., in the head). If they therefore offer at this (Işti) only the Prayâjas without Anuyajas, then the wish which one entertains at the offering of the Anugâjas becomes also fulfilled (for the offering of the Anuyajas on this occasion would be a mistake).

FOURTH CHAPTER (The Pravargya Ceremony.") 

18. The sacrifice went away from the gods (saying), I shall not be your food. The gods said : do not go; thou alone shalt be our food. The gods then killed [42] it. When it had been taken asunder 

13 In the last pada of the first mantra there occur the words agnim atithim janânám, and also in the last pada of the second the words daivyo atithin, the heavenly guest. 

** That is to say, the ceremonies, which in the usual course of the Isti follow the eating of the sacrificial food, such as the Anuyâjas, the Súktavak, sanyuvâk, Patnisanyája and Sansthita Japa, are left out on the occasion of the Atithya-işti. 

36 They precede the principal offering, which consists of Purodusa, *This is a mistake in the sacrifice which is to be propitiated. 

The Pravargya ceremony lasts for three days, and is always performed twice a dor, in the forenoon and afternoon. It precedes the animal and Soma sacrifices. For without having undergone it, no one is allowed to take part in the solemn Soma feast prepared for the gods. It is a preparatory rite, just as the Diksa, and is intended for providing the sacrificer with a heavenly body, with which alone he is permitted to enter the residence of the gods. That the gods do not receive mortals at their residence when 

29 

(cut into pieces) by them, it was found not to be sufficient (to satisfy their appetite). The gods said : this sacrifice after having been taken asunder, will certainly not be sufficient for us. Well, let us dress (and fill up) this sacrifice. After having dressed it, they said to the Aévins, cure this sacrifice; for the Asvins are the two physicians of the gods, they are the two Adhvaryus ? [43] (sacred cooks). Thence two Adhvar yu priests provide for all the implements required for the Pravargya vessel (gharma). After having done so, they say, ** Brahma !3 we shall perform the Pravargya ceremony. Hotar ! repeat the appropriate mantras !” arriving in their very bodies, one may learn from the amusing story of the king Trišunku, as reported in the Ramayana (1, 57-60). For the performance of this important ceremony extensive preparations are to be made by the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthậtar. All the vessels and implements required are brought to the spot and placed at the left side of the Garhapatya fire. The chief implements are : an earthen Tessel of peculiar forn, called Mahavira or gharma (i.eny heat, or heated substance, for it is to be heated), a Seat (@sandi) to sit on, two wooden pieces for lifting the Mahavira pot (called sapha), two shovels for charcoal (ahrişti), one very large wooden spoon (Upaymani) from which the sacrificer drinks milk (this forms part of the ceremony), three fans (dhavitra), six shavings from the Udumbara tree as fuel, thirteen sticks, to be laid round the Mahá víra vessel (paridhi), two metal blades, one of gold add one of silver (called suvarnarajatâu hukmáu). A cow and a female sheep sro to be kept in readiness. Two bunches of kusa grass are prepared, and tied in the midst. They are called Feda, and resemble very much the Baresma (Barsom) of the Parsis, which is also tied together by means of a reed (aiwy@onhanem). 

- The Mahavira is first put on the Vedi. Then the Adhvaryu makes a circle of clay, in which afterwards the Maha vira is put. This ring is called Khara, i.e., ass, for earth is always carried on the back of donkeys to the sacrificial compound. After the priests have repeated the mantras required for propitiation (santi) namo váche, &c., the Mahavira is taken from the Vedi and placed in that earthen ring (khara). Wooden sticks are put around it along with burning coals, and also fire is put in the khara just below the Mahavira, in order to make it hot. The fire is blown by three little fans which serve as bellows. The silver blade is put below, the gold blade above the Mahavira. Whilst the empty vessel is being heated, the Hotar repeats the first series of mantras, called the purva patala. After the vessel has been made quite hot, it is lifted up by means of the two Saphas. The cow then is called, tied by the Adhvaryu with a cord, and milked. The milk is put on the left side of the Vedi, and then under recital of the mantra, a dasabhir, poured into the Mahavira. Then the milk of a goat whose kid is dead is taken, and mixed with that of the cow in the vessel. After this has been done, the contents of the Maha vira are thrown into the Ahavaniya fire. The sacrificer drinks milk from a large wooden spoon (Upayamani) which has been first sraelled by the Adhvaryu. The second series of mantras, the so-called uttara patala, is repeated when the cow is milked and her milk poured into the Mahavira. The whole ceremony has been witnessed by me. 

• Viz., the properly so-called Adhvaryu with his constant assistant Pratiprasthata. 

* The Brahma priests, ie, the president of the sacrifice, is here informed, that the priests are going to perform the Pravargya ceremony. The Hotar receives at the same time orders to repeat the appropriate mantras. The intimation to the Brahma priest as well as the order to the Hotar are given by the Adhvaryu and the Prati prusthätar, called the two Adhvaryus. 

30 

· 19. The Hotar begins with brahma jajnánam prathamam (Vai. S. 13, 5. Asval. 8. S 4, 6). In this mantra Brahma is Brihaspati (the teacher of the gods) ; by means of Brahma (i.e., the Brahmans) the Hotar thus cures the Pravargya man (the mystical personage, called "sacrifice” which had been torn to pieces by the gods). By repeating the mantra, iyam pitre râştri (Âśval. S. S. 4, 6), the Hotar puts speech in the Pravargya man; for by râştri, ż.e., queen, speech is to be under stood. 

The verse, mahân mahi astabhayad (Asval. S. S. 4, 6), is addressed to Brahmanaspati. Brahma is Brihaspati ; by means of Brahma the priest thus cures the Pravargya man. - [44] The verse addressed to Savitar is, abhi tyan devam savitaram (Vâj, S. 4, 25. Âýval. S. S. 4, 6). Savitar is the vital air ; thus the Hotar puts the vital air in this Pravargya man. 

îdasva mahân asi (1, 36, 9), they make him (the Pravargya man) sit down. 

The verse, amjanti yam prathayanto (5, 43, 7), is appropriate to the ceremony of anointing (the Pravargya vessel with melted butter). What is appropriate in the sacrifice, that is successful. 

Of the following mantras, patangam aktamasurasya (10, 177, 1), yo no sanutyu abhidasad (6, 5, 4), bhava no agne sumanâ upetar (3, 18, 1), the first as well as the second verse 5 are appropriate. 

The five verses required for killing the Rakşas, commence with, krinuşva pājaḥ prasitim (4, 4, 1-5). 

Now follow four single verses : 6 Pari två girvano gira (1, 10, 12); Adhi dvayor adadha ukthyam (1, 83,3); Sulcram te anyad yajatam (6, 58, 1); Apaśyan gopâm anipadyamanam (10, 177, 3). 

All these verses (if counted) number to twenty, one. This (sacrificial) man is twenty-one fold ; for he has ten fingers on his hands and ten 

« The Adhvaryas put the Pravargya vessel, the so-called Mahavira, in an earthen ring, called Khara. 

That is to say : of the three mantras mentioned, always that one which immediately follows them in the Samhita, is to be repeated along with them. Hor instance, of 10,177,1 (patangam aktam, &c.), is the 2nd verse, to be also repeatod. 

* Ekapatinyah. An ekapätini is such a mantra which is taken single, and not followed by any other verse which comes immediately after it in the Samhita. The term is here used to mark a distinction between : dve, i.e., two verses and pancha, i.e., tve Terses, which follow one another in the Samhita. 

31 

on his feet, and the soul is reckoned as the twenty-first. He (thus) prepares the soul as the twenty-first (part). 

20. [45] (Now follow) nine Pâvamâni-verses (dedicated to the purifica tion of the Soma juice) beginning with, srakve drapsasya dhamataḥ (9,73, 1). There are nine vital airs. By repeating these (verses), the Hotar puts the vital airs in him (the Pravargya man). (Now he repeats) ayam venas chodayat? (10, 123, 1). (When repeating this mantra, the Hotar points, when pronouncing the word ayam, i.e., this, to the navel). “This” (the navel) is meant by venaś; for some vital airs are circulat ing (venanti) above the navel, others below it. On account of this vital air (the life) taking its origin from the navel, venas (circulation, from ven to circulate) means “navel.” By repeating this mantra, the Hotar puts life in this (Pravargya man). 

(Now he repeats the (verses), pavitram te vitatam (9, 83, 1), tapash pavitram vitatam (9, 83, 2), and viyat pavitram dhişana atanvata. On account of their containing the word "pavitram” (pure), the vital airs are purified (when these mantras are recited over them). These are the vital airs of the lower part of the body presiding over the semen, urine, and excrements. (By repeating these three verses) he puts these vital airs in this (Pravargya man). 

21. 

· (He now repeats) a hymn, addressed to Brahmanaspati. ' Gananam två ganapatim havâmahe (2, 23) Brahma is Brihaspati; by means of Brahma he thus cures him (the sacrificial man, who had been torn to pieces). The verses beginning with prathaścha [46] yasya saprathascha nama (10, 181, 1-3) are the three Gharmatanu mantras ; by repeating them the Hotar provides the Pravargya man with a body, and a form. (For in the fourthi pada of the first of these verses), there is said: "Vasis tha brought the Rathantara Sâma," and (in the last half verse of the second Gharma-tanu mantra is said), " Bharadvaja made the Brihat Sâma out of Agni.” 10 By repeating these mantras, the Hotar provides the Pravargya man with the Ratbantara and Bribat-Sâmans (required for its prosperity). 

According to Sayana this verse is taken from another Sálha. * In the prd pada of the first verse, the name "brahmanaspati" is mentioned. 

* This means, those mantras the recital of which is calculated to give the new body, which is to be made in the Pravargya vessel (the Gharma), the proper shape. 

10 The Risi of the Rathantara Saroa : abhi två süra nonunah (7, 32, 22 ) is Vasistha, and that of the Brihat Sâma: tuâm iddhi havämahe (6, 46, 1.) is Bharadvája.32 

(By repeating) three verses (of the hymn) apaśyan två manasa chekitânan (10, 183, 1), the Kişi of which is Prajâvân, the son of Prajapati (the Lord of creatures), be provides him with offspring. 11 

Now the Hotar repeats) nine verses in different metres, commencing with ka râdhad dhotrâ (1, 120, 1-9). 

(These different metres represent the difference in magnitude and expansion of the extremities of the belly of the sacrificial man). For the extremities of the mystical) sacrificial body (to be restored by means of the Pravargya ceremony) vary as to magnitudo and largeness; some are rather thin, others are rather big. 

Thence are verses of various metres required (for the verses repre sent the extremities of the body). By means of these verses (the Rişi) Balşivan [47] went to the beloved residence of the Asvins. He conquered the highest heaven. He who has this knowledge goes up to the beloved house of the Asvins, and conquers the highest heaven. 

(Now he repeats) the hymn: Abhdty agnir uşasâm (5, 76.) The words : papivainsam ašvinâ gharmam achha (the fourth pada of the first verse of the hymn mentioned) are appropriate 12 to the ceremony. What is appropriate at the sacrifice, that is successful. This hymn is in the Tristubh metre, for Triştubh is strength; by this means he puts strength in this (Pravargya man.) 

He repeats the hymn: grâvaneva tad id artham jarethe (2, 39). In this hymn there being expressions like, akść iva" as the eyes” (2, 39,5), karnaviva "as two ears," nasa iva " as a nose” (2, 39,6), he puts in this way, by enumerating the limbs of the body, the senses in this (Pra vargya man.) This hymn is in the Triştubh metre; for Triştubb is strength. In this way he puts strength in this (Pravargya man.) . He repeats the hymns: ile dyâvâprithivi (1, 112). (The words in the second pada :) gharmam surucham are appropriate. This hymn is in the Jagati metre; cattle is of the same (Jagati) nature. Thus he pro vides this (Pravargya man) with cattle. By the words : “wbat assistance you (Afvina) have rendered such and such a one" (which occur in every Verse of the hymn mentioned), he provides this (Pravargya man) with all those wishes (and their fulfilment) which the Asvins in this hymn are said to have deemed proper to fulfil. 

[48] In repeating this hymn, the priest thus makes this (Pravargya man) thrive by means of those desires (including their satisfaction). 

11 The Hotar when repeating the first of these verses, looks at the sacrificer, when repeating the second, at the sacrificer's wife, when the third, at himself. 

12 The word “ gharma," which is a name of the Pravargya passel, is mentioned in it. 18 For the word " gharma" (the Pravargya vessel) is mentioned in it. 

33 

He repeats the ruchitavate, i.e., the verse whose characteristic the word "ruch," to shine, is: aruruchad uşasah priśnir (9, 83, 3). In this way he provides this (Pravargya man) with splendour. 

With the verse, dyubhir aktubhik paripátam (1, 112, 25), he con cludes (the ceremony). (In repeating this verso, the words of which) Cristebhir prithivi uta dyâuh (contain a prayer for prosperity) he makes thus this Pravargya man thrive, granting him all that is wished for (in the verse mentioned). Now is (completed) the first part of the mantra collection (required at the Pravargya ceremony). 

22. The second part of the mantra collection 14 (required at the Pravargya ceremony) is as follows:-- 

1, Upahvaye sudughâm dhenum (1, 164, 26). 2, Himkrinvati vasupatní (1, 164, 27). 3, Abhi tvâ deva Savitah (1, 24, 3). 4, Samt vatsann amatribhiḥ (9, 104, 2). 5, Samvatsa iva måtribhik (9, 105, 2). 6, Yaste stanah saíayo (1, 164, 49). 7, Gaur amimed anuvatsam (I, 164, 28). 8, Namased upasîdatam (9, 11, 6). 9, Samjânând upastdan (1, 72, 5). 10, Adaśabhir (8, 61, 8). 11, Duhanti saptâikân (8, 61, 7). 

12, Samiddho Agnir Ašvind (Asval. 4, 7). [49] 13, Samiddho Agnir vrişanâ (Âšval. 4, 7). 

14, Tadu prayakşatamam (1, 62, 6). 15, Atmanvan nabho duhyate (9, 74, 4). 16, Uttiştha Brahmanaspate (1, 40, 1). 17, Adhukșat pipyuşê nn ışam (8, 61, 16). 18, Upadrava payasa (Âśval. 4, 7). 19, Asute simchata śriyam 8, 61, 13). 20, Andnam aśvinor (8, 9, 7). 21, Samutye mahatêr apah (8,7, 22). 

These twenty-one verses are appropriate. What is appropriate at a sacrifice, that is successful. 

14 During the recital of the first part of the Pravargya mantras, the vessel had been made only hot; now milk, butter, &c., are to be poured into it. A cow is brought to the spot, which is to be milked by the Adhvarya. To this ceremony the first mantra of the second part, “I call the cow yielding good milk," refers. 

34 

The Hotar, when standing behind the others), repeats ud u sya televaḥ Savitâ hiranyaya (6, 71, 1). When going forward, he repeats, praitu Brahmanaspati (1, 40, 3.) When looking at the Khara (the earthen ring, in which the Pravargya vessel is placed), he repeats : Gandharva ittha (9, 83, 4). When repeating nâke suparnam upa yat (9, 85, 11), he takes his seat. By the two mantras, tapto vam gharmo naksati svahotâ (Atharv. 7, 73,5. Ašv. 4, 7), and ubha pibatam (1, 46, 15), the Hotar sacrifices to the forenoon (the deity of the forenoon). After the formula: Agni eat! he pronounces Vauşat! which is in lieu of the Sviştakrit. 

By the mantras, yad usriyâsu svâhutam (Atharv. 7, 73, 4. Âbv. 4, 7.), and asya pibatam Ašvina (8, 5, 14), he sacrifices for the afternoon. After the formula, Agni eat! he pronounces Vauşat! which is in lieu of the Sviştakrit. They take, for making Sviştakrit, parts of three offerings, viz., Soma juice (contained in the stalks), the things thrown into the Pra vargya vessel (milk, butter, etc.), and hot wheys. When the Hotar (after having repeated the two mantras, above mentioned, along with the formula, [50] Agni eat!) pronounces the formula Vauşat ! then thus the omission of "Agni Sviştakrit" is replaced." 

The Brahma priest mutters (makes japa), aśâ dakşindsad (Aév. 4, 7.) 

(After the offering has been given to the fire) the Hotar repeats the following (seven) verses : svähäkritaḥ śuchir deveşu (Atharv. 7, 73, 3. Âøv 4, 7.); samudrad úrmin udiyarti veno (10, 123, 2,; drapsah samudram abhi (10, 123, 8); sakhe sakhayam (4, 1, 3); úrdhva û şu na (1, 36, 13); ardhvo nah pahi (1, 36, 14); tam ghen ittha (8, 58, 17). These verses are appropriate. What is appropriate at the sacrifice, that is successful.. 

By the mantra, pâvaka soche tava (3, 2, 6), the Hotar wants to eat. When eating it, he says: “Let us eat the (remainder of the) offering which has been offered, of the sweet offering which has been thrown into the most brightly blazing (indratama) fire! (Let us eat) of thee, O divine gbarma (the contents of the Pravargya vessel) which art full of honey, full of sap, full of food, and quite hot (angirasvat"). Praise to thee (0 gharma !) ; do me no harm !" 

When the Pravargya vessel is put down, then the Hotar repeats these two mantras, syeno na yonim sadanam (9, 71,6), and ayasmin sapta Vasavala 

15 Be stands behind the other priests, when the Pravargya vessel is taken away. ** Anantar-iti means " what has not gone into"=wbat is omitted. 

17 The word certainly has here no reference to the Angiras, the celebrated Rişis. One of the characteristics of the Gharma food is that it is very hot. This is expressed here. Angıras had no doubt originally the same meaning as aigara, 

35 

(Afval. 4, 7). In whatever (part of the) day (forenoon or afternoon), they are about to take off (the Pravargya vessel from its place), he repeats the mantra, havir havişmo mahi (9, 83, 5). With the verse, suyavasad bhaga vati (1, 164, 40), he concludes (the ceremony). 

[51] The Gharma (ceremony) represents the cohabitation of the gods. The Gharma vessel is the penis; the two handles (placed underneath, to lift it) are the two testicles, the Upayamanal* the thighs. The milk (in the vessel) is the seed. This seed (in the shape of milk) is poured into Agni as the womb of the gods for production. For Agni is the womb af the gods. 

He who knowing this, sacrifices according to this rite (yajñakratu), is born (anew) from the womb of Agni and the offerings, and participates in the nature of the Rik, Yajus, and Saman, the Veda" (sacred knowledge), the Brahma (sacred element), and immortality, and is absorbed in the deity. 

28. 

(Upasad.) The Devas and Asuras were fighting in these worlds. The Asuras made these worlds fortified castles, just as the strongest and most powerful (kings) do. Thus they made the earth an iron castle, the air a silver, the sky a golden castle, Thus they made these worlds castles. The Devas said, these Asuras have made these worlds castles ; let us thus make other worlds in opposition to these castles. They made out of the earth in opposition (to the iron castle of the Asuras) a sitting-room* (sadas), out [52] of the air a fire-place (âgnidhriya), and out of the sky two repositories for food (havirdhana). Such they made these worlds in opposition to the castles into which the three worlds had been transformed by the Asuras). The gods said, Let us perform the burnt offerings called Upasado fi.eu besieging). For, by means of an upasad, i.e., besieging, they conquer a large (fortified) town. Thus they did. When they performed the first Upasad, they drove by it them (the Asuras) out from this world (the earth). 

18 A large wooden spoon, from which the sacrificer drinks milk, 

19 Bâ yana here understands by Veda the Atharvaveda, or all the Vedas colleetively. Brahma is according to him Hiranyagarbha (the universal soul), and amrita the supreme soul. But it is very doubtful whether these interpretations are right. By * Veda" certainly the Atharva Veda cannot be meant; for it was not recognized as a sacred book at the time of tbe composition of the Brâhmanas. 

30 A place near the so-called Uttara pedi which is outside that one appropriated for the performance of the Istis. The latter place is called Prachina varría. This sadas is the sitting-room for the king Soma, after his removal from the Práchina varsa, - 

11 There is observable throughout this chapter a pun between the two meanings of upasad "siege," and, a certain ceremony. 

30 

By the performance of the second, they drove them out of the air, and by the performance of the third, out of the sky. Thus they were driven out of these worlds. The Asuras driven out of these (three) worlds, repaired to the Ritus (seasons). The gods said, Let us perform the Upasads. 

Thus they did. 

These Upasads being three, they performed each twice ; (thus) they became six. There are six Ritus (seasons); thus they drove them (the Asuras) out of the Ritus. The Asuras driven out of the Ritus, repaired to the months. The Devas said, Let us perform the Upasads. Thus they did. The Upasads being six, Let us perform each twice, that makes twelve. There are twelve months. They drove them out of the months. The Asuras driven out of the months repaired to the half-months. The Devas said, Let us perform the Upasads. Thus they did. The Upasads being twelve, they performed each twice : that makes twenty-four. There are twenty-four balf-months. They turned them (the Asuras) out of the half-months. Tho Asuras, turned out of [53] the half-months, repaired to Day and Night (ahordtra). The Devas said, Let us perform the Upasads. Thus they did. By means of the Upasad which they per formed for the first part of the day, they turned them out of day, and by means of that which they performed for the second part of the day, they turned them out of pight. Thus they disappeared from both day and night. Thence the first Upasad is to be performed during the first part of the day, and the second, during the second part. By doing so, the sacrificer leaves only so much space to his enemy (as there is between the junction of day and night.) 

24. The Upasads are the goddesses of victory (jitayaḥ). For, by means of them, the gods gained a complete victory, destroying all their enemies. He who has such a knowledge, gains a victory, destroying all his enemies. All the victories which the gods gained in these (three) worlds, or in the Ritus (seasons), or in the months, or the half-months, or in day and night, will he (also) gain who has such a knowledge. 

(The Tanúnaptram " ceremony, or solemn oath taken by the priests.) 

The Devas were afraid, surmising the Asuras might become aware of their being disunited, and seize [54] their reign. They marched out in 

25 The Tânûnaptram ceremony which is alluded to and commented on in this para graph, is to take place immediately after the Atithya isti is finished, and not, as it might appear from this passage, after the Upasad. It is a solemn oath taken by the sacrificer and all the officiating priests pledging themselves mutually not to injure one another. It is chietly considered as a safeguard for the sacrificer who is, as it were, entirely given up to the hands of the priests. They are believed to have the power of 

37 

several divisions and deliberated. Agni marched out with the Vasus, and deliberated. Indra did so with the Rudras; Varuņa with the Adityas; and Brihaspati with the Visve Devas. Thus all, having severally marched out, deliberated. They said, “Well, let us put these our dearest bodies 23 in the house of Varuņa, the king, (i.e., water); hé among us who should, out of greediness, transgress this (oath, not to do anything which might injure the sacrificer), he shall no more be joined with them." 24 

[55] They put their bodies in the house of Varuna. This putting of their bodies in the house of Varuņa, the king, became their Tanúnaptram (joining of bodies). Thence they say: none of those joined together by the tânúnaptram ceremony is to be injured. Thence the Asuras could not conquer their (the gods) empire (for they all had been made inviolable by this ceremony). 

25. 

The Atithya-isti is the very head of the sacrifice (the sacrificial 

destroying him, or cheating him out of what he is sacrificing for, by not performing the ceremonies required in the proper, but in a wrong, way. This oath is taken in the following way: The Adhvaryu takes one of the large sacrificial spoons, called Dhruvá, and puts melted butter in ita He then takes a vessel (Kamsd, a goblet) into which, after having placed it on the Vedi, he puts by means of a Sruva the melted butter contained in the Dhruvå. He puts five times the Sruva in the Dhruvâ, and each time after a piece of melted butter having been taken out, a Yajus (sacrificial formula) is repeated, viz: āpataye två grinnámi; paripataye två grihnâmi; táninaptre två grih námi ; śákvardy två grihnámi; sakmann o, işthaya två grihnáni (see Black Yajurveda 1, 2, 10, 2.; Vájasaneya Sanh. 5,5, where grih námi and två are only put once). All priests with the sacrificer now touch the vessel (Kamsa) in which the ajya or melted butter thus taken out of the Dhruvå had been put. They may touch, however, the ajya (melted butter) by means of a stalk of Kusa grass. When touching the butter, they all repeat the formula : anádhriştam asi, &c. (BI. Y. 1, 2, 10, 2.) “thou art inviolable." All the seven Hotars then put their hands in the madanti, a copper vessel, which is filled with water. This latter ceremony, only performed by the Hotars, is regarded as the symbolical deposition of the priests' own bodies in the “house of Varuna, "' which is only a poetical expression for the copper vessel filled with water, 

As to the name tänúnaptrum, one is induced to refer it to tanúnapát, a name of Agni, by which he is invoked in the Prayâjas and which occurs along with others at this very ceremony. But I doubt whether the name tânúnaptram has here anything to do with Agni tanúnapât. The latter word means only one's own son, or one's own relative. By taking this solemn oath, the sacrificer and the officiating priests come as it werenotis the closest contact with one another, bound by ties as strong as family ties. The term, therefore, means only: contracting of the closest relationship, brotherhood. 

28 say. understands by this expression " wife and children." But this inter pretation is doubtful to me. 

24 This is the formula of the oath, which is very ancient in language, as the forms: Sañgacchatâi, 3rd pers. sing., conjunct,, middle voice, and, bhavishad, conjuuct. of the aorist, clearly prove. 

38 

personage); the Upasads are his neck. The two stalks of Kusa grass (held by the Hotar) are of the same length; for head and neck are equal. 

The gods made the Upasads as an arrow (the upasad ceremony served them as an arrow); Agni was its shaft, Soma its steel, Vişnu its point, and Varuņa its feathers. The gods holding this arrow represented by the Ajya (at the Upasad ceremony) discharged it, and, breaking with it the castles of the Asuras, entered them. For these (deities, Agni and 80 on) are in the Ajya offering. At first he (the sacrificer) undergoes the religious ceremony of drinking (milk) coming from four nipples (of the cow), 25 for the arrow in the Upasads consists of four parts, viz., shaft, steel, point, and feathers. He (subsequently) undergoes the religious ceremony of drinking what comes from three nipples. For the arrow in the Upasads consists of three parts, viz., shaft, steel, and point. He under goes the religious ceremony of drinking what comes from two nipples. For the arrow in the Upasads consists of two parts, viz., shaft and point. He undergoes the religious ceremony of drinking what comes from one nipple (alone). For, in the Upasads, there is only “one” arrow mentioned (as (56) a unit). By means of one alone (i.e., by co-operation of all its parts) effect is produced. The worlds which are above are ex tended26 and those which are below, contracted. The priest (in per forming this ceremony) commences by that number of nipples (four) which represents the larger worlds, and proceeds to those which represent the smaller ones.27 (That is done) for conquering these worlds. 

(Now the Samidhêni verses for the forenoon and afternoon Upasad ceremonies are mentioned).28 

Upasadyâya mishushe (7, 15, 1-3), Imâm me Agne samidham (2,6, 1-3). Three Sâmidhêni verses are to be repeated each time (the first set in the forenoon and the second in the afternoon). They are complete in form. When the form is complete, and the verse which is recited alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, then the sacrifice is successful. For Anuvakyds and Yâjyâs, Jaghnivati verses (such verses, as con tain derivatives of the root han to kill) ought to be used. These are : agnir vritrâni jamghanat (6, 16, 34); ya agra iva saryahd (6, 16, 39); 

* See Black Yajurveda, ed. Cowell, 1, p. 400. 

** The highest world is Satyaloka which is the largest of all; Dyulota is smaller; Antariksa loka and Bhurloka are successively sinaller still. 

31 That is to say, he milks on the first day four nipples, on the second three, and on the third two and one. 

38 After some preliminary remarks on the importance and signification of the Upasad ceremony, the author goes on to set forth the duties of the Hotar when performing tho Upasad, which has all the characteristics of a common Isti. 

39 

tvam somâsi satpatih (1, 91, 5); gayasphano amivaha (1, 91, 12.); idam Vişnur vichakrame (1, 22, 17.); trini pada vichakrame (1, 22, 8). 29 

This is the order for the forenoon ceremony). For the afternoon cere mony he inverts the order of these verses (so as to make the Yâįpå of [57] the forenoon Anuvâkyâ in the afternoon, and vice versa). By means of these Upasads the Devas defeated (the Asuras), and, breaking down their castles, entered them. 

In performing the Upasad ceremony he should use verses in the same metre (for all the Ahutis), not such ones as are in different metres. When the Hotar uses different metres, then he produces the king's evil on the necks (of the sacrificers). Thus the Hotar has it in his power to produce diseases. Thence the mantras (for the chief deities at the Upasad iştı) should be always of the same metre, not of different metres. 

Upåviņ, the son of Janaśrutå, said in a Brāhmaṇam about the Upasads, as follows: “From this reason on account of the Upasads) the face of an ugly-looking Srotriya makes upon the eye of an observer the distinct im pression, as if it were very full, and he like a person who is in the habit of singing." He said so, for the Upasad offerings, consisting of melted butter, appear on the throat as a face put over it.) 

26. (Neither Prayájas nor Anuyå jas are to be used at the Upasad Isti). 

The Prayâjas as well as the Anuyâjas are the armour of the gods. (The Upasad işti) is to be performed without both, in order to sharpen the arrow for preventing it from recoiling. 

The Hotar repeats the mantras (at this occasion) only after having overstepped (the boundary between the Vedi and Ahavaniya fire on all sidesto), in order to supervene the sacrifice, and prevent it from going. 

[58] They (the divines) say: it is, as it were, a cruel act, when they perform ceremony of (touching) the melted butter (the Tântnapatram) near the king Soma.3 The reason is, that Indra, using melted butter as his thunderbolt, killed Vritra. In order to compensate the king Soma for any injury he might have received from the performance of the Tânûnaptram ceremony in his presence) they sprinkle the king (Soma) 

1The respective deities of these Anuvákyâs and Yajyas are: Agni, soma, and Vişnu. 

*In most ceremonies he oversteps this boundary only towards the south. But at the Upasad ceremony it is done on all sides. 

The vessel, containing the Ajya which is to be toached by all the priests and the sacrificer, in order to bind them together by a solemn oath, is placed over the Soma plant which is lying on the Vedi. To put anything on the king Soma, is regarded as a cruel treatment which is to be atoned for. Soma is to be pacified by sprinkling with water, which ceremony is called apyayanam... Soma prayoga. 

40 

with water (whilst the following mantra is repeated): amśur ambuşte deva Soma (Taitt, 1, 2, 11, 2). When they perform this ceremony near him (Soma), which is, as it were, a cruel treatment of him, then they (sub sequently) make him (Soma) by this (sprinkling of water) fat (when lying) on her (the Vedi), and make him grow. 

The king Soma is the fruit of heaven and earth. When repeating the words : esta rayah, » &c., they (the Hotri priests) throw the two bun dles of kusa grass (held in their hands, in the southern corner of the Vedi), and put their right hands ever their left ones (to cover the kusa grass). By making a bow to" heaven and earth" (which are represented by those two bundles of kusa grass) they make them both grow.

FIFTH CHAPTER. (The Ceremonies of carrying the Fire, Soma, and the Offerings from their Places in the Prachina-vansa to the Uttara Vedi.) 

27. The king Soma lived among the Gandharvas. The Gods and Kişis deliberated; as to how the king might be induced to return to them. Vâch (the goddess of speech) said, the Gandharvas lust after women. I (there fore) shall transform myself into a woman, and then you sell me to them (in exchange for Soma).' The gods answered: “No! how may we live without thee? She said, sell me unto them; if you should want me, I shall return to you." Thus they did. In the disguise of a big naked wo man she was sold (by the gods to the Gandharvas) in exchange for Soma. In imitation (of this precedent) they drive away an immaculate cow of one year's age, being the price at which they purchase the king Soma. She (this cow) may, however, be rebought ; for Vâch (whom this cow, for which the Soma is bought, represents) returned to the gods. Thence the mantras (after Soma has been bought) are to be repeated with a low voice. After Soma has been bought, Vâch is with the Gandharvas; but she retuns as soon as the ceremony of the Agnipranayana is performed. 

*These words follow the mantra mentioned above : ansur amśuste, &c. (Taitt. Samh. 1, 2, 11, 1.; but the text differs a little from that in our Brahmanam). 

3. The term used is: prastarenihnavate, literally, he conceals the two bundles of kusa grass. The concealment is done in the manner expressed in the translation, as I my self have witnessed it. 

* This is the meaning of the verb pan, which appears to be related to the Latin pignus, pawn. 

2 Instead of giving a cow, the sacrificer pays the price of a cow in money to tho Brahman who brings him the Soma. To sell Soma is regarded as very disreputablo. The seller is not admitted to the sacrificial compound, nor invited to the great dinner which the sacrificer must give to Brahmans at the end of the sacrifice. 

3 As a rule, the cows given in Daksiya, cannot be rebought by the giver: 

28. [60] The Agni-pranayana, i.e., Ceremony of Carrying the Sacrificial 

Fire to the Altar destined for the Animal and Soma Sacrifices.) 

The Adhvaryu orders (the Hotar ), when the sacrificial fire is to be carried (to the Uttarâ Vedi), to repeat mantras appropriate (to the ceremony). 

(He repeats :) pra devam devya (10, 176, 2). If the sacrificer be a Brahman, he ought to repeat a verse in the Gayatri metre ; for the Brah man belongs to the Gayatri metre (has its nature). The Gayatri is beauty and acquisition of sacred knowledge. (This metre) makes him the (sacrifi cer) thus prosper by means of the beauty and sacred knowledge (which is contained in it). 

If the sacrificer be a Kşattriya, he should repeat a Tristabh, viz. imam make vidathyaya (3, 54, 1). For the Kşattriya belongs to the Triştubh (has its nature). Tristubh is strength, sharpness of senses and power. By repeating thus a Triştubh, the FIotar makes him (the sacrificer of the Kşattriya caste) prosper through the strength, sharpness of sense and power (contained in the Triştubh). By the words of the second pada of the verse mentioned): sasvatkritva idydya prajabhrur, i.e., "they brought to him who is to be praised always (Agni), the Hotar brings the sacrificer at the head of his (the sacrificer's) family. By the second half verse, śrinotu no damyebhir, de, i.e., may Agni hear us with the hosts (the flames) posted in his house; may he, the imperishable, hear (us) with his hosts in heaven! (the Hotar effects that). Agni shines in the house of the sacrificer till the end of his life (i.e., he is always protected by him). 

If the sacrificer be a Vaisya, the Hotar should repeat a verse in the Jagatî metre, viz: -ayam iha prathamo [61] (4, 7, 1). For the Vaišya belongs to the Jagatî: cattle is of the same (Jagati) nature. Thus he makes him prosper by means of cattle (provides him with it). In its fourth pada vaneşu, &c., the word više (Vaisya) is mentioned. This is appropriate. What is appropriate, that is successful in the sacrifice. 

When repeating the verse : ayam u șya pra devayum (10, 176, 3), which is in the Anuştubh metre, the. Hotar sends forth speech (ie, he repeats for the first time, this mantra, with a loud voice again, after having only inaudibly muttered some of the preceding ones). For the Anuştubh metre is speech. By repeating an Anuştubh), he thus sends forth speech in speech. By the words ayam u sya he expresses the following sentence: I who formerly was living among the Gandharvas have come.4 

• The author of the Brahmanam tries to find in the words ayu in zi sya of the mantra.42 

By the verse : ayam agnir uruśyati, &c. (10, 176, 4) i.e., "this Agni makes (us) fearless by dint of his immortal nature, as it were," the Hotar provides him (the sacrificer) with immortality. (The second half of this verse), sahasas chit sahîyan devo jivåtave kritah, i.e., "the god has been made very powerful by means of (his own) power, in order to preserve [62] (our) lives" signifies, that he (Agni) is the god who, by (our) repeating this verse, is made the preserver of (our) lives. 

(The Hotar now repeats :) ițâyás tvá pade vayam, &c. (3, 29, 4), i.e., "we put thee, O Jâtavedas! (Agni) in the place of Ilå, in the centre (ndbhi of the Uttará Vedr) 5 on the earth to carry up (our) offerings." By nábhi (lit. navel), the nábhi of the Uttard Vedi is meant. Nidhimahi (lit. we put down) means "they are about to put him (Agni) down." The term " havyaya voļhave" means : he is about to carry up the sacrifice. 

(The Hotar repeats :) Agne viśvebhiḥ svanila (6, 15, 16). “O Agni, " with thy well-armed host (the flames), take first with all the gods thy "seat in the hole which is stuffed with wool; carry well the sacrificial "offering, seasoned with melted butter, and deposited in thee as in a nest, "for the sacrificer who is producing (the mystical sacrificial man) anew." (When repeating the first and second padas :) agne višvebhih, he makes him (Agni) with all the gods sit. (When repeating the third pada : kulayinam ghritavantam, &c.) a bird's nest, as it were, consisting of sticks of fir-tree wood, an odoriferous gum (guggul), a braid of hair (ürnâstukah), and a kind of fragrant grass, is prepared (for Agni) at the sacrifice. 

in question, an allusion to the fable reported in 1, 27, on the Vach's (speech) residence among the Gandharyas. But this interpretation is wholly ungrammatical and childish. Ayam, the masculine of the demonstrative pronoun, is here, as Saya na explains, according to the Brahmaṇam, taken as a feminino, in order to make it refer to Vách, which word is feminine. The impossibility of such an explanation will be apparent to every reader. The verse in question refers to the ceremony of the Agni-pranayanam, the carrying of the fire from the Abavaniya fre to the Uttara Vedi; but its subject is Agni, and not vách. I trapslate it as follows: "This very Hotar (i.e., Agni, whom the Hotar ropresonts) " desirous of worshipping the gods, is carried (thither, to the Uttará Vedl) for the per "formance of the sacrifice (animal and Soma offering). He (when being carried) appears " by himself as a fery chariot (the sun) surrounded (by a large retinue of priests and “sacrificers)." 

The Nabhi of the Uttará Vedi (the altar outside the Prachina vainía or place for the Iştis with the three fires) is a hole of 2 quadrangular form in the midst of this allar, filled with kusa grass, &c. (see below) in which the fire brought from the Abavanîya is deposited, 

* The articles here mentioned, are put in the Nabhi, or hole in the Uttará Vedi. They are regarded as forming the best of Agni, As living in this nest like a bird, he is called kuliyi, 

(When repeating the fourth pada :) yajnam naya, &c., he thus places the sacrifice (the sacrificial personage) straight on him (Agni). 

[63] (The Hotar repeats): sida hotah sva u loke, &c. (3, 29, 8), ie, "sit, Hotar! (Agni) in thy own place (the Nábhi), being conspi “cuous; make sit the sacrifice in the hole of the well-nade (nest). "Mayst thou, Agni, who art going to the gods with the offering, "repeat sacrificial verses addressed to the gods?. Mayst thou grant the “sacrificer a life with abundance." 

By " Hotar” Agni is to be understood; for he is the Hotar of the gods. “His own place” (sva u loke) is the Nâbli of the Uttara Vedi. By the words : make sit, &c., the Hotar asks a blessing for the sacrificer; for the "yajña" (sacrifice, mentioned in this verse) is the sacrificer. When repeating the second half of this verse : devâvír, &c., the Hotar provides the sacrificer with life ; for “vayas" (mentioned in this verse) is life. 

(The Hotar repeats :) ni hota hotrişadane (2, 9, 1), i.e., “the Hotar of "great knowledge and skill, who is brightly shining, sat down on the " Hotri-seat (place for the Hotar), Agni, who deeply comprehends the "inviolable laws (of the sacrificial art), he, the most splendid (vasişthah) "who bears a thousand burdens (z.es, preserver of all) and has a flaming tongue." By Hotar is Agni to be understood ; hotrişadanam is the nábhi of the uttarâ vedi. By "he sat dowa" is expressed that he was put there. The term "vasiştha" means, that Agni is the most shining (vasu) among the gods. The term "sahasrambhar(" means, that they, though he (Agni) be only one, multiply him by using him at different occasions. He who has this knowledge, has a thousand-fold profit. 

The Hotar concludes with the verse : tvam dứtas tvan u naḥ (2,9, 2), i, e., “thou art our messen. Fr, our [64] protector behind (us); "thou the bringer of wealth, O strong one! O Agni ! do not neglect the “bodies (members) in the spread of our families. The herdsman " with his light was awake." Agni is the herdsman (gopa) of the gods. He who knowing this, concludes (the ceremony of Agni-pra ņayanam) with this verse (mentioned), has Agni everywhere round him as herdsman (watchman) for himself and the sacrificer, and secures thus welfare for the whole year. 

He recites these eight verses (just enumerated), which are complete in form. What is complete in form, that is, when the mantra recited alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, that is successful in 

* The verb yaj has here (as in many other cases) the meaning: to repeat the YAjy& mantra. 

44 

the sacrifice. Of these eight verses he repeats the first and last thrice; that makes twelve. Twelve months make a year ; the year is Prajapati. He who has such a knowledge, prospers through these verses which reside in Prajâ pati. 

. By repeating the first and last verses thrice, he ties the two ends of the sacrifice, in order to give it a hold and tighten it to prevent it from falling down. 

29. (The Carrying of the Repositories 8 of Sacred Food to the Uttara Vedi). 

The Adhvaryu calls (upon the Hotar): repeat the mantras appropriate to the two repositories with sacred food (havirdhâna) being carried (to the Uttarâ Vedi). 

He repeats: Jujeo mâm brahma, ốc. (10, 13, 1), “the Brahma is joined to the praises of you both.” [85] For the two Havirdhânas, which are gods, were united with the Brahma. By reciting this verse he joins both these (Havirdbânas) with the Brahma, and having this latter (Brahma) power, he does not suffer any harm. 

He repeats the triplet: pretâm yajnasya sambhuva (2, 41, 19-21), which is addressed to Heaven and Earth. 

They ask : “Why does the Hotar repeat a triplet addressed to Heaven and Earth, when he is reciting mantras to the two Havirdhanas being removed (to the Uttarâ Vedi) ?” The answer is): Because Heaven and Earth are the two Havirdhanas of the gods. They are always repositories for offerings ; for every offering is between them (Heaven and Earth). 

The verse, yame iva yatamane yadaitam (10, 13, 2), means : these two Havirdhanas, walk together, like twins, their arms stretched. (The second pada of this verse) pra ram bharan mánuşa devayantah means, that men bring both (these Havirdhanas) when worshipping god. (The third and fourth padas :) âsidatam u lokam, &c., allude to Soma (by the name Indu). By repeating this (half verse), the priest prepares for the king Soma (a seat) to sit on (alluding to åsidatam). 

(He repeats :) adhi dvayor adadhâ ukthyam vachaḥ (1, 83, 3). This ukthyam vachah is as a cover, forming the third piece (in addition to the two Havirdhânas) put over both. 10 For ukthyam vachan is the 

* The two Havirdhånas, are two carts, on which the Soma and the other offerings are put, and covered with a cover (chhadih), for carrying all things from the Prâchîna-vamsa to the Uttari Vedi. The cover consists of grass. See Black Yajurveda, ed. Cowoll i. p. 428, 

'It is to be taken as third person of the Atmanepadam, not as a first one. 

10 This is symbolically to be understood. The author calls the expression ukthyam vachaḥ a cover, to which opinion he, probably, was led by the frequency of the term :

sacrificial performance. By means of this (ukthyam vachah) he thus makes the sacrifice successful. 

[66] The term yata, i.e., cruel, used in the second pada (yatasruchâ, 1, 83, 3), is propitiated in the following third pada by asamyata, i.e., appeased, propitiated.11 By the fourth pada, bhadra saktir, &c., he asks for a blessing. 

He repeats the Visvarûpa verse 12 : visvá růpâni pratimuñchate (5, 81, 2). He ought to repeat this verse when looking at the upper part (raráta) 13 of the posts (between which the two Havirdhậnas are put); for, on this part there every form is hung, white and black, as it were. He who having such a knowledge repeats this verse when [67] looking at the upper part of the posts, obtains for himself and the sacrificer every form. 

With the verse, pari två girvano gira (1, 10, 12), he concludes. He should repeat this concluding verse at the time he night think both the Havirdhậnas closed by hanging over them the bunch of Darbhat: (between the two posts). He who knowing thus concludes with this verse, when the two Havirdhậnas are thus closed, secures for himself 

uktham vấchi, i, e.,“ the śastra has been repeated" at the end of the recitations of the Hotri-priests at the Soma libations to denote that they are finished. The Hotar must stop after having recited the first half of the verse, adhi dvayor, as is said in the Åsval. srauta satras, 4, 9, and indicated in the Saptahautra prayoga. The rule in Ašval., which is strictly observed by the Sirotrigas up to this day, rans as follows. 

अधि द्वयोरदधा उकथ्यं वच इति अधर्च श्रारमेद व्यवस्ता चेष्ट्रराटी विश्वारूपाणि प्रतिमुंचते व्यवस्तायां i.e., Ho should stop after having repeated half of the verso adhi dvayor, when the bunch of kusa grass is not yet hang over the two posts. When this bunch is hung over, he recites (the second half of that verse, and ) visva rüpâni. The form vyavasta is contraction of vyava-sita (from the root si, to tie, bind). 

11 The interpretation which the writer of the Brâhmaņa gives of this passage, is egregiously wrong. Yata-sruk can only mean with the sacrificial spoon kept in his hand; " asaiyata (instead of asamyatasruk) then stands in opposition to it, meaning: having laid it aside. The meaning " cruel" is given to yata by Sayana. 

1% So called from the beginning words: visvá růpáni, It refers to the objects of senses becoming manifest again by sunrise. For Savitar the san, brings forth "all forms." 

1x This translation is made according to oral information obtained from a Brahman who officiated as a Hotar, Sâyana explains it as "a garland of Darbha." It is true, bunch of Darbha grass, consisting of dry and green stalks, the first representing the white, the latter the dark, colour, is hung up at the upper part of the two posts (called methi) between which the two Havirdhanas are pat. Therefore, when the priest looks at the upper part of this gate, he necessarily glances at the bunch of Darbha grass which must be hung there. The garland which is hang up, is designated by the name : rarátam, as appears from the Yajus, which is repeated by the Adhyarya at that time : vişnor rårálam asi, See Taittirîya Saph, 1, 2, 13, 3, and Sâyana's Commentary on it, vol. i. p. 429, ed. Cowell. 

14 The term in the original is parisrita, which literally means surrounded. 

46 and the sacrificer fine wonien who are not naked (covered with clothes, jewels, &c.}. 

Both are closed with a Yajusmantra.18 Thus the Adhvaryus do it with the said Yajus. When the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthậtar on both sides (of the Havirdhanas) drive in the two stakes (methi), then he should conclude. For at that time the two Havirdhanas are closed. 

These eight verses which he has repeated are complete in form. What is complete in form, that is, when the verse recited alludes to the ceremony which ¿s being performed, that is successful in the sacrifice. Of these, he repeats ths first and last thrice, that makes twelve. For the year has twelve months. Prajapati is the year. He who has such a knowledge thus prospers through these verses which reside in Prajâpati. 

By repeating the first and last thrice, he ties the two ends (knots) of the sacrifice for giving it a hold, and tighten it to prevent it from falling down. 

[88] 30 (The Bringing of Agni and Soma 18 to the Place of the Uttard Vedi.) 

When Agni and Soma are brought, the Adhvaryu calls upon (the Hotar) to repeat appropriate mantras. 

He (first) repeats a verse addressed to Savitar såvir hi deva prathamaya (Asv. Sr. S. 4, 10. Atharv. 7, 14, 3.) They ask: why does he repeat a verse addressed to Savitar, when Agni and Soma are brought ? (The answer is :) Savitar rules over generation. Under the recital of this verse, they (the priests) carry both (Agni and Soma) as being produced by Saritar. Therefore he repeats a verse addressed to Savitar. 

He repeats a verse addressed to Brahmaṇaspati : praitu Brahmanas patih (1,40,3). They ask: why does he repeat a verse addressed to Brahmaņaspati when Agni and Soma are brought? (The answer is ): Brihaspati (the same'as Brahmaṇaspati) is Brahma. By repeating this verse, he makes Brahma the leader (purogava) of both (Agni and Soma), and the sacrificer, being provided with the Brahma, does not suffer any injury. 

1 This is, vişnoh pristham asi. See Taitt Samh. 6, 2, 9. 

* In order to make the removal of Agni-Soma and the Harirdhanas clear it is to be remarked, that first Agni alone is carried to the Uttará Vedi. This ceremony is called Agni-pranayanam. Then the two carts, called Hayirdhanas, filled with ghee, Soma, and after oblations, are drawn by the priests to the place on the right side of the Uttari Vedi. This is the Havirdhana pravarta ram. Then the priests go a third time back to the Prächîna-vamba, and bring Agni (fire), and Soma again. Both, after having been removed from the Prâchina-vamsa, are put down at the gate, facing their former place. The fire is to be put in the Agnidhrîya hearth, in the place of the Uttara Vedi (on the left side), and the Soma in the place called Sadas, near the Aguidhrîya hearth. This ceremony is called : Agni goma-pranayanam. 

[69] By repeating the second half verse (of praitu Brhmanaspatih) pro devi etu sunrita, he provides the sacrifice with a good omen. Thence he repeats a verse addressed to Brahmaṇaspati. 

He repeats a triplet in the Gâyatri metre, which is addressed to Agni : hotà devo amartya (3, 27, 7). 

When the King Soma had been carried once (to the place of the Uttarâ Vedi), then the Asuras and demons sought to kill the king be tween the place called Sadas and the two Havirdhanas. Agni saved him by assuming an illusory form (mâyd), as is said in the words of the mantra (just quoted) : purastâd eti mayaya, i..., he walks before him by assum ing an illusory form. In this way Agni saved Soma. Therefore they hold before him (Soma) fire. 

He repeats the triplet, upa två agne dive (1, 1, 7, 9 11), and the single verse, upa priyam (9, 67, 29). For these two Agnis,' that one which has been taken first, and the other which was brought afterwards, 18 have the power of injuring the sacrificer, when they are fighting (with one another as to whom the oblation belongs). By repeating these three Verses, and the single one (in addition to them), he thus reconciles them in a friendly way, and puts them (back) in their proper places, without any injury being done either to himself or the sacrificer. 

When the oblation is given to the fire, he repeats : agne juşasva prati harya (1, 144, 7). By repeating this verse, he gives (this) oblation to Agni as a "favour" (on account of the term "juşasva, " take it favourably! contained in it). . [70] When the King Soma is carried (to the Sadas) the Hotar repeats the triplet of verses, commencing with : somo jigâti gåtuvid (3, 62, 13-15), which is in the Gayatri metre, and addressed to Soma. By repeating it, he thus makes prosper Soma by means of his own deity (the verses being addressed to Soma) and his own mette (Gâyatrí). The words in the last verse of this triplet)-Somaḥ sadastham ásadat, “ Soma sat on the seat," which express that Soma (at the time of the triplet in question being repeated) is just about taking his seat (in the Sadas), are to be repeated by the Hotar, after having gone beyond the place of the Agnidhriya hearth, when turning his back to it. 

He repeats a verse addressed to Vişņu : tam asya raja rarunas (1, 156, 4), i.e., " the King Varupa and "the Asvins follow the wisdom 

" This first Agni is that one, which was brought to the Uttarâ Vedi, and put in the Nâbhi of it: the other is that one, which was afterwards taken to the Agnidhriya hearth, 

18 This refers to the burnt-offering (homa) which is to be thrown into the Agnidhriya hearth. 

ff of the leader of the Maruts (Vişnu); Vişnu is possessed of the high "est power, by means of which he, surrounded by his friends, uncovers “the stable of darkness (night) to make broad daylight." Vişnu is the door-keeper of the gods. Thence he opens the door for him (for Soma's admission), when this verse is being repeated. 

He repeats : antaścha prágâ aditir (8, 48, 2), when Soma is about to be put in the Sadas. When Soma has taken his seat, the Hotar repeats : syeno na yonim sadanam (9, 71,6), i.e., " the god (Soma) " takes his golden seat just as the eagle is occupying for his residence " a nest wisely constructed ; the hymns fly to him, when comfortably "seated on the grass spread; like a sacrificial horse he runs to the gods." By " golden seat" the black goat skin (on which Soma is put) is to be understood, which covers that which belongs to the gods (their food). 

Thence he repeats this mantra. 

[71] He concludes with a verse addressed to Varuņa : astabhnat dyam asuro (8, 42, 1), i.e., "the living god (Asura) established heaven, "he the all-possessing created the plain of the earth; as their "supreme ruler, he enforces upon all beings those (well-known) laws “of Varuņa (laws of nature, birth and death &c.)." For Soma is in the power of Varuņa, as long as he remains tied up (in a cloth), and wbilst moving in a place shut up (by hanging kusa grass over it). By repeating at that (time) this verse, the Hotar makes him (Soma) prosper through his own deity, and his own metre (Triştubh). 

If some persons should take their refuge with the sacrificer, or should wish for protection from him, the Hotar must conclude with : evd vandasva varunam (8, 42, 2). He who, having such a knowledge, concludes with this verse, secures safety for as many persons as he wishes and contemplates. Thence he who knows it, should conclude with this verse. 

All the seventeen verses which he has repeated on this occasion are complete in their form. What is complete in form, that is to say, when the mantra which is repeated alludes to the ceremony which is being performed, that is successful in the sacrifice. Of these (17 verses) he repeats thrice the first and last; that makes twenty-one. Prajapati is twenty-one fold ; for he consists of twelve months, five seasons, and these three worlds with that Aditya (sun) as the twenty-first. For he is the highest place (on the sky, occupied by Aditya), he is the field of the gods, he is fortune, he is sovereignty; he is the heaven of the bright one (sun), he is the residence of Prajapati; he is independent rule. He (the Hotar) makes the sacrificer prosperous through these twenty-one verses.

FIRST CHAPTER. 

(The Animal Sacrifice.) 

(Erecting of the Sacrificial Post.) The Gods went up to the celestial world by means of this sacri fice. They were afraid that Men and Kişis, after having seen their sacrifice (by means of which they ascended to heaven), might come after (they had gone), and inquire (whether they could not obtain some sacri ficial knowledge). They debarred them? (from obtaining such a know ledge) by means of the Yupa, i.e., the sacrificial post. Thence the Yûpa is called so (from yoyúpayan, they debarred). The gods when going up to the celestial world, struck the Yûpa in (the earth), turning its points downwards. Thereupon Men and Rişis came to the spot where the gods had performed their sacrifice, thinking, that they might obtain some information about the sacrifice). They found only the Yûpa struck in the earth), with its point turned downwards. They learnt that the gods had by this means (i.e., by having struck in the earth the ¥llpa) precluded the sacrificial secret (from being known). They dug the Yûpa out, and turned its points upwards, where [73] upon they got aware of the sacrifice, and beheld (consequently), the celestial world. That is the reason that the Yûpa is erected with its point turned upwards (it is done), in order to get aware of the sacrifice, and to behold the celestial world. 

This Yûpa is a weapon. Its point must have eight edges. For a weapon (or iron club) has eight edges. Whenever he strikes with it an enemy or adversary, he kills him. This weapoi servés) to put down him (every one) who is to be put down by Him (the sacrificer). The Yûpa is a weapon which stands erected (being ready) to slay an enemy. Thence an 

1 The term is : yoyûpayan, which word is only a derivation from yûpa, and proves, in fact, nothing for the etymology of the latter. The author had no doubt the root (yr " to avert, prevent") in view. It is possible that the word is altimately to be traced to this root. The Yüpa itself is a high wooden post, decorated with ribands and erected before the Uttarâ Vedi. The sacrificial animal is tied to it 

enemy (of the sacrificer) who might be present (at the sacrifice) comes out ill after having seen the Yûpa of such or such one. 

He who desires heaven, ought to make his Yûpa of Khâdira wood. For the gods conquered the celestial world by means of a Yûpa made of Khâdira wood. In the same way, the sacrificer conquers the celestial world by means of a Yûpa made of Khâdira wood. 

He who desires food and wishes to grow fat, ought to make his Yüpa of Bilva wood. For the Bilva tree bears fruits every year; it is the symbol of fertility ; for it increases (every year) in size from the roots up to the branches, therefore it is a symbol of fatness. He who having such a knowledge makes his Yûpa of Bilva wood, makes fat his children and cattle. 

As regards the Yüpa made of Bilva wood (it is further to be remarked, that) they call "light" bilva. He who has such á knowledge, becomes a light among his own people, the most distinguished among his own people. 

He who desires beauty and sacred knowledge ought to make his Yûpa of Palasa wood. For the [74] Palása is among the trees beauty and sacred knowledge. He who having such a knowledge makes his Yûpa of Palasa wood, becomes beautiful and acquires sacred knowledge. 

As regards the Yûpa made of Palasa wood (there is further to be remarked, that) the Palasa is the womb of all trees. Thence they speak on account of the paldsam (foliage) of the Palâ sa tree, of the palâśam (foliage) of this or that tree (i.e., they call the foliage of every tree 

He who has such a knowledge obtains (the gratification of) any desire he might have regarding all trees (i.e., he obtains from all trees anything he might wish for). 

(The Ceremony of Anointing the Sacrificial Post). The Adhvaryu says (to the Hotar) : “ We anoint the sacrificial post (Yupa); repeat the mantra (required).” The Hotar then repeats the verse : “ Amjanti tvậm adhvare” (3, 8, 1), i.e., " The priests anoint thee, O tree! with celestial honey (butter); provide (us) with wealth if thou standest here erected, or if thou art lying on thy mother (earth).” The s celestial honey” is the melted butter (with which the priests anoint the Yupa). (The second half verse from) “provide us, " &c., means : "thou mayest stand or lie, ’ provide us with wealth." 

2 The Brâhmanam explains here only the two somewhat obscure verbal forms: tistha and kşayo of the mantra, by tişthâsi (2nd person conjunctive, present tense), and sayasai (2nd person conjunctive, middle voice, present tense), which are in the common Samskrit language equally obsolete: tiştha stands instead of tişthås, 2nd person conjunctive, present tense of the shorter forn, 

51 

(The Hotar repeats the mantra.) Uchchhrayasva, &c. (3, 8, 3), i.e., * be raised, O tree! on the surface of the soil ; thou who hast well lain (on the ground), grant splendour to the carrying up of the [75] sacrifice (to heaven)." This (verse) is appropriate to (the occasion of) erecting the Yûpa (for it contains the words : “ be raised !"). What is appropriate in the sacrifice, that is sure of success. (The words)“ on the surface of the soil" mean the surface of that soil over which they raise the Yåpa. (By the words) “thou hast lain well, grant us,” &c., the Hotar asks for a blessing (from the Yapa). . (The Hotar repeats :) samiddhasya śrayamânah" 13, 8,2), i.e., " placed before the (fire) which is kindled here), thou grantest the Brahma power, which is indestructible and provides with abundance offspring. Stand erected, driving far off our enemies (amati), for our welfare." By the words: "placed before, " &c., he means : placed before it (what is kindled, the fire). By the words : " thou grantest," &c., be asks for a blessing. The wicked enemy (amati) is hunger. By the words: "driving far off," &c., he frees the sacrifice as well as the sacrificer from hunger. By the words : "stand erected, " &c., he asks for a blessing. 

(The Hotar repeats the mantra:, urdhva u şu na utaye (1, 36, 13), i.e., “Stand upright for our protection just as the süngod ! Being raised, be a giver of food, when we invoke thee in different ways (metres), whilst the anointing priests are carrying on (the sacrifice)." (As to the expression), deva na savita, "just as the sungod,” the (particle) na has with the gods the same meaning as om (yes) with these (men) ; ' it means iva, " like as." By the words, [76] "being raised, be a giver of food,” he calls him (the Yûpa) a dispenser of food; he is giving them (men) grain; he dispenses (sanoti) it. The words, "amjayo våghataḥ" (the anointing priests are carrying) mean the metres ; for by their means the sacrificers call the different gods : " Come to my sacrifice, to my sacrifice !” If many, as it were, bring a sacrifice (at the same time), then the gods come only to the sacrifice of him, at which (there is a Hotar), who having such a knowledge repeats this (mantra). 

(The Hotar then repeats :) " urdhvo" nah pahi* (1, 36, 14), i.e., 

* Sâyana refers the demonstrative pronoun eşám to the Vedas. But there is no sufficient proof to show that the three Vedas are hinted at in this demonstrative. It stands in opposition to devânám ; thence it can only refer to men. The meaning of the explanatory remark, that “na has with the gods the same meaning as om (yes), with men," is, that na is here no negative particle, as is generally the case, but affirmative, excluding negation, just as om, which is used for solemn affirmation. 

* This and the preceding verse properly refer to Agni, and not to the Ydpa, as the contents of both clearly show. They form part of a hymn addressed to Agni, They*(Standing) upright proteet us from distress, with thy beams burn down all carnivorous beings (ghosts). Make us (stand) upright, that we may walk and live! Mayst thou as messenger carry (our offerings) to the gods ! The wicked carnivorous beings are the Raksas. He calls upon him (the Yûpa) to burn the wicked Raksas down. (In the second half verse) the word charathaya, " that he might walk,” is equivalent to charandya, " for walking." 

(By the word "to live”) be rescues the sacrificer, even if he should have been already seized, as it were (by death), and restores him to the enjoyment of) the whole year (By the words :) " mayst thou carry," &c., he asks for a blessing. 

(The Hotar then repeats :) " jdto jayate sudinatve, -* &c. (3, 8, 5), i. e., "After having been born, he (the Yüpa) is growing (to serve) in the prime of his life the 1771 sacrifice of mortal man. The wise are busy in decorating (him, the Yüpa) with skill. He as an eloquent messenger of the gods, lifts his voice (that it might be heard by the gods).” Ho (the Yapa) is called jäta, i.e., born, because he is born by this (by the recital of the first quarter of this verse). (By the word) vardhamanalo ise, growing, they make him (the Yûpa) grow in this manner. By the words :) punanti (.e., to clean, decorate), they clean him in this manner. (By the words :) "he as an eloquent messenger, &c.," he announces the Yapa (the fact of his existence), to the gods. 

The Hotar then concludes (the oeremony of anointing the sacrificial post) with the verse " yuvá, suvâsáh parivítah" (3, 8, 4.), i.e., " the youth, decorated with ribands, has arrived ; he is finer (than all trees) which ever grew; the wise prieste, raise him up under recital of well-framed thoughts of their mind." The youth decorated with ribands, is the vital air (the soul), which is covered by the limba of the body. * (By the words :) " he is finer," &c., he. means that he (the Yûpa) is becoming finer (more excellent, beautiful) by this (mantra). By the wise priests (Kavis) those who have repeated the hymns are to be understood. Thus by this (mantra) they raise him up. 

When the Hotar has repeated these seven verses, which are com appear to have been selected for being applied to the Yupa, only on account of the word: * ürdhur," herected, upwarde," being mentioned in them. The Yopa, when standing apright, required mantras, appropriate to its position, and these appear to have been the only available ones serving this purpose. 

• There is a pun between yuva, young, a: youth, and Yupa. By this ** youth "the Yöpa is to be understood. 

* The limbs of the body are to correspond with the ribands to be put on the Yüpa. 

53 

plete in their form (corresponding to the ceremony for which they are used), the sacrifice is made successful ; that is, the form is complete, when the verse recited alludes to the ceremony which is being performed. Of these seven (verses), he recites the first thrice, and the last thrice ; 178) that makes eleven. The Iriştubh (metre) namely consists of eleven sylla bles (i.e., each quarter of the verse). Triştubh is Indra's thunderbolt." He who has such a knowledge prospers through these verses which reside in Indra. By repeating the first and last verses thrice, he ties together both ends of the sacrifice to fasten and tighten them, in order to prevent (the sacrifice) from slipping down. 

(Speculations on the Yüpa, and the Meaning of the Sacrificial Animal.) 

They (the theologians) argue the question : Is the Yûpa to remain standing (before the fire), or is it to be thrown into the fire) ? They answer :) For him who desires cattle, it may remain standing. (About this the following story is reported). Once upon a time cattle did not stand still to be taken by the gods for food. Having run away, they stood still (and turning towards the gods), said repeatedly: You shall not ob tain us ! No! no! Thereupon the gods saw that Yûpa-weapon which they erected. Thus they frightened the animals, which then returned to them. That is the reason, that up to this day, the sacrificial) animals are turned towards the Yûpa, (2.e., the head being bent towards the sacrificial post to which they are tied). Then they stood still to be taken by the gods for their food. The (sacrificial) animals of him who has such a knowledge, and whose Yüpa stands erected, stand still to be taken by him for his food. [79] He (the Adhvaryu) should afterwards throw the Yüpa of that sacrificer who desires heaven (into the fire). For the former (sacrificers) actually used to throw the Yûpa (into the fire), after it had been used for tying the sacrificial animal to it. For the sacrificer is the Yûpa, and the bunch 8 of Darbha grass (prastara) is the sacrificer (also), and Agni is the 

? The Yûpa represents Indra's thunderbolt, see 2, 1. Thence the author is anxiously looking out for a relationship between the Yöpa and anything belonging to Indra. Here he finds it in the circumstance, that, if the repetitions are counted, the number of the mantras required for the ceremony of anointing, raising, and decorating the Yûpa, amounts to eleven, which is the principal number of Indra's sacred metro, Tristubh, 

* At the beginning of the sacrifice the Adhyarya makes of the load of Darbha or sacred grass, which has been brought to the sacrificial compoond, seven muşsis or bun ches, each of which is tied together with a stalk of grass, just as the Baresma (Barsom) of the Parsis. The several names of these seven bunches are : (1) yajamâna muști, the bunch kept by the sacrificer himself in his hand as long as the sacrifice lasts. (2) Three bunches form the Barhis, or the covering of the Vedi on which the sacrificial Vessels are put. These are unloosened and spread all over the Vedi. (3) Praxtara. This 

54 

womb of the gods. By means of the invocation offerings (ahuta), the sacri ficer joins the womb of the gods, and will go with a golden body to the celestial world 

The sacrificers who lived after the ancient ones, observed that the svaru,lo being a piece of the Yûpa (represents the whole of it). He (who now brings a sacrifice) should, therefore, throw it, at this time, afterwards (into the fire). In this way, any thing obtainable through the throwing of the Yûpa (into the fire), as well as that one obtainable through its re maining standing, is obtained. 

[80] The man who is initiated (into the sacrificial mysteries) offers himself to all deities. Agni represents all deities, and Soma represents all deities. When he (the sacrificer) offers the animal to Agni-Soma," he releases himself (by being represented by the animal) from being offered to all deities.12 . 

They say : the animal to be offered to Agni-Soma, must be of two colours, 18 because it belongs to two deities. But this (precept) is not to be attended to. A fat animal is to be sacrificed ; because animals are of a fat complexion, and the sacrificer (if compared with them) certainly lean. When the animal is fat, the sacrificer thrives through its marrow. . They say ; "do not eat from the animal offered to Agoi-Soma." Who eats from this animal, eats from human flesh ; because the sacrificer re 

bunch, which must remain tied, is put over the Darbha of the Vedi. (4) Paribhojani. From: this bunch the Adhvaryu takes a handful out for each priest, and the sacrificer and his wife, which they then use for their seat. [5) Veda. This bunch is made double in its first part, the latter part is cut off and has to remain on the Vedi ; it is called parivasana. The Veda itself is always wandering from one priest to another, and is given to the sacrificer and his wife. It is handed over to the latter only when one of the prieste makes her recite a mantra. In our passage here, prastara cannot mean the bunch which is put on the Vedi, but we must understand by it the Yajamanu musti. 

If the Yüpa represents the sacrificer, then his ascent to heaven is effected by the throwing into the fire of the former. I 10 Svaru means " shavings." A small piece of the Yopa is put into the Juhu (sacrift cial ladle) and thrown into the fire by the words :"may thy smoke go to heaven." 

11 The name of the animal, or animals, sacrificed on the day previous to the Soma festival, as well as that of the day itself, is Agnisaméya. 

The same idea is expressed in the Kauaşîtaki Brihmagan 10, 8. matathatat e मास्यमापयेतेया दीक्षते तयदुपवसयेऽनीषोमीय पशुमालमत प्रात्मनिष्क्रयणो हैवास्यैष तेन पारमानं formarmut wara #dahi aetate , i.e. He who is initiated (into the sacrificial mysteries) falls into the very mouth of Agoi-Soma (to be their food). That is the reason, that the sacrificer kills on the day previous to the Soma festival an animal being devoted to Agai-Soma, thus redeeming himself (from the obligation of being himself sacrifcod.) pe then brings his (Soma) sacrifice after having thus redeemed himself, and become tree from debts. Thence the sacrificer ought not to eat of the flesh of this (animal). 

1: White and black according to Sayana. 

55 

leases himself (from being sacrificed) by means of the animal." But this (precept) is not to be attended to. 

The animal offered to Agni-Soma is an offering to Vșitraghna (Indra). For Indra slew Vritra through Agni-Soma. Both then said to him: “Thou hast slain Vșitra through us, let us choose a boon from thee." Choose yourselves, answered he. Thus they [81] chose this boon from him. Thus they receive (now as their food) the animal which is sacrificed the day previous to the Soma feast. 

This is their everlasting portion chosen by them. Thence one ought to take pieces of it, and eat them. 

(The Apri verses.') The Hotar repeats the Apri verses. These are brightness and sacred knowledge. Through brightness and sacred knowledge the Hotar thus makes thrive the sacrificer. 

[82] (First) he recites a Yâjyâ verse for the wooden sticks (samidhah) which are used as fuel. These are the vital airs. The vital airs kindle 

1* The so called Aprê verses, i.e., Verses of invitation, occupy at the animal sacrifice the same rank which the prayâjas have at the Iştis. By means of them certain divine beings (who do not get any share in the principal part of the sacrifice) are invited and satisfied chiefly with butter. The number of these prayájas or apré verses varies according to the Istis, of which they are the introductory part. At the common Iştis, such as Darśa-purnima, there are five (see Åsv. Śr. S. 1, 5), at the Chaturmâsya-işçi we have nine (Âsy.2, 16), and at the Pasi-isti (the animal sacrifice) there are eleven used (Âśv. 3, 2). The annber of the latter may, however, rise to twelve, and even thirteen (See Max. Müller's History of Ancient Samskrit Literature, p. 464). At all Prayajas, at the common Istis as well as at the sacrificial sacrifice, there is a difference in the second deity. Certain Gotras mast invoke Tanúnapât, others raust choose instead of this deity Narāsamsa. This is distinctly expressed in the words तनूनपादन भाज्यस्य बस्विति द्वितीयो ( Tan: ) ang Tua UHRITT FRAT 29 msgraaf . (ASV, 1,5), t.e., the second Prayâja mantra (at the Darsa Pârşimâ Işti) is : "may Tandpapât, o Agni, taste of this melted butter;" but a different mantra is used by the Vasistas, Sanakas, Atris, Vadhryasvas and individuals belonging to the royal caste. They use the mantra: May Naraśarsu, O Agni! taste of the melted butter!" On the distribution of the ten Apri hymns of the Rigveda Samhita, according to the Gotras, see Max, Müller's History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 466. It clearly follows from this distinction between the invocation of the two deities Tanûnapát and Naráśamsa (both representing a particular kind of Agni), that certain Gotras regarded Tandnapát, others Narasamsa as their tutelary deity, or rather as one of their deified ancestors. These Apri verses seemed to have formed one of the earliest part of the Aryan sacrifices; for we find them in the form of Afriguin also with'the Parsis. See my 'Essays on the Sacred language, Writings and Religion of the Parsis. p. 241. 

* The formula by which each Apri verse is introduced, is az MTA. For each verge there is a separate praisa, 1.6., order, requisite. This is given by the Maitra varuna priest of the Hotar, which always begins with the words area, and the

this whole universe (give life to it). Thus be pleases the vital airs and pats thein into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yájyâ verse for Tanúnapát. The air inhaled (prâna) is Tanûnapat, because it preserves (apat) the bodies (tanvah).' Thus he pleases the air inhaled, and puts it into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yâjyâ verse for Narasamnsa. Nara means offsprings sansa speech. Thus he pleases offspring and speech, and puts them into the sacrificer. 

He repeats the Ydjyâ for Ilah. Ilah means food. Thus he pleases food and puts food into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yajyâ for the Barhis (sacred grass). Barhis is cattle. Thus he pleases the cattle and puts it into the sacrificer, 

He repeats the Yâjyâ for the gates (of the sacrificial place). The gates are the rain. Thus he pleases (fertility) and puts it into the sacrificer. 

He repeats the Yâjyâ for Dawn and Night. Dawn and Night are day and night. Thus he pleases day and night and puts them into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yâjyâ for the two Divine Hotars." [88] The air inlialed and exhaled are the two Divine Hotars. Thus he pleases them and puts them into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yâjyâ for three goddesses." These three goddesses are the air inhaled, the air exhaled, and the air circulating in the body. Thus he pleases them and puts them into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yajyâ for T'vaştår. Tvaştár is speech. Speech shapes (tâşti), as it were, the whole universe. Thus be pleases speech, and puts it into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yâsyå for Vanaspati (trees). Vanaspati is the life. Thus he pleases life and puts it into the sacrificer. 

He repeats a Yajyâ for the Sváhâkritis." These are a firm footing Thus he puts the sacrificer on a firm footing.

He ought to repeat such Apri verses, as are traceable to a Rişi (of the family of the sacrificer). By doing so the Hotar keeps the sacrificer within the relationship (of his ancestors). 

5. [84] (The Carrying of Fire round the Sacrificial Animal.) 

When the fire is carried round2 (the animal) the Adhvaryu says to the Hotar: repeat (thy mantras). The Hotar then repeats his triplet of verses, addressed to Agni, and composed in the Gayatri metre : agnir hota no adhvare (4, 15, 1-3) i.e. (1) Agni, our priest, is carried round about like a horse, he who is among gods the god of sacrifices. (2) Like a charioteer Agni passes thrice by the sacrifice ; to the gods he carries the offering. (3) The master of food, the seer Agni, went round the offerings; he bestows riches on the sacrificer. 

When the fire is carried round (the animal) then he makes him (Agni) prosper by means of his own deity and his own metre." As a horse he is carried” means: they carry him as if he were a horse, round about. Like a charioteer Agni passes thrice by the sacrifice means: he goes round the sacrifice like a charioteer (swiftly). He is called vajapati (master of food) because he is the master of (different kinds of) food. . 

The Adhvaryu says: give Hotar! the additional order for despatching offerings to the god.22 

(85) Then the Maitråvaruņa proceeds to give bis orders by the words : may Agni be victorious, may be grant (us) food! 

They ask: why does the Maitrâvaruņa proceed to give his orders, is the Adhvaryu orders the Hotar, to recite ? (The answer is :) The 

many svähás as there are deities mentioned. The pronunciation of this formula is called sváhakriti. Besides the regalar deities, there are mentioned the devâ â yapä, i.c, the deities who drink melted butter. To make it clear, I write out the fifth Prayaja of the Diksaniya Isti-ये३ यजामहे स्वाहाग्निं स्वाहा सोमं स्वाहासाविष्णू स्वाहा देवा श्राज्यपा TITT 4 FT 647 192: 1.. (may the Gods) for whom we sacrifice, Agni, Soma, Agni Vişnu, and the gods who enjoy melted butter, become pleased and eat of (this) melted butter, “each of them being invited by (Svähâ)"..Sapta hautra. The latter means nothing but well spoken" (the fubnleiv of the Greeks). 

** This ceremony is called paryagnikriya and is performed by the Agnid priest. He takes a firebrand from the Ahavaniya pre and carries it to the right side, thrice round the animal which is to be sacrificed. 

*1 Agni himself is the deity of the hymn in question; it is in Agni's metre, i.ee Gayatri. 

3. This second praisa, or order of one of the Hotars, who is here the Maiträvaruna to the Hotar to repeat his mantras, is called upapraisa At the Animal, as well as at the Sowa sacrifices, the orders for repeating the Yájyâ mantras are given by the Maitre varuņa, As symbol of his power, he receives a stick which he holds in his hand. The Adhyaryo gives at these sacrifices only the order for repeating the Anuvákyas. 

58 

Maiträvaruņa is the mind of the sacrifice; the Hotar is the speech of the sacrifice ; for speech speaks only if driven (sent) by the mind; because an other-minded 10 speaks the speech of the Asuras which is not agreeable to the Devas. If the Maitrâvaruna proceeds to give orders, he stirs up speech by means of the mind. Speech being stirred up by his mind, he secures the offering to the gods (by preventing the Asuras from taking possession of it). 

(The Formula to be Recited at the Slaughter of the Animal. 

See Âøv. Sr. S. 3, 3).11 The Hotar then says (to the slaughterers): Ye divine slaughterers, commence (your work), as well as ye who are human! that is to say, he orders all the slaughterers among gods as well as among men (to com mence). 

Bring hither the instruments for killing, ye who are ordering the sacrifice, in behalf of the two masters of the sacrifice. 1 2 

(86) The animal is the offering, the sacrificer the master of the offering. Thus he (the Hotar) makes prosper the sacrificer by means of his (the sacrificer's) own offering. Thence they truly say: for whatever deity the animal is killed, that one is the master of the offering. If the animal is to be offered to one deity only, the priest should say: medha patayels " to the master of the sacrifice (singular)"; if to two deities, then he should use the dual" to both the masters of the offering," and if to several deities, then he should use the plural "to the masters of the offering,” This is the established custom. 

Bring ye for him fire! For the animal when carried (to the slaughter) saw death before it. Not wishing to go to the gods, the gods said to it: Come, we will bring thee to heaven! The animal consented and said : One of you should walk before me. 

1° If " mind and specch" are unconnected, 

11 It is called the Adhrigu-praişa-mantra, i.e., the mantra by which the Adhrīgu is ordered to kill the animal. The word used for “killor, slaughterer," is " Samiti, " lit, silence-maker. This peculiar torm accurately expresses the mode in which the sacrificial animal is to be killed. They stop its mouth, and beat it soveroly ten or twoive timos on the testicles till it is suffocated. During the act of killing, no voice is to be heard. 

12 Either the sacrificor and his wifo, or the two deities, Agnisomàn, to whom the sacrificial animal is dovotod. Say, says : another Sakhd hag Medha-pataye. In the Kauşîtaki Brahmanara 10, 4, there is also the dual. 

18 This change in the formula is called üha. See Siyana's Introduction to Rigveda, Vol. i., p. 10, 11, ed. Müller, 

They consented. Agni then walked before it, and it followed after Agni. Thence they say, every animal belongs to Agni, for it fol lowed after him. Thence they carry before the animal fire (Agni). 

Spread the (sacred) grass! The animal lives on herbs. He (the Hotar) thus provides the animal with its entire soul (the herbs being supposed to form part of it). 

The mother, father, brother, sister, friend, and companion should give this (animal) up (for being slaughtered)! When these words are pronounced, they seize the animal which is (regarded as) entirely given up by its relations (parents, &c.). 

Turn its feet northwards ! Make its eye go to the sun, dismiss its breath to the wind, its life to the air, its hearing to the directions, its body to the earth. [87] In this way he (the Hotar) places it (connects it) with these worlds. 

Take of the skin entire (without cutting it). Before opening the navel, tear out the omentum! Stop its breathing within (by stopping its mouth)! Thus he (the Hotar) puts its breath in the animals. 

Make of its breast a piece like an eagle, of its arms (two pieces, like) two hatchets, of its forearms (two pieces, like) two spikes, of its shoulders (two pieces, like) two kaśyapas, "1* its loins should be unbroken (entire) ; (make of) its thighs (two pieces, like) two shields, of the two kneepans (two pieces, like) two oleander leaves ; take out its twenty-six ribs according to their order ; preserve every limb of it in its integrity. Thus he bene fits all its limbs. 

Dig a ditch in the earth to hide its excrements. The excrements consist of vegetable food; for the earth is the place for the herbs. Thus the Hotar puts them (the excrements) finally in their proper place. 

Present the evil spirits with the blood! For the gods having de prived (once) the evil spirits of their share in the Haviryajñas (such as the Full-and New-moon offerings) apportioned to them the husks and smallest grains, is and after having them turned out of the great sacri fice (such as the Soma and animal sacrifices), presented to them the blood. Thence the Hotar pronounces the words : present the evil spirits with the blood! By giving them this share he 88 deprives the evil spirits 

" Probably another name for kiirma, i.e., tortoise. See Satapathabrahm. 7,5, 1, 2. 

16 The priest having taken these parts, addresses them as follows: 6 Thou art the share of the evil spirits !"* By these words he throws them below the black goat-skin (always required at the sacrifices.) So do the Apastambas,-Sây. 

60 

of any other share in the sacrifice.18 They say : one should not address the evil spirits at the sacrifice, any evil spirits, whichever they might be (Râkşas, Asuras, &c.); for the sacrifice is to be without the evil spirits (not to be disturbed by them). But others say : one should address them; for he who deprives any one, entitled to a share, of this share, will be punished (by him whom he deprives); and if he himself does not suffer the penalty, then his son, and if his son be spared, then his grandson, will suffer it, and thus he resents at him (the son or grandson) what he wanted to resent at you. 

However, if the Hotar addresses them, he should do so with a low voice. For both, the low voice and the evil spirits, are, as it were, hidden. If he addresses them with a loud voice, then such a one speaks in the voice of the evil spirits; and is capable of producing Rakşas-sounds (a horrible, terrific voice). The voice in which the haughty man and the drunkard speak, is that of the evil spirits (Rakşas). He who has such a knowledge will neither himself become haughty, nor will such a man be among his offspring. 

Do not cut?? the entrails which resemble an owl (when taking out the omentum), nor should among your children, 0 slaughterers ! or among their [89] offspring, any one be found who might cut them. By speaking these words, he presents these entrails to the slaughterers among the gods as well as to those among men. 

The Hotar shall then say thrice : 0 Adhrigu (and ye others), Will (the animal), do it well; kill it, 0 Adhrigåu, After the animal bas been killed, (he should say thrice :) Far may it? 8 (the consequences of murder) be (from us). For Adhrigu among the gods is he who silencesio (the animal) and the Apapa (away, away !) is he who puts it down. By speak 

Www 

? According to the Âpastamba Sutras, the priest takes the thick ends of tho sacrificial grass in his left hand, besmears them with blood, and by the recital of the words, raksasam bhago si, i.e., “thou art the share of the evil spirits," ho shakes it up and down, and pours it out from the middle of the bunch. See also tho Ilira 1r yukesi Srauta Satras, 4, 12. 

17 Råviştha is here to be traced to the root ruşlu, to cut, r being put instead of l, just as we have here uruka instead of ulúka, an owl, Sâyaņa explains : lavanam kuruta. Ravitâ, a catter, and ravat conjunct., are traced by Sây, to the root ru, to roar ; but there is no reason to take the word here in another senso than râviştha in the preceding sentence. 

18 Apápa. This formula is evidently nothing but the repetition of the particle apa, away! It was very early misunderstood, as we may see from the very explanation givon of it by the author of our Brahmaṇam ; for he takes it as upåput, t.e. guiltloss, and makes it the name of one of the divine slaughterers, 

10 He is the proper samitã or silencer. 

01 

ing those words, he surrenders the animal to those who silence it (by stopping its mouth), and to those who butcher it. : . 

The Hotar then mutters (he makes japa): “O slaughterers ! may all good you might do abide by us! and all-mischief you might do go elsewhere." The Hotar 10 gives by (this) speech the order (for killing the animal), for Agni had given the order for killing (the animal) with the same words when he was the Hotar of the gods. ... 

By those words (the japa mentioned) the Hotar removes (all evil consequences) from those who suffocate the animal and those who butcher it, in all that they might transgress the rule by cutting one [90] piece too soon, the other too late, or by cutting a too large,, or a too small piece. The Hotar, enjoying this happiness, clears himself (from all guilt), and attains the full length of his life (and it serves the sacrificer) for obtain ing his full life. He who has such a knowledge, attains the full length of his life, 

(The Animals fit for being Sacrificed. The Offering of the Purodaśa, 

formingpart of the Animal Sacrifice.) The gods killed a man for their sacrifice. But that part in him, which was fit for being made an offering, went out and entered a horse. Thence the borse became an animal fit for being sacrificed. The gods then dismissed that man after that part which was only fit for being offered had gone from him, whereupon he became deformed. 31 

The gods killed the horse ; but the part fit for being sacrificed (the medha) went out of it, and entered an ox; thence the ox became an animal fit for being sacrificed. The gods then dismissed (this horse) after the sacrificial part had gone from it, whereupon it turned to a white deer. 

The gods killed the ox; but the part fit for being sacrificed went out of the ox, and entered a sheep; thence the sheep became fit for being sacrificed. The gods then dismissed the ox which turned to a gayal (bos goaevus). 

The gods killed the sheep ; but the part fit for being sacrificed went out of the sheep, and entered [91] a goat; thence the goat became fit for 

30 The Hotar must recite at the sacrifice the whole formula, from “ Ye divine slaughterers," &c. The whole of it, consisting of many so called Präişas or orders ought properly to be repeated, by the Adhvaryu, who generally calls upon the different priests to do their respective duties. This exception to the rule is here explained by a reference to what Agni, the model Hotar, had once done when oficiating at a sacrifice brought by the gods. 

22 In the original : kimpuruşa. According to the original etymological meaniog, the word signifies a deformed or low man." In later mythology, the Wimpuruşas or kinnaras were attached to Kuvera, the god of treasures, They were regarded as musicians. But this meaning is certainly not applicable here. The author very likely means a dwarf.62 

being sacrificed. The gods dismissed the sheep, which turned to a camel. 

The sacrificial part (the medha) remained for the longest time (longer than in the other animals) in the goat; thence is the goat among all these animals pre-eminently fit (for being sacrificed). 

The gods killed the goat; but the part fit for being sacrificed went out of it, and entered the earth. Thence the earth is fit for being offered. 

The gods then dismissed the goat, which turned to a Sarabha,** 

All those animals from which the sacrificial part had gone, are unfit for being sacrificed, thence one should not eat (their flesh).** 

After the sacrificial part had entered the earth, the gods surrounded it (so that no escape was possible). It then turned to rice. When they (therefore) divide the Purodaba into parts, after they have killed the animal, then they do it, wishing "might our animal sacrifice be per formed with the sacrificial part (which is contained in the rice of the Purodasa)! might our sacrificial part be provided with the whole sacrificial essence!" The sacrificial animal of him who has such a know ledge becomes then provided with the sacrificial part, with the whole sacrificial essence. 

(92) (The Relation of the Rice Cake Offering to that of Flesh. 

The Vapâ and Purodaśa Offerings). 

The Purodása (offered at the animal sacrifice) is the animal which is killed. The chaff and straw of the rice of which it consists are the bairs of the animal, its husks *s the skin, its smallest particles the blood, all the fine particles to which the (cleaned) rice is ground (for making, by kneading it with water, a ball) represent the flesh (of the animal), and whatever other substantial parts is in the rice, are the bones (of tbe animal). He who offers the Purodása, offers the sacrificial substance of all animals (for the latter is contained in the rice of the Purodada). Thence they say: the performance of the Purodása offering is to be attended to. 

W

33 A fabulous animal, supposed to have cight legs, and to kill lions. 

** That is to say : all beings who owe their origin to a loss of tho sacrificial part in a highor species of the same class, such as the dwarf, the gayal, the camel, &c., aro unit to be used as food. Here is a hint given as to wby certain animals are allowed and otlors prohibited to be eaten. We see from this passage clearly, that animal food w39 very extensively used in the Vedic times. 

3* The busks, turn, fall off when the rice is beaten for the first time; the thinnest particles, which fall off, when the grains are completely made bare and white by couti nuce beating, are called phalzkaraizas. 

* Kiñchitkan säram. Kifichitaka is an adjective of the indeünite pronouo Kiüchit, having, as say. remarks, the sense of “ all." 

Now he recites the Yâjga for the Vapà (which is about to be offered): yuvam etani divi, i.e. Ye, O Agni and Soma, have placed, by your joint labours, those lights on the sky! ye, Agni and Soma, have liberated the rivers which had been taken (by demons, from imprecation and defile ment. (Rigveda 1, 93, 5.) 

The man who is initiated into the sacrificial mystery (the Dikşita) is seized by all the gods (as their property). Thence they say: he should not eat of a thing dedicated (to the gods).*8 . But others say: he should eat when the Vapâ is offered; for the Hotar [931 liberates the sacrificer from the gods by (the last words of the mantra just mentioned): “Ye, Agni and Soma, have liberated the (rivers) which bad been taken.” Consequently, he becomes a sacrificer (a yajamâna), and ceases to belong as a Dikşita exclusively to the gods."? 

Now follows the Yâjyâ verse for the Purodânsa (mentioned, : anyam divo mátarisvä (1, 93, 6), i.e., Mâtariávà brought from heaven another (Soma), ** and the eagle struck out another (Agni, fire) of the rock, &c. (On account of the meaning of the last words " and the eagle," &c., the verse is used as Yâjyâu for the Purodâba offering.) For it expresses the idea, that the sacrificial essence had gone out and had been taken away (from man, horse, &c.), as it were, just as (Agni) had come out (of the rock). 

With the verse : Taste (О Agni) the offerings, burn them well, &c., (3, 54, 22), the Hotar makes the Sviştakrit of the Purodaśa. By this mantra the Hotar makes the sacrificer enjoy such an offering (to be granted by the gods in return for the gift), and acquires for himself food and milky essences. 

He now calls the Iļd (and eats from the Purodada). For Ilâ means cattle ; (by doing so) he therefore calls cattle, and provides the sacrificer with them. 

** The text offers some dificulties; it literally means : he should not eat of the Dîksita, which latter word can here not be taken in its usual sense, “one initiated into the sacrificial rites," but in that of a thing consecrated to the gods. Såy. gets over the difficulty by inserting the word grihe after diksitasya, and understands it of a meal to be taken in the house of a sacrificer when the Vapà offering is performed. 

** As a Yajamāna, he is allowed to eat again. * 38- This refers to the legend of Soma being abstracted from heaven by the Gayatri, in the shape of an eagle, or by Matariáva, the Promethens of the Vedic tradition. See Kuhn, Die Herabkunft des Feuers und Göttertranics. Ait. Br. 8, 25-27.

10. (The Offering of Parts of the Body of the Animal. The Manota). 

Tbe Adhvaryu now says (to the Hotar) : recite the verses appropriate to's the offering of the [94] parts of the sacrificial animal which are cut off for the Manotâ. ** He then repeats the hymn : Thou, O Agni, art the first Manotâ (6, 1). This hymn being exclusively devoted to Agni), and the sacrificial animal belonging to another deity (besides Agni, viz., Soma), they ask : Why does he recite verses, (exclusively) addressed to Agni, when the sacrificial parts (of the animal) intended for the Manotâ are being cut off ? (The answer is :) There are three Manotds among the gods, in which all their thoughts are plotted and woven, viz., Vâch (speech), Gaus (the cow), and Agni, in every one of whom the thougbts of the gods are plotted and woven ; but Agni is the complete Manota (the centre for all [95] thoughts); for in him all Manotâs are gathered. For this reason the priest repeats verses as anu vakyâs addressed to Agni at that occasion. By the verse: "O Agni-Soma, eat the food which is waiting (for you) &c. (1, 93, 7)," he makes the Yâjyâ to the offering, This verse ensures, on account of the words "food" (havişo) and "waiting for you" (prasthitasya), success. For the offering of him who has such a know 

39 After the Vapå (omentum) and the Purodása, which forms part of the aniıral sacrifice have been thrown into the fire, tho Adkvaryus offor different parts of tho body of the slaughtered animal Most of them are put in tho Juhadlo, somo in the Unabhritir For the Adhvaryu generally holds, when giving an oblation, tro ladles, Juba and Upnbhrit, in his hand, placing the first over the latter. The names of the parts of the body which are to be sacrificed, are differently stated in the Katiya (0,7, 0-11) and Hiranyankesi Sutras (4, 14), but they appear to moan always the same parts. They arc : tho heart tongue, tho breast, the two sides (with the ribs which are not to be broken), the liver (called yakrat în Kat., and taniman in the Hiranyankoái and Baudhayana Sutras), the two reins (vakiau in the K., ata nu in the H. and B. Sutran), the loft shouldor blaclo (84q11cm dos in H. and B., savyasakthipúr-vanadulam in K.), the right part of the loins, tuo middlo part of the anus. These are put in the Juha. The remainder, the right shoulder binde, the third part of the anus which is very small, and the loft part of the loins aro yut in tho Upabhrít. Besides the penis (rarşiştice), the straight gut (zanixthur), and the tail are cut off for being sacrificed. If the parts to be given with tho Juho and Upahlırit are fried and dripped over with melted butter, then is the Hotar ordored to ropeat tho Anuvaky: mantra by the words : manotâyái haviso avadiyamanasya anubrizhi, 1.f", "repoat mantra to the offering, which has been cut off for tho Manoti." This offering which is called the angayága, is givon to the Manota, the weaver of thoughts, who is said to be Agni. 

*0 Tho word is explained by Sayana as a compound of man and ota, which moans, literally, the" weaving of thoughts," that is, the seat of intolligence. IIere it is used as : feminino ;' but in the hymn referred to, it is evidently a masculina : prathunud meheti, * the first weaver of thoughts," which means about the same as the first poet er priosti, another denomination of Agni. 

ledge ensures success and goes to the gods (only) by means of all parts of a particular ceremony being well performed. 81 

He gives an offering to Vanaspati"* (the vegetable [98] kingdom). Vanaspati is the vital air; therefore, the offering of him who, knowing this, sacrifices to Vanaspati, goes endowed with life to the gods. 

He gives an offering to the Sviştakrit.** The Sviştakrit is the footing on which he finally places the sacrificer. 

si The verses should be always in accordance with the sacrificial act. 

82 The offering of melted butter to Vanaspati (in form of the Yapa) takes place immediately after the so-called vasáhoma, or the offering of the water in which entrails (heart, &c.) of the slaughtered animal have been fried. In the Apastamba Satras, the performance is thus described as Sây, mentions. The Adhvaryu puts a plant on the Juha (large ladle), takes once liquid ajyå (relted butter), drips it twice about it (the plaat), and says to the Hotar: address Vanaspati. He then first repeats an Anuvâkyâ : devebhyo vanaspataye. I give here tue text of this mantra, which I found in its entirety only la the Sapta-hå atra prayoga. 

देवेभ्यो वनस्पत हवींषि हिरण्यपर्ण प्रदिवस्ते धर्थम् । प्रदक्षिणिदशनया वियूय ऋतस्य वधि एथिभी रजिष्टोम् ॥ i, e., Mayst thou, o tree (the Yapa), with golden leaves of old, who art quite straight after having been freed from the bonds (with which thou wert tied), carry up, on the paths of right, turning towards the south, the offerings for thy own sale to the gods! (The "bonds" refer to the cord with which the animal was tied to the Yüpa ; they are to be taken off. The golden leaves refer to the decoration of the Yüpa with ribands. “ Bor thy own sake;" this offering belongs to himself.) 

After the Hotar has repeated this Apuvákya, the Maiträvaruņa thon gives the praiga (orders) to repeat the Yajpå mantra by the words : GT JH , &c. (See the mantra in full in the Vajasaneya Samh. 21, 46, with some deviations.) 

The Hotar thereupon repeats the Yájyâ mantra, which raus as follows: 

ये ३ यजामहे । वनस्पते रशनया नियूय पिष्टतमया वयुननानि विद्वान् ॥ वह देवत्रा विधियो हवींषि प्रबहातारममृतेषु वोचा । वौषट। O tree! after having been loosened from the nicely decorated cord, thou, who art experi enced in wisdom and knowledge, carry up to the gods the offerings, and proclaim to the immortals the (name of the) giver! 

- 88 After the oblation to Vanaspa ti follows that to Agni Svislakrit, including all the deities of the animal sacrifice, viz., Agni, Soma, Agni-Somar, Indrágni, Asvindu' Vanaspati, Deva ajyapã (deities which drink melted butter). The Anuvâkyå of the Sviştakit oblation is at the animal sacrifice the same as at other Iştis, viz: fale at(Rigveda 10, 1, 2, Äsv. Ér. S. 1, 8). Then follows the praişa by the Maiträvaraga, where the names of all the deities of the Işti (as given above) are mentioned. It runs as follows: 

होता यक्षदग्नि स्विष्ठकृतमयाल अग्निरग्नेराज्यस्य हविषः प्रिया धामान्ययाट सोमस्याज्यस्य विषः प्रिया धामान्ययालनीषोमोरछागस्य हविषः प्रिया धामान्ययालिंगागन्योछागस्य हविषः प्रिया धामान्यया खश्विनोश्छागस्य हविषः प्रिया धामान्ययाडवनस्पतेः प्रिया पाधास्थयाट देवानामाज्यपानां प्रिया धामानि यक्षदग्नेहातुः प्रिया धामानि यक्षस्वं माहिमानमायजतामज्या इषः कृणोतु सो अध्वरा जातवेदा जुषती gratis Sapta Hautra (compare Vajasaneya S. 21, 47. On the form of the Svistakrit, GoG Ämy, Ér. 6, 1, 0), The YAjpå mantra is : gra qeu (4, 15, 14) which is preceded by

SECOND CHAPTER. (The Remaining Rites of the Animal Sacrifice. The Prâtar-anuváka). 

11. (Why fire is carried round the sacrificial animal.) The Devas spread the sacrifice. When doing so, the Asuras attacked tbem, intending to put an obstacle in their way (to prevent the successful performance of the sacrifice). The attack was made against the sacrificial post from the eastern direction, after the animal had been consecrated by the Apri verses (see 2, 4), and before the fire was carried round the animal. The Devas awoke, and surrounded, for their own protection, as well as for that of the sacrifice (the place) with a three-fold wall resembling fire. The Asuras seeing those walls shining and blazing, did not venture an attack, but ran away. Thus the Devas defeated the Asuras on the eastern side as well as on the western. For this reason the sacrificers perform the rite of carrying fire round (the animal, when consecrated), and have a mantra recited; for they thus surround (the animal) with a three-fold wall, shining like fire, for their own protection and that of the sacrifice. 

After the animal is consecrated, and fire carried around it, they take it northwards. They carry before it a firebrand, meaning thereby that the animal is ultimately the sacrificer himself ; they believe that he will go to heaven, having that light (the firebrand) [98] carried before him. And in this way he really goes to heaven. 

The Adhvaryu throws sacred grass (barhis) on the spot where they are to kill the animal. When they carry it outside the Vedi, after having consecrated and carried fire round it, they make it sit on the sacred grass (barhis). 

the águr : 93 ZARE, and followed by tho Vanatkâra. One of tho rules laid down for the Svistakrit mantras and the respective praigas, as far as they aro not tairen from the Sanhits of Rigvoda, is, that all the deities of the Isti must be mentioned along with the expression : fra 19, i e., beloved rosidenco; the namo of the doity always procedes it in the genitive. 

$ After the Sviştakrit is over, the remainder of the offorings, which aro at the animal sacrifice, flesh is eaton by the priests and tho sacrificor, Tho I natra in which the dish is placed is held up and Ilf, the personification of food, called to appear. This "calling," of Ila is always the same. The formula is given in tho Âsvul, Sr. Sotras 1,7 : 

पहहूता सह दिबा० 1 Agnidhra is performing this rito. Scc 2, 5, 

They dig a ditch for its excrements. The excrements consist of herbs; the earth is the proper place for herbs; thus he puts them at the end 

in their proper place (by throwing them into a ditch, dug in the earth). 

They say : when the animal is the offering, then many parts (of this offering) go off (are not used), such as hairs, skin, blood, half-digested food, hoofs, the two horns, some pieces of flesh which fall to the ground. (Such being the case) in what way then is the deficiency made up? The answer is : if they sacrifice Purodása, divided into its proper parts along with the animal, then the animal sacrifice is made complete. When the sacrificial essence had gone from the animals, both rice and barley sprang out of it. When they offer Purodåsa, divided into its proper parts along with the animal, then they should think, “our animal was sacrificed with the sacrificial essence in it; our animal has been sacrificed in its entirety." 

The animal of him who has this knowledge is sacrificed in its entirety, 

12. 

(The Offering of the Drops which fall from the Omentum). After the Vapå (omentum) has been torn out of the belly), they bring it (to the fire for being fried). The Adhvaryu. causes to drip out of a Sruva drops of hot melted butter. When the drops are falling [99] (to the ground), the Adhvaryu orders the Hotar to recite the mantra appropriate to the drops (falling down). For the drops belong to all deities. He might think, they are not mine. (I, the priest, have nuth ing to do with them); they may, therefore, uninvited go to the gods; (but he ought to repeat mantras for them). 

He repeats the Anuvâkyâ (for the drops :) "Be favourable to our loud voice (to be heard at a distance) which is agreeable to the gods, when swallowing our offerings with thy mouth! (1, 75, 1.)! By this mantra he throws the drops into the mouth of Agni. He further repeats the hymn: "Bring this our sacrifice among the gods” (3, 21). By the words (of the second pada of the first verse :)“ be favourable to our offer ings, O Jâtavedas !" he begs for the acceptance of the offerings. In the words in the third pada of the first verse :) "eat, О Agni, the drops of the marrow * (and the) melted butter," the drops of the marrow and the melted butter are mentioned. The words (of the fourth pada of the first verse :) "eat, O Hotar, having first taken thy seat !" mean: Agni (for he is the Hotar of the gods) eat, after having taken, &c. 

(In the first half of the second verse :) “ the drops of melted butter drip for thee, O purifier, from the marrow," the drops both of the melted 

+ Rv medas. NãV. understands the Vapi, which is ceatainly the right explanation 

butter and the marron are mentioned. (By the second half :) grant us the best things which are desirablo, for worshipping (thee) in the proper way," he pronounces a blessing. 

(In the first half of the third verse :) "O! Agni! these drops are dripping melted butter for thee, the wise, who art to be worshipped with gifts," the drops (of marrow) are described as “ dripping melted butter." [100] (By the second half:) "thou, the best Rişi art kindled; be a carrier of the sacrifice !" he (the priest) orders the sacrifice to be successful. 

(In the first half of the fourth verse :) "to thee, O Adhrigu! drip the drops of marrow and melted butter, O Agni! thou strong one !" the drops both, of the marrow and melted butter, are mentioned. (By the second half :) "mayst thou, praised by poets, come (to us) with thy brightly shining flame! kindly accept our offerings, O wise !" the priest asks the acceptance of the offerings, 

(After the recital of the fifth verses :) " we offer to thee the most juicy marrow (the Vapâ), taken out of the midst of the belly); these drops (of inelted butter) drip on this thin skins (the Vapâ), carry them severally up to the gods !" the priest pronounces the formula Váuşat! for the drops (and thus concludes the offering of the drops). 

He then repeats the same formula (the Anuyaşatkâra as is sacrificing the Somal, O Agni, enjoy the Soma! (using instead of “Soma" the word " drops.") These drops belong to all the gods. Thence the rain falls, divided in drops, down upon the earth. 

18. (On the Svahákritis and the Offering of the Vupd). They ask: which are the Puronuvákyâs, the Praişas and the Yajyas for the call: Svahî 4 ? (The (101) answer is :) The Pironurakyis 

3 From this passage it is clear that by medas in the whole of this hymn, the Vape or omentum is to be understood; for it is called here tuach, i.Cry skin, which (although it is very thin) it resembles. 

" The author of the Brâhm. alludes hore to a practice which appoars to be contrary to the general rules established regarding the offering of oblations. To maka it clear, I here extract the passage concerning it from the Manual, used by tho seven Hotri priests (called Sapta Tautra). On pp. 22, 23 of my manuscript is said, that the Hotar, after having repeated the hyon addressed to the drops dripping from tho Vapa, is re quested by the Maiträvaruna (who then gives the praiya, 1.6. order) to make the Sváhas (svahdilaritit, ie, the pronunciation of the formula : svaha ! of the ajya, tho medus (Vapå) of the drops dripping from the Vapi, of the Svaltītcritis in general, and of the verses which are addressed to tho oblations in the hymn mentioned (imam 10 Yajnan, 3, 21, see above). This order tho Maitrâ rarupa concludes hy the words : "Svala! the gods pleased with the Âjyi may first taste the Âjya ! Hotar, repeat the YAJYA !" Thereupon the Maiträvaruna repeats & Puronuvákya for the offering of two portions of Ajra. Then tho Maitråraruga orders the Hotar to recite two Ydjylu, one for Agni, the other for Soma, 

are just the same as those recited (for the drops), the Praigas and the Yajyas are also the same. They further ask; which are the deities for these Svâhâ kritis ? (To this) one should answer, the Visve devdh; for there are (at the end) of the Yâjyâ the words, "may the gods eat the oblation over which Svâhân! is spoken." 

The gods conquered by means of the sacrifice, austerities, penances, and sacrificial oblations the heavenly world. After the Vapâ had been offered, the heavenly world became apparent to them. Regardless of all the other rites, they went up to heaven by means of the oblation of the Vapâ (alone). Thereupon Men and Risis went to the sacrificial place of the gods (to see) [102] whether they might not obtain something worth knowing. Having gone round about and searched all the place, they found nothing but a disembowelled animal lying there. Thence they learnt that verily the value of the animal ( for sacrifices) consists only in its Vapa, which part is just as much as the whole animal. 

When they, at the third libation, fry the remaining portions (all save the Vapâ) of the animal and offer them, then they do so, wishing, "may our sacrifice be performed with many many oblations! may our sacrifice be performed with the entire animal !" 

14. The oblation of the Vapà is just like an oblation of ambrosia ; such oblations of ambrosia are (besides) the throwing of the fire : (produced by the friction of wooden sticks) into the sacrificial bearth, the oblation of Ajyê and that of Soma. All these oblations are without an (apparent) body (they disappear at once when thrown into the fire). With such bodiless obla tions the sacrificer conquers the heavenly world. The Vapá is just like sperm ; for just as the sperm (when effused) is lost in the womb), the Vapâ is lost (disappears in the fire on account of its thinness). Further, the Vapâ is white like sperm, and, without a substantial body, just as 

in order to induce these deities to accept the offering given after the recital of the Yaiya. After having repeated then, he is ordered to repeat the Yåjfå for the medas (Vapa), addressing Agnisomar, 

Now the deviation from the general adopted rules of the sacrificial practice is, tho formula Svähâ is here several times used without having a proper Apuvákya and Yajvå. To this practice some performers of sacrifices had raised some objections. But the author of our Brahm, defends the practico, asserting that the Puronuyakyås required for the Svåhâkritis are incladed in those mentioned for the drops (p. 99), their praişa is contained in the general praisa, in the words : hotar agnim yakrat, may the Hotar recite the Ydiyd for Agni! &c, which formula the different Svå has follow, one of which is, Sváha sváhálcritinám (see above); and their Yajya comprised in the general Yajya, which is according to the Äsvaldy. Satr, 3, 4, the last verse of the Aprisikta. 

* See AitBr, 1, 15. 

HUSY 

sperm, Blood and flesh making up the substance of the hody, the Hotar therefore should say (to the Adhvaryu): cut off all that has no blood. 

The Vapâ oblation must consist of five parts, even if there are only four parts (all except the gold plate) at the sacrificer's disposal. The priest first puts o melted (103) butter for the Vapâ in the ladle, then follows a thin gold plate, the Vapâ, the melted butter for the gold plate, and (lastly) the dripping of melted butter (on the whole). 

They ask : if there is no gold to be had, what should he do then ? (The answer is :) he should first put twice melted butter in the ladle. then the Vapà, and drip twice hot melted butter on it. The melted butter is ambrosia, the gold is also ambrosia. Therefore everything wished for (by the sacrificer) when throwing the melted butter and the gold (into the ladle), is attaiņable. Together with the melted butter (to be taken twice), and the gold, the Vapå oblation consists of five parts.? 

Man is composed of five parts, viz. hairs, skin, flesh, bones, and marrow. The priest having (by the Vapâ oblation) made (the sacrificer) just such a man (composed of five parts), offers him in Agni, who is the womb of the gods. For Agni is the womb of the gods; after having grown together in Agni's womb with the (different other) oblations, he then goes up to heaven with a golden body. 

15. 

(On the Repetition of the Prâtar-anuvâka, or Early Morning Prayer, 

on the Day of the Soma Libation.) The Adhvaryu orders the Hotar to repeat the mantras appropriate for the gods who appear in the early morning. These gods are Agni, Uşas (dawn), and the Asvins (twilight); they come, if each of them is addressed in mantras of seven different (104) metres. They come on the call of him who has such knowledge. 

As Prajapati, when he himself was (once) Hotar, was just about to repeat the Prätar-anuvâ ka, in the presence of both the Devas and Asu ras, he first thought, he will repeat the Prâtar-anuvâka for our benefit; the latter believed, he will do so for us. He then repeated it for the Devas. Thence the Devas became masters of the Asuras. He who has such a knowledge becomes master of his enemy, adversary, and 

• The technical term for this proceeding is upa-stararam. * The two others are the Vapà itself and the hot melted butter dripped on it. 

\# To each of these three deities are mantras in the following seven motres addressed : Gayatri, Anustup, Tristup, Brihati, Uşnih, Jagati and Pankti. 

gainsaper. It is called Pritar-anuvâka (morning prayer); for Prajapati prayed it early in the morning. It is to be repeated in the dead of night. For people follow in their sayings him, who possesses the whole speech, and the full Brahma, and who has obtained the leader 

ship, 10 

Therefore, the Prâtar-anuvâka is to be repeated in the dead of night: for it must be repeated before people commence talking. Should be, however, repeat the Prâtar-anuvâka after people have commenced talking, he would make the Prâtar-anuvâka (which should be the first speech uttered in the morning) follow the speech of another. Such being contrary to its nature) it must be repeated in the dead of night. He should repeat it even before the voice of the cock is heard. '1 For all the birds, including the cock, are the [105] mouth (the very end) of the goddess Nirriti (destruction, death.) If he thus repeats the Prâtar-anuvâ ka before the voice of the cock is heard, (he should do so considering) that we cannot utter the sacred words re quired at a sacrifice, should others already (animals or men) have made their voices heard. Thence (to avoid this) the Prâtar-anuvâka should be repeated in the dead of night. Then verily the Adhvaryu should begin his ceremonieska (by calling on the Hotar to repeat the Prâtar-anuväka), and the Hotar then should repeat it. When the Adhvaryu begins his work (by ordering the Hotar to repeat), he begins with Speech, and the Hotar repeats (the Prâtar-anuvâka) through Speech. Speech is Brahma. Thus every wish which might be attainable either by Speech or Brahma's is attained. 

16. Prajapati being just about to repeat the Prâtar-anuváka, when he was himself Hotar (at his own sacrifice), all the gods were in a state of anxious expectation, as to who of them would be first mentioned. Praja pati looked about (and, seeing the state of anxiety in which the gods were, thought), if I commence by addressing (the mantra) to one deity only, 

» This appears to be the meaning of: mahati ratryan. Sây. explains it rather artificially as the great portion of the night following the day on which the animal sacrifice for Agnizomiya had been performed. 

10 The anthor alludes here to the relation of subjects to the king, and of pupils to their teacher, 

11 By sakuni only the cock is to be understood. The original form being kakuni, we are reminded of the very word "cock." Great importance is attached to this bird in the Zend-Avesta, where it is named paro-dars. 

12 The term used is, upákaroti. 

13 Bây. understands here by speech the worldly common talk, by Brahma the sacred speech, the repetition of the mantras.how will the other deities have a share (in such an invocation)? He then $&w (with his mental eyes) the verse : âpô revatir, i.e., the wealthy waters (10, 30, 12). Åpo, i.e. waters, means all deities, and revatih (rich) means also all deities. He thus commenced the Prâtar-anuvâka by this verse, at which all the gods felt joy : (for each of them thought), he first has men tioned me; they all then felt [106] joy when he was repeating the Prâtar anuvâka. He who has such a knowledge (i.e., who commences his Prêtar anuvâka by the same verse), commences his Prâtar-anuvâka with a joint address to all the gods. 

The Devas were afraid of the Asuras robbing them of their early morning sacrifice (the Prâtar-anuvâka), for they (the Asuras) were so very strong and powerful. But Indra said to them : "Do not be afraid! I shall strike them with the three-fold power of my morning thunderbolt." He then repeated the verse mentioned (10, 30, 12). This verse is in three respecte a thunderbolt, viz., it contains " the destroying waters'1% (apô rap tryő), it is in the Triştubh (Indra's metre, and it contains "speech"): (it is recited with a loud voice). With this thunderbolt he struck and destroyed them. Thence the Devas became masters of the Asuras. He who has such a knowledge, becomes master of his enemy, adversary, and gainsayer. 

They say: he should be the Hotar who produces in this verse (when reciting it) the number containing all metres. This is the case, if it be repeated thrice. This is the production of the metres. 

17. He who wishes for long life, should repeat a hundred verses. For the (full) life of man is a hundred (years); he has (besides) a hundred powers, and a hundred senses." (By repeating one hundred verses) [107], the priest secures to the sacrificer his full age, his (mental and bodily) powers, and his senses. 

He who wishes for performing successfully the subsequent great) sacrifices, should repeat 360 verses. For the year consists of 360 days; such a year (is meant here). The year is Prajapati. Prajapati is the sac rifice. The intelligent Hotar who recites 360 verses, turns (in this way) the sacrifice (regarded as a divine being, the mediator between gods and men) towards the sacrificer. 

"In the Anukramaniká, the deity of the song in which this verso occurs, is called Apo naptryah. 

** Vách has the power of destroying, under certain circumstances, the sacrificer. 

* According to say, the number of " a hundred " for the gapses is to be obtained. if the senses aro stated at ten, and if to each of tller tea tubular vessels, in which they moy, are asoribed. 

He who wishes for children and cattle, should repeat 720 verses. For so many days and nights make a year (one of 360 days). Prajapati is the year. For, after he is produced (prajayamâna), the whole universe is pro duced (prajayate).!? He who has such a knowledge, obtains, if being born after Prajâpati (by means of the sacrifice), children and cattle. 

If any one who is not recognized as a Brahman, or one who has a bad reputation on account of being charged with crimes, should bring a sacrifice, then 800 verses should be repeated. The Gayatri consists of eight syllables (three times eight). The gods being of the nature of the Gâyatrî, removed the evil consequences of sin and crime. He who has such a knowledge, removes the evil consequences of sin and crime from himself by means of the Gâyatri. 

He who wishes for heaven, should repeat a thousand verses. For the heavenly' world is at a distance of about 1,000 days' travelling on horse 'back from here (this earth). (To repeat a thousand verses, is done) for reaching the heavenly world everywhere. (He who then wishes) for acquisition of things to be enjoyed, and of communion (with the gods), should recite an unlimited number of verses). For Prajâpati is [108] boundless. To Prajapati belongs the recitation which makes up the Prâtar-anuvâka. Therein are all desires contained. When he repcats an unlimited number (it is done) to obtain fulflment of all desires. He who has such a knowledge, obtains fulfilment of all wishes. 

Thence one should repeat an unlimited's number (of verses). He repeatş verses of seven (kinds of) metres for Agni, for there are seven worlds of the gods. He who has such a knowledge hecomes successful in all of them. He repeats verses of seven (kinds of metres) for Uşas; for there are seven (kinds of) cattle?' in villages. He who has such a knowledge, obtains these seven (kinds of) cattle in the villages. 

He repeats seven (kinds of verses) for the Asvins; for Speech spoke in seven (different tones). In as many tones (2.e., seven) then spoke Speech (in all made men). These seven tones are made) for comprising the whole speech (the worldly talk and singing), the whole Brabma. He repeats verses for three deities; for three worlds are three-fold. (This repetition therefore serves) for conquering (all) these worlds of the gods. 

1He is the creator, 18 As many as a Hotar can repeat from after midnight to sunrise. 

1# Such as goats, sheep, cows, horses, asses, camels, &c. As the seventh kind, Apastam ba counts man,

18. They ask : how should the Prâtar-anuvâka be repeated ? It is to be repeated *according to the metres (verses of the same metre to be put together). The metres are the limbs of Prajapati. He who brings the sacrifice is Prajâpati. For the benefit of the sacrificer, the several verses of the Prâtar-anuvâka are to be recited pada (foot) by pada." For cattle (109) have four feet, (if he do so) he obtains cattle. He should repeat it by half verses. When he repeats it in this way, (then he does so for securing) a footing (to the sacrificer). Man has two legs, and animals have four. He thus places the two-legged sacrificer among the four-legged animals. ** 

Thence he should repeat the Pråtar-anuvâka only by half verses. 

They ask : the (metres of the) Prâtar-anuvâka being developed, as how do they become then undeveloped ? The answer should be : if the Brihati metre is not moved from its centre. 

Some deities have a share in the invocation offerings, others in the Stomas (the chants of the Sâma singers), others in the metrical verses) (chhandas) repeated by the Hotar). By means of the invocation offerings (anutis), one makes pleased those deities who have a share in these offerings, and, by means of the chants and recitations, those also who have their 

ros in the Stomas and metres. He who has such a knowledge, makes pleased and well-disposed to be parties of deities (those who have their share in the invocation offerings, and those who have theirs in the Stomas and metres). 

(110) There are thirty-threo gods who drink Soma and thirty-three who do not drink Soma. 

The Soma-drinking gods are : eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve

28 Ásv. Sr. Satr. 4, 13 The regular order of motres which commencos by Gayatri and goes on by Usnib, Anustubh, &c., based on the increase by four syllables of cach subsoquent metre, is not kept in the Prâtar-annvaka. Unih is her. not second, hut fifth ; Aunnţublu is second Tho expression vyuilia means, ono metro boing produced by an increase of the number of syllables out of the preceding metre. Thus increase in the Prilar-anuváka goes as far as the fourth inentre, tlie Brihati, which is the centro ; then the turn from the lower number to the higher commences again. The first turn is Gayatri, Anu-tubh, Trintubh, and Brihati-; the second Urnih, Jagati, and Paikti. There being after the Brihati a roturn to lower numbers. tho Invelopmoont is stoppail: thener the Pratar anuraka is azyıtlı also,

Adityas, Prajapati and Vaşat-kåra. The not-Soma-drinking gods are : eleven Prayâjas,** eleven Anuyâjas, 95 and eleven Upayâjas.** They [111] have their sbare in the sacrificial animal. With Soma, he pleases the Soma-drinking deities ; with the animal, those who do not drink Soma. Thus, he who has such a knowledge, makes both parties pleased and well disposed. 

24 These are the eleven verses of the Apri hymns, see 2,4. 

20 At the animal sacrifice, there are eleven Anuyajas required. This is briefly stated in Âsv. Ér. Satras 4,6, where, however, in addition to those occurring at a previous sacriüce (Châturmâsya Işti), only two are mentioned ; and on refere .ce to the rules on the Châturmasya Isti (2, 16), wo find also, in addition to three which are supposed to be already known, only six mentioned. The three primitive ones aro then to be found in the Fules on the Darsa paroima-iştis (1,8). The formula is for all Anugâjas the same First comes the name of the respective deity in the nominative, then follow the words : Vasuvane vasudheya sya vetit (or vitâm, or vyantif). The first Anugāja, which is addressed to the barhis, or sacrificial seat, runs for instance, as follows : 9 afegea agerata ip.“may the divine sacrificial seat, giver of wealth (Àgni) ! taste of the wealth. (food) which is to be put by." The latter expression refers to the remainder of the sacrificial tood which had been eaten by the priests and the sacrificer just before the offering of the Anuyajas. The gods are to have a share in the food already eaten. Food is regarded as the wealth to be put by; for it serves for the acquisition of vigour and strength. The term vasu is frequently used with reference to food at the time of eating tho remainder of the sacrifice. See 2, 27. The order of the Annyájah deities at the animal sacrifice is the following: (1) devir dvärah (the gates), 72) uşara-naktà (dawn and night), (3) devi Joştri (satiation), (4) úrj and áhuti (vigour and oblation), (5) daivya hotara (the two divine Hotars, i.e., the fire on earth and that in the sky), (6) tisro devir (the three deities : Ila, Sarasvati, and Bharati, see 2, 5), (7) barhis, (8) narasamsa (see 2, 5), (9) vanaspati, (10) barnir vâritinām (the stalks of kusa grass, thrown in water jars, (11) Agni Sviftakrit, 

2* The Upayájas, or supplementary offerings, accompany the Anupājas. At the same time that the Hotar is repeating the Anuyâja mantras, and the Adhyaryu is throwing at the end of each an oblation into the fire, the Pratiprasthâtar, who is the constant assistant of the Adhvaryu, offers eleven pieces of the guts of the slaughtered animals and accompanies his offerings with eleven Yajusmantras (see them in the Vájasaneya Samhità 0, 21, and Taittriîya Samh. 1, 3, 11). All conclude with : sváha. On comparing their text in the Vâjasaneya S., with that in the Taittiriya S., we find" some differences in the order of these mantras. The deities are the same. They are according to the Taito S. the following ones: (1) Ocean, (2) Air, (3) Savitar, (4) Day and Night, (5) Miträvaruna, (6) Soma, (7) the Sacrifice, (8) the Metres, (9) Heaven and Darth, (10) the Divine Clouds (nabras, invoked for giving rain according to Sayaņa's commentary on the Taitt. S, vol. 1. p. 550, ed. Cowell), (11) Agni Vaišvānara. The hotar has nothing to do with the Upayájas. All is performed by the Pratiprasthâtar. We find the whole ceremony minutely described in the Hirapyakesi-Srauta-Satras (4, 16, 17). The charcoals for kindling the fire for these offerings are taken from the fire which is on the place where the animal' is slaughtered. These charcoals are (as I am orally informed) pat on the so-called Dhishya, or small fire-place behind which the Hotar is sitting, and which is between the Aguidura and Marjali fires. On the same place the tail of the animal, the principal part of which belongs to the wives of gods, " is sacrificed. 

He concludes with the verse :-abhud uşå ruśatpâśur (5, 75, 9), i.e... aurora appeared with the roaring cattle. 

They ask: if be repeats three liturgies (keratus)*7 addressed to Agni, Uşâs, and the Asvins, how can his concluding (the whole liturgy) with oue verse only be accounted for? (The answer is :) all three deities are contained in this verse). (The first pada :) "aurora appeared with the roaring cattle," is appropriate to Uşâs. (The second pada :) “Agni is put in at the proper time," belongs to Agni. (The second half verse :) "O, ye mighty (brothers !), your immortal carriage is yoked, bear my sweet voice !" belongs to the Asvins. , When he thus concludes with this one verse, then all three liturgies have their place in it.

THIRD CHAPTER. (The Apo Naptriyam Ceremony. The Upåmsu and Antaryáma Oblations. 

The Hotar has no share in the Bahişpavamâna Meal. The Libation for Mitra-Varuna to be mixed with milk. On the Purodaśas belonging to the Libations. Harişpankti. Akşara-paňkti. Narâšansa-pankti. Savana-parkti). 

Story of the Südra Rişi Kavaşa?). The Rişis, when once holding & sacrificial session on (the banks of the Sarasvatî, expelled Kavasa, the (118) son of Ilûşa, from (their) Soma 

15 This term denotes the parts of the Pratar-anuraka which introduces the Soma sacrifice. 

* In the Kausitaki Brahmanam (12, 3), the story of Kavaşa is roported in the following way : माध्यमाः सरस्वत्या सत्रमासत तद्वापि कवषो मध्ये निषसाद । तं हेम उपोदुर्दास्या वै त्वं पुत्रोऽसि न अयं स्वया सह मनधिप्याम इति स ह क्रुद्धः प्रवत्सरस्वतीमेतेन सूक्तन तुष्टाव । तं हेयमन्वेयाय त उ हेमे निरागा इव मेनिरे तं हान्वावृत्योचुऋपे नमस्ते अन्तु माना हिंसीस्त्वं वै नः श्रेष्टोऽ सि यं स्वेयमन्तीति । तं यज्ञपयांचक्रस्तस्यह क्रोधं विनिन्युः । स एष कवषम्यैष महिमासूक्तस्य चानुदिता। i, e., the Rişis, called the "middle onos” (Gritsamada, Visvimitra, Vämnadeva, Atri, Bharadvája, Vasiştha, seo Âšv. Gribya Sfitras, 3, 4), hold onco a sacrificial session on the Sarasvatî. Amongst them there sat Kavaşa. These (Rişis) reproached him (that he had come among them) saying: “Thou art the son of a slave girl, wo shili neither eat nor drink with thee." Having become angry, ho ran to the Sarasvati, and obtained her fayour by means of this hymn (pra devutra braluna:re). She followed him. These Rışis then thought that he was guiltless. Turning to him, they said, "Risi! adoration be to theo, do us no harm! thou art the most excellent among us, for she (Barasvati) follows thee." They made him the manager of tho sacrifice, and thus appeasod his wrath. This is the importance of Karaşa, and he it was who made that hymn knowo. 

The occasion on which Kavaşa had this hymn revealed to him, is thus related in the Kauşítali Brâhm. (12, 11: 

sacrifice (saying): How should the son of a slave-girl, a gamester, who is no Brahman, remain among us and become initiated into all sacrificial rites)? Tbey turned him out (of the place) into a desert, saying, that he should die by thirst, and not drink the water of the Sarasvati. After having been driven (from this place), into a desert, he, being vexed by thirst, saw (the mantra called) Apó naptrîyam: pra devatrd brahmane gâtur etu, &c., i.e., may there be a way leading to the gods for the Brahman (may he be received among them). By this means he obtained the favour of the waters. They went out of their house) to (meet) him. Sarasvati surrounded him on all sides. Therefore that place is called Parisärakr. (from enam-kavaşam-parisasára). As Sarasvatî had surrounded him on all sides, the Rişis said, the gods know him; let us call him back. All consented, and called him back. After having called him back, they made Apo naptriyam, by repeating: pra devatra bralmane (10, 30); by its means they obtained the favour of the waters and of the gods. He who, having this knowledge, makes the Apo naptriyam,* obtains the favour of the waters and the gods, and conquers the highest world (the heavenly-world). 

[114] He should repeat it without stopping. (If he do so) the god of rain (Parjanya) will bless his children with incessant rain. Should he stop at regular intervals, when repeating the hymn, as usual), then the rain-god would keep away in the clouds the rain from his children. Thence it is to be repeated without stopping. If he repeats thrice the first verse of this (hymn) without stopping, in this manner the whole of the hymn) becomes repeated without stopping. S 

20. (The Ceremony of Mixing the Vasativari and Ekadhana Waters.) 

After having repeated these (first) nine verses (of the hymn, 10, 30) in the same order as they follow (ope another in the Samhita), be repeats the तह स्म पुरा यज्ञमुहो रक्षांसि तीर्थध्वपो गोपायन्ति । तदेके 5 पो ऽछ जग्मुस्तत एव तान् सर्वान जध्नुस्तु एव तत् कवषः सूक्तमपश्यत्पंचदशचे प्र देवता ब्रह्मणे गातुरेस्विति तदन्वत न यज्ञमुझे रक्षांसि तीर्थेभ्यो ऽ-पाहन् । Ol old the Raksas, the disturbers of the sacrifice, guarded the waters on the bathing places. Some persons had come to tbe waters. Thereupon the Raksas killed them all. Kavasa then saw this hymn which comprises fifteen verses: pra depatrå. He then repeated it, and by means of it turned the Rakşas from the bathing places, and killed them. 

* The priests take water from a river, putting it in an earthen vessel. This water serves for squeezing the Soma juice. 

* He has to repeat only the first verse thrice without stopping, whilst all remaining verses of the hymn may be repeated in the usual manner. For, the repetition of the first holds good for the whole remaining part. 

78 

(11th verse), hinota no adhvaram, &c, as the tenth, and (after it, he adds the 10th :) avaruritatir, when the waters' filled (in jars) by the Ekadhanins are (115) turned away (from the river or tank whence they have been taken to the sacrificial compound). When they are seen (by the Hotar), he repeats : proti yad âpô adriśram (10, 30, 13). When the waters approach (the Chât vâla), then he repeats the verse : âdhenavah payasd (5, 43). When the (Vasativari and Ekadbanâ) waters are joined together in the Chamasas of the Hotar and Maitrå varuna), then the Hotar repeats : sam anyd yanti (2, 35, 3). 

(To illustrate the origin of this rite, the following story is related. ) 

Both kinds of waters, those called Vasativari, which were brought the day previous (to the Soma feast), and those called Ekadhands, which were brought on the very morning (of the Soma feast), were once jealous of one another, as to which should first carry up the sacrifice. Bhrigu, becoming aware of their jealousy, bade them to be quiet, with the verse - sam anyâ yanti, &c. He restored peace among them. The waters of him who, having such a knowledge, restores peace among them in this manner) will carry his sacrifice. 

(116) When (both kinds of waters) the Vasativaris and the Ekadhanās are poured together in the Chamasa of the Hotar, he repeats : doo na devir Upayanti (1, 83, 2). Then the Hotar asks the Adhvaryu : 

"I gubjoin here a more detailed description of the Apó naptriyant ceremony, or the joining of the water jugs. My statements are taken from a Soma prayogą (a manual of the Adhvaryu priests), the Hiranyakeši Srauta satras, and oral infon. mation. After the Hotar has inished the Prâtar-apuvaka, the Adhvaryu addresses to him the words : Ask for (isya) the waters," to which the Botar answers : « Apa naptriya" (calling upon them). The Adhvaryu continues his orders (before the Hotar can answer) : Ohamasa-adhvaryu of the Maitråvaruna, come hither ye Ekadlanins (bringer of the Ekadhanå waters) comel Nestar bring the wife of the sacrificer)! Agnid (Agnidhra), turn the Chamasa (Soma cup) of the Hotar and the vasativari wators towards one another in the Ohåtvala (a hole, for making ablutions)! The Chamaga. adhvaryu of the Maitråvarupa then brings a Chapasa. The Ekadbanins, i.e. those who carry the so-called Ekadhana waters, then come with three jugs for the ekadhand, that the Adhvaryu should first throw one stalk (ekadhana) into tho jam, and thus consecrate it. Thence these waters are called ekadhands. The Nestar brings the wife who holds & jug in her hand. After all haro come, the Aalvaryu throws one stalk of kusa grass into the waters, and after having repoated the mantra, devir apak, ho puts four sruvafuls of ghee on the stalk, and sacrifices it. The Adhvaryu brings the Chamasa of the Hotar and that of the Maitrâraraga, in which the Pradhana waters are. into mutual contact, and puts the Vasatîrarî water jug near it. He pours water from Ht into the Chamasa of the Hotar, and leads it into that of the Maitråvaruna, and again from that of the Maiträvaruņa into that of the Hotar. When the waters poured by the Adhvaryu from this jug come near the Hotar, the latter asks the Adhvaryu thrice, adhvaryo aver apa---Hast thou brought the waters, Adhvaryu? Instead of this formula, we find in the Kau, îtaki Br. (12, 1,) sem er which means exactly the saine, 

79 

A 

Hast thou obtained the waters ? For the waters are the sacrifice. (The question therefore means :) Hast thou obtained the sacrifice? The Advharyu answers : These (waters) are completely obtained. This inéans : see these waters. 

(The Hotar now addresses to the Adhvaryu the following words :) * With these waters you will squeeze, O Adhvaryu, for Indra, the Soma, the honey-like, the rain-giving, the inevitably-successful-making? at the end, after having included so many ceremonies (from the first to the last); (you will squeeze) for him (Indra), who is joined by the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Ribhus, who has power, who has food, who is joined by Brihaspati, and by all gods; (you will squeeze the Soma) of which Indra (formerly) drank, slew his enemies, and overcame bis adversaries. Om!" (After having spoken these words) the Hotar rises from his seat (to show his respect). Respect is to be paid to the waters by rising, just as people rise to salute & distinguished [ 117 ] person who is coming near. Thence the waters are to be saluted by rising from the seat, and turning towards them. For, in the same manner, people salute a distinguished man. Therefore tbe Hotar must go behind the waters for saluting them. For, the Hotar, even if another one brings the sacrifice, has (in this way) the power of earning fame. Therefore the repeater (of the mantra) should go behind them. When going behind them, he repeats: ambayo yanty adhvabhiḥ (1, 23,16), j.e., the waters which are the friends of the sacrificers come on (various) ways mixing their own) liquid with honey. (Iu the word madhu, honey, there is an allusion to Soma.) If a man, who has not tasted (formerly) the Soma juice, should wish to earn fame (he ought to repeat this verse). If ho wishes for beauty, or for the acquirement of sacred knowledge (Brahma splendour), he should repeat the verse, amúr yâ upa súrye (1, 23, 17). If he wishes for cattle, he should repeat, apo devir upahvaye (1, 23, 18). os terminatawwwwwwwwwwwwww 

• The word aver, in the formala used by the Hotar, is here explained by * avidali," thou hast obtained. 

* In the original, Utem arannamur. The formulas appear to be very ancient. ANUN Ümur is an imperfect of the intensive of the root nam. In the Kausitaki Brühmaṇam stands the same formula 

i Tivrantam. The word, tîvra, “puugent, " is here, an doubt, used in a figurative sense, as Sây. explains it. It means a thing that is altimately to the point, that hits at its aim, just as the sting of an insect. Say's explanation is, on the whole, certainly correct. That this is the true meaning, is corroborated by the following word, baluro madhyam, i, e., which has much (i.e., many ceremonies) between the commencenent and end. Both expressions seem to belong together, forming a sort of proverbial phrase, the import of which is that, notwithstanding the mapy ceremonies, the fruit of the Sonia sacrifice is not lost, but ultimately sure. 

SO 

Should he, when repeating all these verses, go behind (the waters), he would obtain fulfilment of (all) these wishes. He who knows this, obtains these wishes. 

When the Vasatitari, and Eladhanás are being put (on the Vedi), then he repeats, imâ ayman revatir jîva dhanyâ (10, 30, 14); and with the verse, âgmann âpah (10, 30, 15), he concludes when they are (actually) put (on the Vedi). 

21. 

(The Libations from the Upâmsu and Antaryāma Grahas. 

The Haling in and out of the Air by the Hotar). The Prâtar-Anuväka is the head of the sacrifice (Soma sacrifice). 

The Upåmsu and Antaryâma [118] Grabas) are the air in haled (prána) and the air exhaled (apana®). Speech is the weapon. Therefore, the Hotar should not make his voice heard before the libations from the Upandu and Antaryáma grahas are poured (into the fire). Should the Hotar make his voice beard before these two have 

Upåmśu and Antaryama are names of vessels from which the two first Sorna libations are poured into the Alavaniya fire. as soon as the juice is obtained by squeezing. Both libations which precede those from the other Soma vessels (Aindrava yava, &c.) poured into tho fire of the Uttara Vedi, are not accompanied with mantras recited by the Botar, as all other libations aro, but thoy are performed by the Adhvaryu, whilst the Hotar is drawing in his breath, or haling out the air which was breathcd in. When doing the first, the libation from the Upânisu graha is poured into the fire ; whon doing the latter, that from the Antaryama graba is given Tho Adhyaryı rcpoats sowo sacri icial formulas (see the Taittirîya Samhiti 1, 4, 2, 3), whilst the Ilotar muttors only tho two formulas (the technical name of such formulas repeated by the IIotar is nigada) which aro mentionod here (2, 21), and also in the Asy. Sr. Satras (5,2). 

In the books belongivg to the Yajurveda, we meet the terms upáisu graha and upárnáu patra, and likewise antaryama graha, and antaryima pritr. These torms require some explanation. The patra is a vossel, resembling a large wooden jar with but a very slight cavity on the top, in which the Soma juice is filled. The grala is a small cap, like a saucer, made of earth, and put over the cavity of tho Soma vessel, in ordor to cover the "precious" juice. T'ho bottom of it is ürst put in water, and a gold leaf placed beneath it. There are as many grabas as there are påtras; they belong together just as cup and saucer, and are regarded as insoparable. The word graha is, however, talen often in the sense of the whole, ineaning both graha and půlra. On the difforent names of the grahas required at the three great libations, see the Gruhakri nda in the Batap. Brahm, 4, and the commentary on the Taittiriya Samhita (vol. i. p. 503-693 od. Corell). I am in possossion of several gralas and patras. 

At the end of the Prâtar-anuvâka, the Hotar must, aftor having ropeated with a low voice the mantra, pranam yachhu, &c., draw in tho breath as strongly as he can. Then ho repeats with a low voice, apanan yachha, &c., and, after having finished, he exhales the air (through the nose) as strougly as he can. Ile repeats with low voice, vy@nriya, &c, and when touching the stono by which the 800u for the Upaliñou graha is squeezed, he is allowed to speak aloud. (Oral information). 

81 

[119] been poured into the fire, then he would carry off the vital airs of the sacrificer by means of the speech, which is a weapon. For (if he do so) some one should say to the Hotar (afterwards)," that he has made the vital airs of the sacrificer go off, (and he, the Hotar) would lose his life.o It happens always thus. Thence the Hotar should not make his voice heard, before the libations from the Upâńsu and Antaryâma grabas are poured into the fire. He should, when the libation from the Upârgu graha is given, mutter the words:" Keep in the air inhaled ! Svâhâ ! (I emit) thee, O speech of good call for pleasing the sun (which is thy presiding deity)." He should then draw in the air, and say (with a low voice): "0 breath, who goest in (my body), keep in (my body) the breath!" He should, when the libation from the Antaryâma graha is given, mutter the words: "Keep in the air exhaled! Svâhâ ! (I emit) thee, O speech of good call for pleasing the sun." (After having spoken these words) he should hale out the air, and say, “ O air, haled out, keep this very air (which is to be haled out, in my body)." By the words“ (I emit) thee (O speech!) for the air, circulating (in my body)," he then touches?? the stone used to squeeze the Soma juice for the Upânsu graha, and makes his voice heard. This stone to squeeze the Soma juice for the Upâmáu graha is the soul. The Hotar, after having put (thus) the vital airs in bis own self, emits his - voice, and attains his full age (100 years). Likewise, does he who has such a knowledge. 

22. 

[120] (The Hotar has no share in the Bahiş-pavamana Meal. The Soma Libation for Mitra-Varuna to be mixed with Mill). 

(After the libations from the Upâmsa and Antaryâma have been poured into the fire, the Soma squeezed, and poured into the different vessels-grahasa-such as Aindavayava, &c., which are then kept in readi ness for making the libations, five of the priests : Adhvaryu, Prastotar, Pratihartar, Udgåtar, and Brahmâ, one holding the hand of the other -samanvārabdha-walk in the direction of the Chátvála, and ultimately take their seats for performing the ceremony of the Stotra, i e., chanting a sacted verse-a Säman. Now the question is, whether the Hotar is allowed to walk or not at the same time that the other priests just mentioned do so.) 

At that (occasion, when the priests walk) they (the theologians) ask, whether he (the Hotar) ought to walk or not (together with the others). 

10 That is to say, some one might charge him afterwards with baving murdered the sacrificer, 

11 Not struck against another, as is done when the Soma juice is being squeezed, 11Some say, he ought to walk; for this meall, in honour of the Bahiga pavamâna-stotra's (which is about to (121) be performed by the Sâma singers) is enjoyed equally by both gods and men ; hence (both gods and men) participate in it. But those who say so are not to be attended to. Should he walk (along with the Sâma singers), then he would make the Rik (which is repeated by the Hotar) föllow the · Såman. (If any one should see him do so) he at that occasion should tell him : "The Hotar here has been behind the Sâma singers. and ceded his fame to the Udgâtar; he has fallen from his place and will in future) also fall from it." So it always happens to the Hotar (who walks after the Sâma singers).* Therefore he ought to remain where he is sitting, and repeat the following Anumantrana 18 verse : "which Soma draught here at the sacrifice, placed on the sacred grass, on the altar, belongs to the gods, of this we also enjoy a share.” Thus the soul of the Hotar is not excluded from that Soma draught (which is drunk by the Sâma singers after the Bahiş-pavamâna Sâman is over). Then (after having repeated the mantra mentioned) he ought to repeat : “ Thou art the mouth of the sacrifice); might I become the [122] mouth (first among my people) also! For the Bahiş-pavamâna 

12 Thus I translate bruksa. It refers to the eatiug of Charu or boiled rice by the Sama aingers before they chant. The Hotars are excluded from it. 

1 This stotra consists of nine richas commencing with: upasmai gayata naran, which all are found together in the Sámavedarchikum ii. 1-9. All uine richrs are solemnly chanted by the three Sâna singers, Prastotar, Udgitar, and Pratihartar. Each of these verses is for the purpose of chanting, divided into four parts : Prastava, i.e., prelude, the first being preceded by hurn, to be sung by the Prastotar, Udgitha, the principal part of the Saman, preceded by ont, to be chanted by the Udzatar; the Pratikára, i.e., response introduced by huti, to be chanted by the Pratibartar, and the Nidhana, i.e., finale, to be sung by all three. To give the student an idea of this division, I here subjoin the second of these richas in the gama form, distinguishing its foar parts 

Prastáva: a Y Yo Odgîtha": calot saregalaret i Pratihâra : Maril Midhana: ora 11 

The Nidhanas, i e, finals, are for the nino Pavam&na-stotra verses, the following ones: ART, Ar gali, or, ale, anā g (for the four last verses). 

14 The Rik is regarded as a solid foundation on which the Saman is put. Ses the passage in the Chándogya-Upanişad (1, 0, 1), here quoted by Sayana : " The Rik is the earth, the Saman Agni; jast as (the fire is put) on the earth, the Saman is placed over the Rik (as its foundation); thence the Saman is sung placod over tho Rik." This means, before the singers can sing the Saman, the Rik which serves for this purpose, is first to be repeated in the form in which it is in Rigveda. This is generally done. See, besides, Ait. Br. 9, 23. 

" This is the repetition, with a low voice, of A verse or forinnia, by tho Hotar, attor a ceremony is over, 

83 

draughat is the very mouth of the sacrifice (sacrificial personagel." He who has such a knowledge, becomes the mouth of bis on people, the chief among his own people. 

An Asura woman, Dirghajthvi (long-tongued), licked the morning libation of the gods. It (consequently) became inebriating everywhere. The gods wished to remedy this, and said to Mitra and Varuņa : “Ye two ought to take off this the inebriating quality from the Soma)." They said: “Yes, but let us choose a boon from you." The god said : Choose! They chose at the morning libation curd of milk whey (poyasya) in milk. This is their everlasting share; that is, the boon chosen by them. What had been made by her (the Asura woman) inebriating, that was made good (again) by the curd; for both Mitra and Varuņa removed, through this curd, the inebriating quality, as it were (from the Soma juice). 18 

28. (Purodása Offerings for the Libations.) The libations (saranáni) of the gods did not hold (they were about falling down). The gods saw the rice cakes (Prirodásas). They portioned them out for each libation, that they should hold together the libationg. Thence their libations were held together. When, therefore (at the libations) rice cakes are portioned (123) out for holding together the libations, the libations offered by the sacrificers are then (really) held together. The gods made these rice cakes before (the Soma offering). Thence it is called purodaśa (from puro, before). 

About this they say : for each libation one ought to portion out rice cakes, one of eight potsherds (a ball put on eight kapålas) at the morning. one of eleven potsherds at midday, and one of twelve at the evening, liba tion. For the form of the libations is defined 17 by the metres. But this 

* The translation of this sentence offers some dificulty. I follow here Sayapa, who refers the one asyai to Dirghajihui, the other to payasya. We have here an all sion to mixing the Soma with sour milk (dadhyaśih), in order to make it less inebriating The eurds put in it, are Mitra's and Varuna's everlasting skare. By the story which is here told, the author tries to account for the fact, that the libation for Mitra-Varuga is mixed with curds of milk whey. At present, the Soma is not generally mixed with sour milk. A large quantity of water is taken, in order to weaken its strengthe 

1 That is to say, at the morning Hbation Gayatri, each pada of which consists of eight syllables, is the leading metre, whilst at the midday libation Tristubli (with four padas, each of eleven syllables), and at the evening libation Jagats (with four padas, each of twelve syllables), are the leading netres. Therefore, some sacrificial priests were of opinion that, in accordance with the number of syllables of the leading metre of each 

libation, the number of kapalas (potsherds) should be eight at the morning, eleven at tha midday, and twelve * the evening, libtaion, 

84 

u of barley (dhanah) 

purodåsa, and parasu 

(opinion) is not to be attended to For all the rice cakes, which are por tioned out for each libation, are Indra's. Thence they ought to be put (at all three libations) on eleven potsherds only. " 

About this they say: one ought to eat of such a portion of a rice cake which is not besmeared with melted butter, in order to protect the Soma draught. For Indra slew with melted butter as his thunderbolt Vritra. But this (opinion) is not to be attended to. 18 For the offering (besmeared with butter) is a liquid sprinkled into the fire), and the Soma draught is such a liquid sprinkled (into the fire). (Both-Ghee and Soma being thus of the same nature) the sacrificer (124) should eat of any part of the offering (whether besmeared with ghee or not). 

These offerings, viz., melted butter, fried grains of barley (dhåndh), karambha, a parivapa, " purodâśc, and payasya, " come by themselves to the sacrificers from every direction. To him who has such a knowledge come these offerings) by themselves. 

24. (Haviş-panktı. Akşara-parkti. Naraśarsa-pankti, 

Savana-pankti.) 

• He who knows the offering consisting of five parts prospers by means of this offering. The offering consisting of five parts (haris-pankti) comprises (the following five things): fried grains of barley, karambha, parirdpa, purodáša, and payasya. 

He who knows the Akşara-pankti sacrifice (offering of five sylla bles), prospers by means of this very sacrifice. The Akşara-paukti com prises (the following five syllables): su, mat, pad, vag, de. He, who has such a knowledge, prospers by the sacrifice consisting of five syllables. 

He who knows the Narâšamso-parkti ** sacrifice (125), prospers by 

the sacrificers from 

15 The reason is that Indra's metre, Triştubh, consists of eleven syllables. 

19 The Soma is not to be brought into contact with anything that is supposed to have been an instrument of murder, as in this case the welted butter was. 

20 This is a kind of pap, prepared of curds and barley juice (sabtu) by kneading both together. Instead of curds, slightly melted butter (sarpis) might be taken. Gee Katys yana Srauta Sûtra. 9, 1, 17, 

21 This is another kind of pap, prepared of fried grains and barley juice. 31 See 2, 22. p. 122. 

23 These five syllables are to be muttered by the Hotar when making sapa (the utter ing of mantras with a low inaudible voice), after the havis-panti is over. They, no doubt, correspond to the five parts of the huvis-pankti offering. 

34 This means : the assemblage of five Narašunsas. Narás uriisu is, as is well known, a name of Agni, and of some other gods, identical with the Nairyo-sunha of the Zend-Avesta (see Haug's * Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the Parsees,' p. 232). According to the explanation given by Sayana, who follows

means of it. For two Narâšamsa offerings belong to the morning, two to the midday, and one to the evening, libation. This is the Narâšamsa-pankti sacrifice. He who has such a knowledge prospers hy 

it. 

He who knows the Savana-pankti sacrifice, prospers by it. This Savana-pankti sacrifice consists of the animal which is sacrificed the day previous to the Soma feast (paśur upavasathe), the three libations (scvanani), and the animal to be sacrificed after the Soma feast is over (pasur anubandhyah). This is the Savana-pankti sacrifice. He who has such a knowledge prospers by means of the Savana-pankti sacrifice. 

The Yâjyâ-mantra for the havis-pankti is : *5 “May Indra, with his "two yellow horses, eat the fried grains (first part of the haviş-pankti', " with Puşan, the karambha ; may the parivapa (be enjoyed) by "Sarasvati and Bharată, and the cake (aprīpa-purodâśa) by Indra !" The two yellow horses (hari) of Indra are the Rik and Sâman. Puşan (the guardian of flocks, the divine herdsman) is cattle, and karambhd is food." As to the words : sarasvati-van and bharativan, Sarasvati is speech, [126] and Bharata (bearer) means vital air. Parirâpa is food, and opupa is sharpness of senses. 

(By repeating this Yâjyâ-mantra) the Hotar makes the sacrificer join those deities, assume the same form, and occupy the same place with them. He (the Hotar) who has such a knowledge becomes (also) joined to the best beings and obtains the highest bliss. 

The Yajyâ-mantra for the Svistaksit of the Purodaśa offering at each libation is " Agni, eat the offering.""? one of the masters (Acharyas), the word Narasansa, i.e. belonging to Narasamsa, means the Soma cups (chamasa), after one has drunk out of them, sprinkled water over them, and put them down. For, in this condition, they belong to Narâšamsa, At the morning and midday libations, the Soma cups (chamasa) are filled twice each time, and at the evening libation only once. Thus the Soma cups become during the day of libations five times Narásamsas. This is the Narásamga-pankti sacrifice. 

35 It is not in the Sanhita. As it stands here, it appears to have been taken from another Sakha. For, whilst we found above, five parts of the haviş-pankti mentioned, here in this mantra we have only four, the payasyä being omitted. 

*According to Sâyana, the meaning of the latter sentence is : Púşan is called by this name from his feeding (puş) the cattle, and karumbha is called food from being itself the nourishment. 

* The Kausitaki Brahmapam (13,3) farnishes us with a fuller report on the origin of the Sviştakrit formula required for the Purodaša offerings which accompany the Soma libations. It is as follows: 

हविरग्ने वीहीत्यनुसवनं पुरोडाश: स्विष्टकृता यजत्यवत्सारो प्राश्रवणो देवानां होतास । तमेतस्मिन् धुम्ने मृत्युः प्रत्यालिल्येमि मृत्युः स हविरग्ने बीड़ीति हविषाग्निं प्रीस्बाऽथातिमुमुचे तथो श्वैवं विद्वा होता हविरले वीहीत्येव हविषाग्निं प्रीत्वाथातिमुच्यत एतैहवा अन्तराकाशैर्देवाः स्वर्ग लोक जग्मु 

[127] By repeating this mantra, Avatsdra (an ancient Rigis obtained Agni's favour and conquered the highest world. The same happens to him who has such a knowledge, and who knowing it has this haviş-paňkti offered (i.t., the sacrificer), or repeats the Yâjyà-mantra belonging to it (i.e., the Hotar).

FOURTH CHAPTER. (The Dvidevatya Graha Lihations, i.e., the Libations poured from the Aindravayava, Maiträvaruna, and Asvina Grahas. Rituyðjas. The Silent Praise). 

25, (Story of a Race run by the Gods for obtaining the right to drink first from a Loma Libation. The Aindra váyava Graha. Explanation of a certain custom with the Bharatas). 

The gods could not agree as to who of them should first taste the Soma juice. They (all) wished for it, (each saying) "Might I drink first, might I drink first." They came (at length) to an understanding They said: “Well, let us run a race. Ho of us who will be victor, shall first taste the Soma juice." So they did. Among all those who ran the race, Vayu first arrived at the goal; next Indra ; next Mitra and Varuna, then the Aśvins. Indra thinking he would be beforehand with Vâyu, (ran as fast as he could [128]and) fell down elose to him. He

BREITET yisaka : 1 6.e., The Hotar Nses, as Yâjyå of the Sviştakrit offering of the Puroddsa which accom panies the libations, the formula : “Agni, eat the offering" 

(On the origin of this formula, the following is reported :) Avatedra, the son of Prasravapa, was (once) the Hotar of the gods. In that abode of light, Death (one of the gods) attached himself to him; for Agni is Weath. Ho pleased Agni with an oflering, repeating : "Agai, eat of the offering," and was released. 

(There is another story reported on the origin of this formula, which runs as follows :-) 

The gods went by means of their innate light and splendoor to the celestial world. In that abode of light, Death attached himself to them Agni is Death. They pleased Agai with an offering, repeating " Agni, eat the offering." and were released. 

This formula (havir ugne vihi) consists of six syllables ; the soul consists of sir parts,mis six-fold. Thus the sacrificer redeems (by means of this formula) through & soul (represented by this formula) his own soul, and clears off his debto. This is the mantra of Avatsära, the son oť Praśravanabe

then said, “We both have (arrived at the goal) together; let both of us be winners of the race." Vâyu answered, “ No! I (alone) am winner of the race.” Indra said, “ Let the third part (of the prize) be mine ; let both of us be winners of the race !" Vâyu said, “No! I alone am winner of the race." Indra said, "Let the fourth part of the prize) be mine; let us both be winners of the race !" To this Vậyu agreed, and invested him with the right to the fourth part (of the first Soma cup presented). Thence Indra is entitled only to the fourth part; but Vâyu to three parts. Thus Indra and Vậyu won the race together; next followed Mitra and Varuņa together, and then the Asving. 

According to the order in which they arrived at the goal, they obtained their shares in the Soma juice. The first portion belongs to Indra and Vayu, then follows that of Mitra and Varuņa, and (lastly) that of the Asvins. 

The Aindravdyava Soma jar (graha) is that one in which Indra enjoys the fourth part. Just this (fourth' part, as belonging to Indra) was seen by means of revelation) by a Rişi. He then repeated the mantra appropriate to it, niyutvás Indraḥ sarathir, i.e., Vâyu' (and) Indra his carriage-driver! Thence, when now-a-days the Bharatasspoil their enemies (conquered in the battle-field), those charioteers who (129) seize the booty, say, in imitation of that example set by Indra, who won his race only by becoming the charioteer (of Vâyu), “the fourth part of the booty is ours) alone." 

28. (On the Meaning of the Libations from the Aindravdyava, Maitråvaruna, and Asvina Grahas. The two Anuvákyds for the Aindravayara Graha.) 

The Soma jars (graha) which belong to two deities 5 are the vital airs. The Aindravaya va jar is speech and breath, the Maiträraruna jar is eye and mind; the Asvina jar is ear and soul. Some (sacrificial priests) use two verses in the Anuştubh metre as Puronuvâkyâs, and two in the Gâyatri metre as Yâjyâs when offering (the Soma juice) from the 

Niyutván is a frequent epithet of Vayn. See the hymn 2, 41, meaning, one who has teams, oxen, cows, &c. 

• Sayana does not take this word here as a proper dame, in which sense we gener ally find it in the ancient Samskrit Literature, but as an appellative poun, meaning 56 warriors." He derives the word from bhara cattle, and tan to extend, stretch; to which etymology no modern philologist will give his assent Satvan is here explained by Sayapa as “charioteer;" but in his commentary on Rigveda 1, 62, %, he takes it ia the sense of “enemy" which is, we think, the right one. 

• The author of the Brahmanam explains bere the reason of the custom why the charioteers are entitled to the fourth part of the booty made ip a battle. 

These vessels are called dindrariyava, Maifrâtaruna, and Asvina.

Aindravậyava jar. As the Aindravậyava jar represents speech and breath. thus the proper metres 'Anuştubh being speech, and Gayatri breath) will be applied. But this (practice) ought not to be observed. For, where the Puronuva kyâ mantra exceeds in (syllables) the Yâjyâ mantra, there is no success in the sacrifice ; but where the Yâjyâ exceeds the Puronuvâkyâ (ip syllables) there is success. 

(Likewise success is not obtained) by using the same metres (for Anuvâkyâ and Yâjyâ mantras). In order to obtain any desire what over, referring to speech and breath, the Hotar ought to do so (i e.. (130) to repeat two verses in the Anuştubh metre as Anuvâkyâs, and two in the Gayatri metre as Yájyâ mantras). In this way (all he desires) will be fulfilled. The first Puronuvâkyâ belongs to Váyu (1, 2, 1), the second to Indra and Vậyu (1, 2, 4). By that Yâjyâ ? which belongs to Vâyu, the Hotar makes (produces) breath (in the sacrificer). For Vậyu (wind) is breath, and by means of that pada (foot) of the Indra-Vâya-Yajya mantra, wbich refers to Indra, he makes speech. For speech is Indra's. He (thus) obtains every desire (granted) which refers to breath and speech, without producing any inequality (by baving the one set of mantras too long, the other too short) in the sacrifice."

(The Rite of Drinking from the Aindrarayavi, Vailraueruna, and Asvina 

Grahas by the Hotar. The Formulas repeated at those occasions.) 

The Soma offerings belonging to tivo deities are the vital airs; 3 but they are offered in the same jar for both (deities) ; for the reason is, that (all) the vital airs are of one and the same nature. They are sacrificed from two" grabas (jars with small cups), for the vital airs are a pair (such as the 

* This would be the case if the Anustubh motre should be used for the Puronuvákyà, and the Gayatri as Yajya ; for the Annstubh consists of thirty-two, and the Gayatri only of twenty-four syllables. 

The two first verses of 4, 46, are used as Yâjyas. 

* This latter remark refers to the opinion of those who maintained that the Puronuvâkyâ and Yajyâ mantras ought to be of the same motres. 

* By these, speech, eyes, and ears are meant. 

" At the soma offerings, there are always two Grahas required ; one is held by the Adhvaryı, the other by his assistant Pratipasthatar. The contents of both the grahas belong to the same pair of deities; both are therefore dvidevutyja, belonging to two derties. The author of the Brîhmana attempts here to explain the circumstance that, though the Sona offering contained in one graha belong to two deities ( Váyu and Indra, Mitra and Varuna, &c.), there are always two Gralias used, and their contenta simultanoously sacrificed.

By the (words) : “ This is a good, " this is a multitude of goods; here is good, a multitude of goods; in me is *the good (wben the Soma is drunk), a multitude of goods ; rule of speech! "protect my speecb!" the Hotar drinks Soma from the Aindravågava “graha. (Then he repeats): 'Speech with breath is called hither (by me); "may speech with breath call also me! The divine Rişis, the protectors of “(our) bodies, who are born from austerities (tapoja) are called hither (by " me)! may the divine Rişis, the protectors of our bodies, who are born " from austerities, call (also) me!' By the divine Rişis, who are the 

protectors of (our) bodies, the vital airs are to be understood. Thus he "calls (invites) the Rişis. 

(By the words): “This is a good which has knowledge; here is a good " which has knowledge ; in me is a good which has knowledge ; ruler of the eye, protect my eye!" the Hotar drinks Soma from the Maitråvaruņa graba. (Then he repeats): “The eye with the mind is called hither. May the " (182) eye with the mind call (also) me! The divine Rigis," &c. (just as above). 

(By the words): "This is a good, a good which is lasting; here is a "good, a good which is lasting; in me is a good, a good which is lasting; "ruler of the sense of hearing ! protect my sense of hearing !" the Hotar drinks Soma from the Asvina graha. (Then he repeats) : “ The sense of "hearing with the soul is called hither : may the sense of hearing with the * soul call (also) me! The divine Rişis," &c. (just as above). 

When drinking from the Aindravậyava graha, the Hotar facing the cup turns its mouth towards his face (and drinks); for the inhaled and exhaled airs are in his front. In the same manner, he drinks from the Maitråvaruņa jar; for the two eyes are in his front. When drinking from 

\# This formula resembles very much one of the most sacred prayers of the Parsis, viz. ashem vohu vahistem asti which is particularly repeated when the Zota priest (the Hotar of the Brahmans) is drinking the Homa (Soma) juice ; vont is etymologically vasu, which is very frequently used in formulas repeated by the Hotar before be tastes the sacrificial food , vahistem is the superlative of vohh, conveying the same sense as puruvasu.

(On the Repetition of the Two Yajya Mantras for Labation from the Dvidet 

yagrahas. No Anuvaşatkâra allowed. On the Agur for those Yâjyâs). 

The Soma jars belonging to two deities are the vital airs. The Hotar ought to repeat the (two) Yajya nantias (for the offering poured out of such a jar) (183) without stopping (at the end of the first mantra), in order to keep together the vital airs and to prevent their being cut off. The Soma jars belonging to two deities are the vital airs. Thence) the Hotar should not make the Anuvaşatkâra (ie, not pronounce the formula: "Agni, eat the Soma!"10 with the formula Vau șaț! after the Yâiva has been repeated). If he do so, then he stops the (circulation of the) vital airs which are not stopped in any other way). For this formula (the anuvaşatkůra) is a stop. (If one should observe a Hotar repeat the Anuvaşatkâra) one ought to tell him, that he had stopped the vital airs, which are not stopped (otherwise), and that he would consequently) lose his life. This always happens. Thence be ought not to repeat that formula (the onuvaşat!câra) when pouring oblations from the Soma jars belonging to two deities.. 

They ask, (what is the reason that) the Maiträvaruna priest gives twice his assent that the Yåjyâ mantra should be repeated, and calls twice (upon the Hotar) to do so, whilst the Ilotar declares his readiness to repeat the Yajyâ mantra only once, and (concludes with) pronouncing twice, Varşat! Vauşat' (instead of doing it once;? What is the (meaning) of the Hotar's declaration of his readiness to repeat the Yajya mantra?" (that he repeats it only (184) once at the beginning, and not before the second mantra)? 

• The Aindravayava graha bas one, the Maiträvaruna two, mouths. The drinking from the two latter ones is described as purastát pratyafichum, that is, to take the graba in one's hands, so that its mouth faces the mouth of the drinker, and, whon drinking, to turn the lower part of the vessel aside. 

The Asvina graha has three mouths. The drinking from it is described as parikáram, that is, to turn its three moaths one after the other to one's mouth when drinking, so that the whole vessel becomes turned round. (Oral information.) 

19 The recital of this formula is callod anuva setkára. 

11 The words “ assent that the Yajya mantra," &c., and "declaration of his readiness to repeat," &c., are only a translation of the term agur, stating its full import. After the Hotar has repeated the two Puronuvákyå mantras, mentioned on p. 130, he is addressed by the Maitråvaruņa priest in two formulas, following immediately one another, which are called Praisa-mantra, i.e, mantras containing an order to repeat. Both commence by 

(The answer is.) The Soma jars belonging to two deities are the vital airs. The Agur formula is the thunderbolt. If, therefore, the Hotar were to put between (the two Yâjyâ mantras) the Agur formula, he would de prive the sacrificer of his life (as if striking him) with a weapon like) the thunderbolt. (If one should observe a Hotar doing so) one ought to tell him, that for having, by means of the Agur weapon, deprived the sacrificer of his life, he himself would also lose his life. Thus it always [135] happens. (Therefore) the Hotar ought not to repeat the Agur formula in the midst of the two Yâjyâ mantras). 

And, further, the Maiträvaruņa priest is the mind of the sacrifice, and the Hotar its speech. Speech speaks only when instigated by the mind (to do so). If any one utters speech different from what he thinks, such a speech is liked only by the Asuras, but not by the Devas. The Agur formula of the Hotar is contained in the two Agur formulas (hota yakşat) pronounced at this (occasion) by the Maitrâvaruņa priest. 

29. 

(Rituyajas ) The mantras repeated for the offerings to the Ritus ** (seasons) are 

the formula: Hota yaksat, 1.e., may the Hotar repeat the Yâjyâ mantra. The Hotar being obliged to repeat both Yåjya mantras uno tenore withoutstopping, he can declare his readi ness to respond to the order given by the Maiträvaruna only before he commences to repeati the proper Vajya mantras. His readiness lie declares by the words asme. This is the águr of the Hotar. That is to be pronounced with pluti, je, with three moras, is remarked by Påņini 8, 2,88 ( 51#ara. Patañjali, in his Mahâbhâsya, explains as an elliptical expression, impiying the whole verse-- Cara FESTSTEU (Rigveda, 1, 189, 11). On the Agur formula, see Asval. Erauta Sätras 1, 5, where it is said that the Agur formula, G AS, is required at the so-called Prayájas (at the first and fifth) and principally 5, 5. In this latter passage, the rule is given to which the author of the Brahmana refers, that the two Yâjyás for the Aindravâyava graha require two Praisas, i.e, orders, one Agur, and two Vaşatkâras; whilst the two other grahas, the Maiträvaruna and the Asvina, require each only one Yâjyâ, one Praişa, and one Vaşatkâra. See also the Sânkhiyana Sutras 7,2. The formula y H is always at the beginning of the Yajya, ds well as the words ŝtat gwa at that of the Praisa mantra. The proper order to repeat is conveyed at the end of the latter by the words gads, i.e., Hotar, repeat the Yajyâ mantra, whereupon the Hotar repeats the Yajya. The repetition of this formula appears to go back to a very remote antiquity. For we find both the formula and its technical term in the Zend-Avesta. Yajámahe is completely identical with the Zend Yazanardê, which always precedes the names of Abura-mazda, the archangels, and other divine beings, and the souls of the deceased, when homage is paid to them. The technical term for repeating this formula is : a-għare (the same as d-gur). See the Fravardia Yasht 50, kahê, no idha námâ ághairyát, ie., to whose name of us will be pay homage by repeating Yazamaidë, i.e., we worship. That the word ághairyat has this meaning, is well known to the Parsi Dasturs

the vital airs. By performing [186] them, they (the priests) provide the sacrificer with vital airs. By repeating six mantras containing the singular pitund to the Ritus, they provide the sacrificer with the air inhaled (prâna); by repeating four mantras containing the plural ritubhih, they provide him with the air exhaled (apana); by repeating, at last, two mantras containing the singular pitund, they provide him with the cir culating vital air (vyâna). For the vital airs are three-fold, viz., air inhaled, air exhaled, and the air circulating in the body. (These Ritu offerings being made in three sections) in the first (series of mantras when six are given), the singular ritund is used; in the second, the plural ritubhih; and in the third, the singular again șitund are applied. (This is done) to keep together the vital airs, to prevent them from being cut off. are to be found among the so called praiņu súktas. See Asval. Sraut, 8, 5, 8. Sankhayana 7, 8, About the particulars of the Ritu Yâjâs, see Taittirîya Sanhita 1, 4, 14 and 0,5,8, with Sayapa's commentary, ed. Cowell, i., p. 043-48. The Yajri mantras and the Praisas for the Ritu offerings are essentially the same. All (12) Prairas are given by the Maiträvaruna. The first is addressed to the Hotar, and runs as follows : frar gelede 

ATT Hofa er gruBT 79T 2017 fua graus, i.e., May the Hotar repeat the Yajra mantra for Indra! May be drink Some from the cup of the lintar with the Ritu! The Yajyt contains the saine words, with the only difference that, instead of yakşat, the appropriate formula que is used. 

In the second Rituyája, which is repeated by the Potar, the Marutas are invited to deink with the Ritu from the offering of the Polar. The third belongs to Trastar and the wives of the gods. It is repeated by the Nostar ( 19 mar agreapta gregatione fawr). 

1 The fourth, which is repeated by the Agnidira, belongs to Agni. The fifth belongs to Indra-Bralini, and is repeated hy the Brahmandchiansi. The sixth is repeated for Mitra-Varuga (who are called it) by the Maitriraruņa. Thesc six mantras contain the formula ar fuam 

The seventh, eighth, ninth and tonth Rituyå jas which aro repeated byy the Hotar, Potar, Ne tar and Achhà våka respectively, belong to deva dranirodah (a name of Agni). These four mantras contain the term pati 21 faza. The eleventh and twell'th Rituyijas are repeated by the Hotar with the term nay The eleventh Lelongs to the Asrins as the two Adbvaryns; the twelfth to Agni Grihapati. 

The first Soma libation for the Ritus is poured from tho Hotrapitra, the second from the Potra-pâtra, the third from that of the Voitar, the fourth from that of tlie Agnid, the fifth from the Brahmana-patra, the sixth from that of the Prasastar (Maiträvaruna). 

The soventh, eighth and ninth from the Patras of the Hotar, Potar, and Nestar respectively. The tenth libation is not poared from one of these Patras already mentioned, but in adllition to the Påtras of the Hotar, Potar, and No tar, a "fourth vessel” (turiyam potram) is mentioned, which is called amartyam, i.e., immortal. The devo dravinodah (ogni) is called upon to prepare the Soma draught himself and repeat himself the Yasyi. The eleronth libation is ponred from the Adhvaryava-påtra, and the twelfth from the Qarhapatyy. (Sapta-Butro). 

93 

[187] The Ritu Yajás * are the vital airs. (Thence) the Hotar ought lot to repeat the Anuvaşatkâra. For the Ritus have no end ; one (always) ollows the other. Were the Hotar to repeat this formula (the anuvaşat. câra) when making the offerings to the Ritua, he would bring the endless easons (their endless succession) to a stand still. For this formula is a stand still. Who (therefore) should repeat it, would bring the Ritus to i stand still, and difficulty would be created (for the sacrifice). This Llways happens. Thence he ought not to repeat that formula, when epeating the mantras for the offerings to the Ritus. 

80. (The Hotar Bats the Puro laša and Drinks from the Grahas.). 

The Soma jars belonging to two deities, are the vital airs, and cattle is food (iļa). (Thence) after having drunk from the Soma jars belong ing to two deities, he calls Iļå (food). 1* Ifâ is cattle. He thus calls cattle, and consequently) provides the sacrificer with cattle. 

They ask, Should the Hotar first eat the food (remainder of the Purodása offering previous to the Soma offering) which he has in his hand, or should he drink's first from his Soma cup (chamasa)? (The [188] answer is) he should first eat the food which he has in his hand, then he may drink Soma from his cup. In consequence of the circums tance that he first drinks from the Soma jars (Grahas) belonging to two deities, the Soma draught is first (before he takes any other food) enjoyed by him. Therefore (after having tasted already the Soma juice by drinking from the Grahas belonging to two deities) he ought to eat the food (Purodâga) which he has in his hand, and then drink from his own cup (chamasa). In this way, be takes (for himself) nourishment of both kinds (food and drink). 

By taking both Soma draughts (from the graha and the chamosa) he obtains (for himself) nourishment (of all kinds). 

(The Flotar pours some drops of Soma from the Graha into his Chamasa ; the meaning of this proceeding is given in the following :) 

13 The same speculations on the nature of the Ritusajás, víz, that they are the vital airs, we fiod in the Kaupîtaki Brahm, 18, 9, and in the Gopatha Brähin. 8, 7. 

** The term used for "drinking " is bhakyayatt, which is also the common word for eating. That bhaks must have been used already in very ancient times for " drinking" the soma juice, is sbown in a passage in the Homa Yasht of the Zend-Avesta (see Yasna 10, 13.) yase tê bûdha haoma zairë gava iristane bakşaiti, .e., who enjoys thee, O Homa, (Soma) when being dead (by bruising and squeezing in the yellow milk. (The Homa juice of the Parsis is of yellow colour, and actually mixed with a little fresh nilk). 

** The formula for calling Ila is 'to be found in the Asvali yaua Granta Satra 1, 7: zlopáhitâ, &o. 

The Soma jars belonging to two deities are the vital airs; the Clamasa of the Hotar is the soul. By pouring drops from the Soma jars belonging to two deities in the Chamasa of the Hotar, the Hotar puts (in his own body) the vital airs for obtaining his full age. He who has such a knowledge attains to his full age (100 years). 

31. (The Origin of the Tûşînim Samsa, 1* 2.., Silent Prcise, Explained.) 

The Asuras performed at the sacrifice all that the Devas performed. The Asuras became thus of equal (139) power (with the Devas), and did not yield to them in any respect). Thereupon the Deras saw (by their mental eyes) the tûşnin samsa, i.e., silent praise. "? The Asuras (not knowing it) did not perform this (ceremony) of the Devas. This "silent praise" is the silent (latent) essence (of the mantras). Whatever weapon (vajra) the Devas raised against the Asuras, the latter got (always) aware of them. * The Devas then saw (by their mental eyes) the "silent praise" as their weapon ; they raised it, but the Asuras did not get aware of it. The Devas aimed with it a blow at the Asuras and defeated the latter, who did not perceive (the weapon which was aimed at them). Thereupon the Devas became masters of the Asuras. He who has such a knowledge becomes master of his enemy, adversary, and later. 

The Devas thinking themselves to be victors spread the sacrifice (i.e., made preparations for performing it). The Asuras came near it, intending to disturb it. When the Devas say the most daring (of the Asuras) draw near from all quarters, they said : let us finish this sacrifice, lest the Asuras slay us. So they did. They finished it by repeating the "silent praise." (The words which constitute the "silent praise" now follow.) By the words, bhur agnir jyotir jyotir agnir, they finished the Ajya and Pia-uga Šástras (the two principal liturgies at the inorning libation). By the words, indro jyotir bhuvo jyotir indreh, they finished the Nişkevalya and Marutvatîya Sastras (140] (tbe two principal liturgies at the midday libation). By the words, sitrija jyotir jyotił svak 

" See about this particular part of the Soma service, Åsval. kr. 5. 5, 9, which pass age is quoted by Sayada in his commentary on the Aitarêya Brahmanan. The three for mulas which constitute the Silent Praise (as mentioned here) form also, with the exception of the vyahritis (the three great words bhůr, bhiyult, syan) a chant called the Jyotirgánu, which is sung by the Udgâtar when holding the cloth through which tho Soma juice is strained (it is called dusa pavitra) in his hand. The metre of the three formulas (if all are taken together) is GayatriThe Rışi to whom it was revealed is said to be Puşkala (Sima prayoga). 

18 Mantras, sacred formulas and words, are always regarded as personages,

süryaḥ, they finished the Vaišvadeva and Agnimâruta Sastras (the two liturgies of the evening libation). 

Thus they finished the sacrifice by the "silent praise." Having thas finished the sacrifice by means "of the silent praise" they obtained the last mantra required for the safety of the sacrifice. 18 The sacrifice is finished when the Hotar repeats the "silent praise." 

Should any one abuse the Hotar or curse hina after having repeated the "silent praise," he should tell him (the man who abuses or curses him) that he (the abuser) would be hurt by doing so. 

(In order to make abuses or curses retort upon their author, the Hotar repeats the following mantra :) " At morning we (the Hotars) finish to-day this sacrifice after having repeated the "silent praise." Just as one receives a guest (who comes to our houses) with ceremony, in the same way we receive (the sacrifice as our guest with due honours) by repeating this (silent praise)." He who having such a knowledge should abuse or curse the Hotar after he has repeated the "silent praise," suffers injury. Thence he who has such a knowledge should not abuse or curse, after the "silent praise' has been repeated. 

32. (On the Meaning of the Silent Praise.) The "silent praise" are the eyes of the (three) libations. Bhar agnir, &c., are the two eyes of the morning libation. Indro jyotir, &c., are the two eyes [141] of the midday libation Sûryo jyotir, &c., are the two eyes of the evening libation. He who has such a knowledge, prospers by means of the three libations which are provided with eyes, and goes by means of such libations to the celestial world. 

This "silent praise " is the eye of the sacrifice (the sacrificial man). There being only one of the "great words” (bhúr, bhuvalt, svar), (in the “silent praise" of every libation), it must be repeated twice, for, though the eye is (according to its substance) only one, it is double (in its appear ance). 

The“ silent praise " is the root of the sacrifice. Should a Hotar wish to deprive any sacrificer of his standing place, then he must not at his sacrifice repeat the “silent praise;" the sacrificer then perishes along with his sacrifice (the sacrificial personage) which thus has become rootless. 

19 The sacrifice is believed to be a chain; none of its links is to be brokep. IL finished, it is rolled up. The last mantra represents the last link. Without the last link, a chain cannot be wound up. 

96 

Abont this they say: the Hotar ought to recite (it at any rate); for it is for the priest's own benefit when the Hotar repeats the "silent praise." In the priest rests the whole sacrifice, and the sacrificer in the sacrifice. Thence the "silent praise," ought to be repeated.

FIFTH CHAPTER. The Different Parts of the Ajyü Śästra : Ahara, Nivid, Sukta.) 

33. 

The call, sorsavona (called thâva) is the Brahma ; [142] the address (Nivid) is the Kşatram (royal porver), and the hymn (sukta) are the subjects (vis). By repeating (first) the call somsd vom (representing the Brahma). and then setting forth the titles (representing the royal power), the Hotar joins subsequently the Kşatram to the Brahma. By repeating the Nivid before he recites the hymu, he joins subsequently the subjects to the Kşatram, the Ksatram being the Nivid, and the hymn the subjects. 

Should the Hotar wish to deprive the sacrificer of his Kşatram, he 

1 This formula, which is very frequently used, is only a corruption and con traction of suma 1 i.e., let us both repeat the Sastre. To this call by the Flotar the Adhvaryu responds with the words : . a i, ein, we repeat, God! (deva menning here only priest). This call of the Hotar is called Ahava, and the response of the Adhvaryu PratigáraSee Åsval. Sr. S. 5, 9, where the following rules regard Ing the repetition of the Ahívo, by which the Adhvaryu is informed that the Hotai is about to repeat his recitation, are given : en TT: fra: FACE qatanyaaie eienia: SETT mararata: this Ahava (the call sonrsávom with a loud voice by the Hotar) takes place at the commencement of the Sastras at the morning libation, and at the beginning of the several parts of the Sastras (as in those of the Pra-uga sastra), and everywhere (at all fastras) within the bistra of which it forms an integral part. The first syllable ft is always pluta, i.e., spoken,with three moras, and also the one (pranav) at the end. In the Prayogas it is thus written : in prais. At the midday libation, the akáva is preceded D; the word megaf Adhvaryu (Asv. Sr. S. 5, 14), which is wanting at the morning libation At th: evening libation, there is another modification of the âhiva, viz., great tips, the syllabl so being repeated twice. Tbis áh-iva is regarded as a matter of great importance, an required at the beginning of all Såstras, be they recited by the Hotar, or the Maitråvarup or Brahmapâchhansi or the Achhavika. (See 3, 12.) 

The Nivid is an address either to a single deity or to a class of deities, inviting the to enjoy the soma libation which had been prepared for them. It generally contains ti enumeration of the titles and the qualities of the respective deities. Its proper play is only in the midday and evening libations. All the Nivids for these libations are givi in full in the Sänkhiyana Sr, S, 8, 18-23. The twelve formulas addressed to Agni wbi are enumerated in 2, 84, are properly, speaking, no Nivid, but only a Puroruk, i.e. a nie preliminary address, They are actually called so in 2, 40. We find the word also in t Zond Avesta in the verbal form : nivaédayemi i.e., I address my prayer to such and su beings (which are then mentioned). 

97 

has only to put in the midst of [143] the Nivid the hymn. By doing 30, he deprives him of his Kşatram. 

Should the Hotar vish to deprive the sacrificer of his subjects (his income, &c.) he has only to put in the midst of the hymn the Nivid. By doing so, be deprives the sacrificer of his subjects. 

But should he wish to perform the sacrifice in such a way as to keep the sacrificer in the proper possession of all he had (Brahma, Kşatra, or Vis)', then be must first repeat the ahâva (somsavom,) then the rivid, and (lastly) the silkta (lıymn). This is the proper performance for all (the three castes). 

Prajapati was in the beginning only one (not distinguished from the world). He felt a desire of creating (beings) and (thus) multiplying 

himself. Therefore) he underwent austerities, and remained silent. 

· After a year had elapsed, he uttered twelve times (words) which con stitute the Nivid of twelve sentences. After this Nivid had been pro nounced, all creatures were produced. 

(That the world had been created by means of the Nivid) this, sal (also) a Rişi (Kutsa by name) when repeating the following verse in which there is an allusion to it: sa púrvaya nivida (1, 96, 2) i.e., "he “(Agni) created through the first Nivid, through the praise of life in “songs, all the creatures of the Manus (regents of large periods of time); " through his lustre shining everywhere (he made) the heavens and "water; the gods (priests) kept Agni (back on earth), the giver of "treasures." 

This is the reason that the Hotar gets Offspring, when he puts the Nivid before the hymn (sûkta). He who has such a knowledge, is blessed 

vith children and cattle. 

34. . [144] (The Several Words of the Nivid are Explained). 

The Hotar repeats : Agnir deveddhah, i.e., Agni lighted by the gods. The Agni lighted by the gods is that Agni (in heaven); for the gods kindled him. By these words, he (the Hotar) has command over that Agni in that world (the fire in heaven). 

The Hotar repeats : Agnir manviddhah, iela, Agni lighted by men. The Agni lighted by men is this one (on earth); for men lighted him. Thus he has command over Agni who is in this world (on earth). 

* That is to say, if he does not wish to deprive one of the royal caste of his nobility, or a Vaisya of his caste. 

«The address to Agni at the Darsaparnamasa-isti, after the names of the chief patriarchs (prarara) of the sacrificer's family have been pronounced, is just like this one mentioned here, which is required at the Ajya sastra. Ašval. Sr. 8. 1, 3, 

ni 

98 

The Hotar repeats : Agnih susamit, i.e., Agni who lights well. This is Vâqu. For Vayı lights himself through himself and all that exists. Thus he has command over Vîyu in the airy region. 

He repeats : hotâ devaavritch, i.e., the Hotar chosen by the gods. The Hotar chosen by the gods is that Agni (in heaven). For he is every where chosen by the gods. Thius lie has command over him in that world (heaven). 

He repeats: hotâ manuurital, i.e., the Hotar chosen by men. The Hotar chosen by men is this Agni (on earth). For this Agni is every where chosen by men. Thus the Hotar has command over Agni in this world. 

o repeats: pranir yajñündm, i.e., the carrier of sacrifices. Vậyu is the carrier of sacrifices. For, when he blows (prâniti), then the sacrifice exists, and consequently the Agnihotram. Thus he has command over Vayu in the airy region. 

He repeats : rathir adhvarânâm, ie, proprietor of the carriage [ 145 1 laden with offerings. The proprietor of the carriage laden with offerings is that one (Agni in heaven, Aditya). For he moves to his place to which he wishes to go), just as one who has a carriage. Thus the Hotar has command over him (Agni) in this world. 

He repeats ; atúrto hotd, i.e., the Hotar who is not to be overcome. This Agni (the Agni on earth) is the Hotar who is not to be overcome. None can come across his way. Thus the Hotar has command over Agni in this world (on earth). 

He repeats : tûrnir havyâvat, i.e., the runner who carries the offerings. Váyu is the runner who carries the offerings. For Vậyu runs in an instant through the whole universe ; he carries the offerings to the gods. Thus he has command over Vayu in the airy region. 

He repeats: â devo devấn vakşat, i.e., may the god bring bither the gods. That god (Agni in heaven) is it who brings hither the gods. 

Thus he has command over that (Agni) in that world. 

He repeats: yakşad agnir devo devân, i.e., may Agni, the god, repeat the sacrificial mantras addressed to the gods. This Agni is it who repeats the sacrificial mantras addressed to the gods. Thus he has, command over Agni in this world. 

He repeats : so adhvard karati, jätavedan, i.e. may Jatavedâs (Agai) prepare the sacred food. Vậyu is Jâtavedâs. Väyu makes the whole universe. Thus he has command over Vậyu in the airy region, 

35. 

(On the Recitation of the Silkta of the Ajya sastra. The Peculiar 

Recitation of the First Verse Represents Copulation.) (When the Hotar repeats) the (seven) Anustubh verses: pra vo devâya agnaye (3, 13), he separates [146] the first pada (from the second one). For a female divaricates her thighs (at the time of coitus.) He joins the two last padas (when repeating the hymn). For a male contracts his thighs (at the time of coitus), This (represents) copulation. Thus he performs the act of copulation (in a mystical way) at the very beginning of the recitation (of the Ajya Sastra), in order to produce (offspring and cattle for the sacrificer). He who has such a knowledge, is blessed with the production of offspring and cattle. 

By separating, the tivo first padas when repeating (this hymn), he thus makes the hindpart of the weapon (represented by the Ajya Sastra) very thick, and by joining the tivo latter padas (of the hymn), he makes its forepart thin. The same is the case with an iron club or with an axe (that is to say, the forepart, the shaft is thin, and the iron) part of them thick). Thus he strikes a blow with the weapon at his enemy and adversary. Whatever (enemy) of his is to be put down, this weapon will accomplish it. 

38. (Why the Hotri Priests Repair to the Dhişuyas or Fire Places, stretching a 

Straight Line fron the Agnidhra Hearth. On the Name of the 4jya Sastra. The Sastra of the Achhôváka belongs to Indra Agri). 

The Devas and the Asuras were fighting in these worlds. The Devas had made the Sadas (sitting place) of the priests (on the right side of the Uttarâ Vedi) their residence. But the Asuras turned them out of it. They then repaired to the Agnidhra5 hearth (on the left of the Uttara Vedi). Thence they were [147] not conquered by the Asuras. Therefore, the priests take their seats near the Agnidbra, and not in the Sadas. For, when sitting near the Agnidhra, they are held (from dhri to hold). Thence that hearth is called Agnidhra. 

The Asuras extinguished the fires of the sitting place of the Devas. But the Devas took the fires (which they required) for their sitting places from the Agnidhra. By means of them they defeated 

The legend is here related, in order to account for the fact, that the priests when performing the Sastras, havo their usual sitting place near the Márjáliya fire and tako their seats (dhişnya) near the Agnidhra fire. 

Tho places to which the Brahmagam alludes are the so-called Dhiar yas, extending in a straight line from the Márjali to the Agaidhra fire. They are eight in number, all 

the Asuras and Rakşas, and drove them out. Thence the sacrificers, by taking out the different fires (required) from the Agnidhra, defeat the Asuras and Rakşasas and turn them out. 

They conquered (ajayanta) by means of the (four) Ajya Sastras at the morning libation and entered (the place) which they had conquered. Thence the name ajya (from ji to conquer, and a-yâ to come near, enter). 

Among the bodies of the minor Hotri priests (Maitrâvaruna, Brålımanâchhansi, and Achhân vâka), that of the Achhâvâka was missing when they conquered and entered (the place); for in his body Agni and Indra had taken up their abode. Agni and Indra are of all the gods the strongest, mightiest, defeating best (the enemies), the most excellent, saving best (their friends). Thence the Sastra of the Achha Vâka' at the morning libation belongs to (148) Iudra and Agni (whilst in those of the other Hotựi priests, Agni alone is praised). For Indra and Agni took their abode in his the Achhà vâka's) body.. Thence the other Hotri priests walk first to their sitting places, and last comes the Achhâváka. For he who is behind, is missing; he will join (the others) at a later time. " 

Thence the sacrificer should have a very strong Bahvricha * Brahmaņa to repeat the Achhâvâ ka Sastra, for only then (if he be strong) his (the priest's) body will not be missing. 

87. (On the Meaning of the Ajya ancı Prob-ulga Sastras. How they correspond 

with their respective Stotras. On the Yajyå of the Hotar.) 

The sacrifice is the carriage of the gods. The Ajya and Pra-uga Sastras are the two reins between the carriage and the horses). By repeating the Ajya Sastra after the Pavamânah Stotra (has been sung by the Sâma singers), and the Pra-uga after the Ajya Stotra, occupied by the so-called Hotri priests in the following order, commencing from the Märjali fire : Maiträvaruna, Hotar, Brahmanachbânsi, Potar, Nostar, Achhavaka, and Agnid. Before each of these priests there is a small earthen ring, in which sapd, dust, &C., are thrown and a little fire lighted on it for the protection of the Hotri priest who stands near it. See Mahidhara's commentary on the Vajasaneya Sanhita, p. 151-52, cd. Weber, and the Katîyâ Sutras 8, 6, 16-23, (p. 708-10, ed. Weber). 

* The Sastra of the Achhavaka consists of a bywa addresscd to Indräguis viz. indrúgni â gatam (3, 12). 

This means a Rigvedi, i.C., a repeator of the mantras, of which tho Rigveda barn hitd is made up. 

Each bastram or recitation of one of the Hotri priests pre-supposes a Stotrawi, or performance of the Sâna singers. There are always as many castras as there are Stotras. 

101 

the Hotar holds asunder the reins of the carriage of the gods, in order to prevent it from being broken to pieces. In imitation thereof charioteers hold asunder the reins of human carriages. Neither the divine nor the human carriage of him who has such a knowledge will be broken. 

They (the theologians) ask : How does the Ajya Sastra of the Hotar which belongs to Agni, correspond with the Pavamânya verses (for the fermentation of the Soma juice) which are chanted by the Sâma singers, (the rule being) that the Sastra (149) should be just like the Stotra ?! 0 (The answer is :) Agni is par mânah, i.e., purifying, as even a Rişi (already) said: Agnir rişiḥ pavamanah (9, 66, 20). The Ajya Sastra, which begins with verses addressed to Agni, thus corresponds with the Pavamânya verses of the Stotra (for Agni is also pavamânah). 

They ask: Why is the Stotram of the Sama singers in the Gayatri, and the Ajya Sastra of the Hotar in the Anuştubh metre, (the rule being) that the Stotram must be like the Sastram (i.e, both must be of the same metre)? He ought to answer : one ought to look only to the total. There are seven verses (i.e., the hymn of the Ajya Sastra) in the Anuştubh metre; by repeating the first and last verses thrice, the number is brought to eleven; as the twelfth verse, the Yajyâ, in the Virâț metre is to be counted, for the metres are not changed by an excess of one or two syllables. 1? These twelve (Anustubhs) are equal to sixteen Gayatris. The Sastra being in the Anuştubh metre, cor responds with the Gayatris of the Stotram (the metres thus being equalized). 

The Yajya mantra (belonging to the Ajya Sastra of the Hotar) is, agna indraschu dâśuşo (3, 25, 4.) (Instead of the regular order indragni, there is agna indrascha in the Yâjyâ, Agni thus being first; but this must be so, for) these two (deities) did not conquer, as Indragnt, but they conquered, when being made, Agnendrâu. The reason that the Hotar repeats a Yâjyâ verse addressed to Agni-Indra is that he might be victorious. This verse is in the Virat metre, which consists of thirty three syllables. [150] There are thirty-three gods, viz, : eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, one Prajapati, and one Vaşatkâra. Thus he makes the deities participate in the syllables at the very first recita tion (the Ajya Sastra being the first among the twelve recitations of 

70 There appearod to be an exception to tho rule in the fact that the sastra and the Stotra have not the same deity, the Grst being addressed to Agui, and the latter to Indra, whilst, according to the ralo, both Sastra and Stotra ought to rotor to one and the same deity. 

11 The Anuştubh has thirty-two syllables, but the Virat thirty-thrce.the Soma-day). According to the order of the (thirty-three) syllables, the gods severally (one after the other) drink (the Soma). Thus the deities are satisfied by the vessel holding the gods." 

They ask, Wby is the Yâjyâ verse addressed to Agni-Indra, whilst the Ajya Sastra of the Hotar belongs to Agni alone, (tbe rule being that the Yâjyâ verse is to correspond with the Sastra (to which it be longs)? The answer is) The Agni-Indra-Yâjyâ is the same with the Indra-Agni one; and this Sastra belongs to Indra-Agni, as may be seen from the (Aindrâgna) Ciraha (mantra), and the "silent praise" (used at this occasion). For the Adhvaryu takes the Graha under the recital of the following mantra : indrågni agatam sutam?' (3, 12, 1. Vâjasaneya Samhita 7, 31), i.e., “Come ye, Indra and Agni! to the Soma juice, (which is like a) fine cloud. Drink of it, driven by your mind." The "silent praise " is, thúr agnir jyotir jyotir agnir, indro jyotir bhuvo jyotir indrah; sûryo jyotir jyotili sualı suryah. Thus the Yâjyâ verse is in accordance with the Sastram. 

38. T'he Japu which is Repeated before the Libations from the Dvidcvatya 

Grahas are given. Ils Several Sentences Explained.) 

The Japa"* which the Hotar mutters, is the seed. (151) The effusion of seed is inaudible ; so is the Japa. It is, as it were, the effusion of the seed. 

1 This mystical devapátra, i.e., vessel holding the gods, is hero tho Yajyå verse in the Virag mctre. 

* This is the Yájyâ mantra which is ropeated by the Achhaváka. 

14 This Japu or inaudiblo utlcrance of words is tho vory coinmenicomont of tho Ajya bastra. It is given in full, Ašval. Nr. S. 5, 3. First tho Adhvaryu is called upon by the Hotar to turn away his face witli the words : que fazat, 1.2., Away, Adlvarya! Thon he commences the Japa with the words : su-mat, &e, (sec 2, 24). Wc hero give tho wholo of it: 

सुमत्पद्वग्दे पिता मातरिश्वा छिद्रा पदा धादछिन्द्रोक्था कवयः शंसन्सोमो विश्वचिनीयानि नेषबृहस्पतिरुस्था मदानि शंसिषद्वागायुविश्वायुविश्वमायुः क इदं शंसिष्यति स इदं शंसिष्यति. i.eu, “ May the father Måtarisvan (wind, broath) make the verso foet without a broach! May the Kavis repeat tho recitations without a breach! May Soma, tho all-possossing, guide our performances! May Brihaspati ropeat tho recitations (and) the joyful choruses! Vách (specch) is life, sho has the wholo life. She is life. Who will repeat this (Sastra)? Ho (i.lv, I, thc Hotar, roprosenting Vách) will ropoat it." From tho contents of this Japa, it is evident that tho Hotar invokes the deities prosiding over breath, spcoch, and literary skill, for a successful recitation of the wholo tastra, to accomplisk which is regarded as an arduous task. In one of tho sentencos of this Japu the repeaters are called kavis, which appears to have boen the moro ancient name of the Hotři priests. It is montioned as signifying a class of priests in tho Zend-Avesta also, 

103 

He mutters the Japa before the call śornsávom. For all that is l'epeated after the call, sorsavom, forms part of the Sastra. The Hotar addresses this call (sorsávom) to the Adhvaryu, when the latter with his face turned away is lyiog prostrate on the earth (using the two hands as his two forelegs like beasts). For four-footed beings (animals) emit their sperms at the time of copulation) having turned their faces away from one another. He (the Adhvaryu) then stands upright on his tivo legs. For two-footed beings (men) emit their sperms when facing one another in a straight line. 

(The several sentences of the Japa are not explained). 

He mutters, pita matariśve. The breath is pitâ (father), and the breath is mâtariśva ; the breath is seed. 

[152] By repeating these words, he (the Hotar) emits the seed (for a spiritual birth). 

Achhidrá padâ dha.'' Achhidrá, i.e., Fithout breach, is seert. Thence a being which is unbroken (a whole) rises out of the seed. . 

· Achhidrá uktha kavayah samsann. Those who have learnt by heart (the mantras) are called kavis. The sentence means: “They produced this unbroken (matter), i.e., the seed." 

Somo visvavid--samśîşat. Brihaspati is Brahma; the Soma, mlio is praised by the singers, is the Kşatram. The nithâni and uktha madani are the Sastras. By repeating this sentence, the Hotar recites his Sastras, instigated (prasuta) by the divine Brahma and by the divine Kşatra. Both these (Brihaspati and Soma) preside over the whole creation, whatever exists. For all that the Hotar is doing without being incited by these two (deities), is not done. (Just as) they reproach one (in common life, when something is done without order, saying) he has done what was not done (not to be done). Of him who has such a knowledge all that is done will be done, and nothing that is done be undone. 

Våg-ayur. Ayuh (life) is breath ; seed is breath ; the womb is vách. By repeating this sentence, he pours the seed into the womb. 

Kaidam-samsisyati. Kıh (who?) is Prajâpati. The meaning of the sentence is, Prajapati will generate. 

39. (On the Meaning of the Six Members of the "Silent Praise," and the Twelve Members of the Puroruk. Why Jâtavedas is mentioned in the Purorum. The Meaning of the Ajya-slikta.) 

Having called sonsâvom, he recites the "silent praise." This trans

forms the seed (represented by [158] the Japa). First the effusion of the seed takes place; then follows its transformation. 

He repeats the "silent praise" vithout proper articulation of the voice 18 (in order to make its proper words unintelligible even to those who stand nearest). For, in the same way, the seeds are transformed (going across one another). 

He repeats the “ silent praise " in six padas? (i.e., stopping six times). For man is six-fold, having six limbs. - Thus he produces by transformation the soul as six-fold, consisting of six parts. 

After having repeated the "silent praise," he repeats the Purorud (Nivid 2, 34). Thus he brings forth (as a birth) the seed which had been transformed. The transformation (of the seed) occurs first ; then follows birth. 

He repeats the Puroruk with a loud voice. Thus lie brings him (the mystical body of the sacrificer) forth with a loud voice (crying). 

He repeats it in twelve padas. The year has twelve months; Praja pati is the year; he is the producer of the whole universe. He who is the producer of the whole universe, produces also him (the sacrificer) and (provides him) with offspring and cattle for propagation. He who has such a knowledge, prospers in offspring and cattle. 

He repeats a Puroruk addressed to Jatavedasl8 (Agni), the word Jâta vedâs occurring in the last (twelfth part (of it). 

[154] They ask, Why do they repeat at the morning libation a Puroruk addressed to Jâtavedâs, whereas this deity has its proper place at the evening libation ? (The answer is) Jâtavedâs is life. For he knows (veda) all that are born. As many as he knows of are born (jâtâ nám), so many (only) exist." How could those exist of whom he does not know (that they are born ?) Whosoever. (That sacrificer) knows that he himself is made a new man (by means of the Ajya Sastra), he has a good knowledge. 

40. He repeats the (hymn), pra 20 decâya Agnaye (3, 13).2 * (The word) pra means prana (life). For all these beings move only after having been 

10 This is called ; tira iva, i.e., across as it were. 

" Its six parts are as follows: (1) f ifas (2) sarfacrat (3) Falsafavar (4) sülfatusit (5) separat (6) safa: Fif, See Åsval. ér, S. 5, 8. Properly speaking, the "silent praise" consists only of three padas. See Ait. Br.2, 31. 

1: This refers to the last pada of the Puroruk or Nivid, where Agni is mentioned liy the name of Jätavedas, See %, 34. 

1* This is an explanation of the name " Jätavedas." ** This is the Ajya-sûkta, the chief part of the Ajya-sastra. 

105 

endowed with präna. Thus the Hotar produces the prána (for the sacri ficer), and makes it ready (for use). 

He repeats, didivârsam apûrvyam (3, 13, 5).*1 For the mind has become shining (didaya), and nothing exists anterior (apúrvyam) to the mind. Thus he produces the mind (of the sacrificer), and makes it (ready for use). 

He repeats, sa naḥ sarmâni vitaye (4). Vach is sarma (refuge). For they say about one who is repeating with his speech (the words of another). “I have stopped his talkativeness (šarmavat).'** By (155) repeating this ysrse, the Hotar produces speech (in the sacrificer), and makes it ready (for use). 

"He repeats, uta no brahman (6). Brahma is the sense of hearing. For, by means of the ear, one hears the Brahma ; " Brahma is placed in the ear. By repeating this verse, be produces (in the sacrificer) the sense of hearing, and makes it ready (for use). 

He repeats, sa yantâ vipra (3). The air exhaled is Yantâ, i.e., restrainer. For the air inhaled (prâna) is held back by the air exhaled (apána), and does (consequently) not turn away. By repeating this verse, he produces the apána (in the sacrificer), and makes it ready, (for use 

He repeats, rita vd yasya rodasi (2). Rita, i.e., true is the eye. For if two men have a dispute with one another (about anything), they believe him who says, "I have seen it by the exertion of (my own) eyes." By repeating this verse, he produces the eye (in the sacrifice), and makes it ready (for use). 

With the verse, rri no rasva (7), he concludes. The whole (man) **endowed with thousand-fold gifts, with offspring, and thriving well," ** is the dima (soul). By repeating this verse, he thus produces the soul as the aggregate man, and makes it ready (for use). 

He repeats a Yâjyâ mantra. The Yajya is a gift, meritorious, and 

21Though in the Sikta the fifth verse, it is the second, if this layın is used as the principal part of the Ajya Sastra. 

32 The words, cremain are no doubt an idiomatical phrase of the ancient Sanskrit, the exact meaning of which it is now impossible to determine. Såyana ex piains it in the following way: Warrette fagara Fala na premiat ens are 

a feren erite gran fhf The irregular forms instead of *he takes a Vedic anomaly. The phrase, he further adds, is applied in common life when one's speech is stopped. The author of the Brahmapa adduces this phrase only in illustration of the supposed identity of Vâch with Sarina, 

- 23 say. takes it in the sense of Veda, which appears to be the fight interpretation, if the word is restricted to the Mantras,

fortune. By repeating it, he makes him (the sacrificer) a pure (goddess) of fortune ** and prepares her for assisting him. 

He who has such a knowledge, merges in the deities, after having been identified with the metres, [156] the deites, the Brahma, and immortality. He who thus knows how to become identified with metres, &c., has (certainly) a good knowledge ; it is beyond the soul and beyond any deity (i, e., this knowledge is of higher value than the soul, or any 

god). 

41. (The Meaning of the Several Verses of the Ajya Sukta.) He repeats the "silent praise" in six padas. There are six seasons. By doing so, he makes the seasons and enters them. 

He repeats the Puroruk in twelve padas. There are twelve months. By doing so, he makes the months and enters them. 

He repeats, pra vo devaya ** (3, 13). Pra is the air. For all beings go after air. By repeating this verse, he makes the air and enters it, 

He repeats, didivänsan. The sun is didaya, nothing is earliers, than the sun. By repeating this verse, he makes the sun and enters it. 

He repeats, na naḥ sarmâni vitaye. Sarmâni (places of refuge) means Agni. He, gives nourishment. By repeating this verso, he makes Agni and enters Agni. 

He repeats, uta no brahman. The moon is Brahma.. By repeating this verse, he makes the moon and enters her. 

He repeats, sa yanta. Vâyu is yanta (the restrainer) ; for by Vayu (wind) the universe is kept up, who prevents the air from gathering in the atmosphere only. By repeating this verse, le makes Vayu and enters bin, 

[157] He repeats, ritava yasya rodasi. Heaven and earth are the two rodas. Thus he makes heaven and earth and enters them. 

He concludes with the verse, nu no rasva. The year is a whole with thousand-fold gifts, produces, and well-being. Thus he makes the year as a whole and enters it. 

He repeats a Yâjyå nuantra. The Yajya is rain (and rain is) light ning. For lightning (produces) rain, and rain gives food. Thus he makes lightning and enters it. He who has such a knowledge, becomes identified with (all) these things " and with the deities.

THIRD BOOK, 

### 01
FIRST CHAPTER. [158 ) (The Pra-uga Sastra. Pagatkâra, The Nivids.) 

(The Pra-uga Śastra.) ! 

(The deities of the Pra-uga Śastra.) The Pra-uga Sastra is the recitation appropriate to the Soma offer 1 The Pra-aga sastra is the most peculiar of all the recitations by the Hotar on the day of the Soma feast; for it comprises a larger number of deities, divided into regular sections, than any other one, and has neither a proper Nivid, nor Pragathas, nor Dhâyyâs, nor Soktas, as we constantly ind at the Sastras of the midday and evening libations. It consists only of the verses in seven sections, mentioned in the Rigveda Sambitá (1,2-3). Each section is preceded by a so-called Paroruk, along with the Ah&va. Before the Puroruk of the first section there are, besides, the Himkára and the three great words required. I here write these introductory words in the same order in which they are repeated by the Hotri-priests up to the present day: f yzia: Free sta preiz NETETT AS : AT THEET 4** Ifrat Farf: Ferarata a t (see 1, 2,1-3) i.e. May Vâyu who walks frst, be the enjoyer of the sacrificer, come with his mind to the sacrifice; (may he come) the happy with his happy crowd! Om! Come, 0 Vayı, &o. 

The Paroruk of the second triplet (1. 2, 4-8), which is addressed to Indrayâya, is : 

गोसावा ३ हिरण्यवतं नी नरा देवा पती अमिष्टये । बाथु श्चंद्रश्च सुमखोइ मिंद्रवायू इमे मुता. i. e., the two divine men who come of golden paths, the two masters (who are) for protes tion, Indra and Vaya, the happy ones, &c. 

Puroruk of the third triplet, which is addressed to Mitra-Varuna (1, 2, 7-9): 

STT UT ETT Bar Pere PTT I POSTCAT 467073 Find the two Kavyas (descendants of the Kavis), the two kings (who are distinguished) through skilful perform ance (of sacrifices) at home, and who destroy the enemies in the combat. 

Puroruk of the fourth triplet, which is addressed to the Asyin, (1, 3, 1-3): . 

शो३० देण्या अध्वयं प्रागतं रथेन सुषत्वचा । मध्वा यज्ञ समंजाधो३ माश्विना यज्वरी० Ye two divine Adhvaryus whose skin is sun-like, come up with (your) carriage ; may ye anoint the sacrifice with honey! 

Puroruk before the fifth triplet, which is addressed to Indra (1, 3, 4-6): 

शो३० इंद्र उपधेमिमंदिष्टो वाजानां च वाजपतिः।हरियां सुतामा सखोमिन्द्रायाहि. Indra who is most stimulated (to action) through the recitations (of the Motris), and is the lord of booty, he, with his two yellow horses, the friend of the Soma drops. 

Puroruk before the sixth triplet, which is addressed to the viáve Daya) (1, 3, 7-9): 

शॉ.विश्वान्देवान्हवामहेऽस्मिन्धज्ञ सुपेशसः। त इमं यज्ञमागमन् देवासो देख्या धिया । y qua To TRF ara: fasa at eratante #TATT. We call all the gods the well-adorned to this sacrifice; may these gods come to this sacrifice with divide thought, favourably accepting the seat (prepared for them) at the preparation (by cooking) of the self-making sacrifice (i.e., of the sacrificial personage whose body is always restorect by itself, when the sacrificial rites are performed) ; (may) all (come) to drink the soma i

ings from the Grahas. Ninesuch Grahas are taken at the morning With nine (159] verses forming the Bahis-pavamâna chant, they are praised by singers. After the singers have finished [160] their chant, the Adhvaryu takes the tenth Graha (for the Asvips); the sound "him uttered by singers when chanting the other verses, counts as the tenth part. Thus, an equality of the Grahas and verses of the chant is obtained. 

The Hotar repeats a triplet addressed to Vâyu (1, 2, 1-3). By this the Vayu graha is celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to Indra Vậyu (1, 2, 4-6). By this the Indra-Vâyii graha is celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to Mitra, Varuņa. By this the Mitra-Varuņa graha is celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to the Asvins (1, 3, 1-3). By this the Asvin graha is celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to Indra (1, 3, 4-6). By this the Sukra and Manthi grahas are celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to the Vifve Devâh (1, 3, 7-9). By this the Agrayana graha is celebrated. He repeats a triplet addressed to Sarasvati (1, 3, 10-12), though there is no Sarasvati graha (no such vessel as in the other cases). Sarasvatî is Speech. Whatever grahas are taken by means of Speech (under recital of a mantra), all these are celebrated by means of Sastras. He who has such a knowledge gets (thus) cele brated (all his Grahas). 

(On the Meaning of the Several Parts of the Pra-uga Śastra.) 

By means of the Pra-uga Sastra one ob tains food. In (each part of) the Pra-uga Sastra, there is always another deity praised, and (thus) always another being celebrated. He who has such a knowledge (161), keeps different kinds of food in his Grahas. The Pra-uga Sastra is, as it were, most intimately connected with the sacrificer. Thence they say, the greatest attention is to be paid to it by the sacrificer, For by means of it the Hotar makes him (his new body) ready. 

Puroruk before the seventh triplet, which is addressed to Sarasvati (1, 3, 10-12) : 

uz artar dat a l -45 Etat net alatigar I (invoke) the goddess of Speech with my excellent speech at this sacrifice ; we invoke Sarasvati, &c. (Sapta hãntra). - 

2 The nine Grahas here alluded to are the Upansu, Antary&ma, Vàyava, Aindravayava, Maiträvaruna, Ašvina, Sukra, Manthis Agrayana. The libations from these nino Grahas belong to the Bahispavamina Stotra, and the Pra-uga sastra. 

3 See page 120. 

* The expression in the original is, 80 sa sammi, no doubt an idiomatical expression, implying "this and that is the same." 

* The whole Pra-uga is intended for providing the sacrificer with food. A variety in food is produced by changing the deities in every part of the Sastra. 

109 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Våyu, because they say, life is Vayu, Beed is life. Seed is first produced in the body) before a man is produced (out of it). By repeating a triplet addressed to Vâyu, the Hotar makes the prâna (air inhaled) of the sacrificer. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Indra and Vâyu. Where there is prâna (air inhaled), there is apana (air exhaled). By repeating a triplet, addressed to Indra and Vậyu, he thus makes the prâna and apána of the sacrificer. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Mitra-Varuņa. That is done, because they say, the eye is first produced when a human being is being called into existence. By repeating a triplet, addressed to Mitra-Varuna, he thus makes eyes to the sacrificer. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to the Asvins. Because parents say, in their conversations about a child when it is born, “it has the desire of listening (to us); it is very attentive." By repeating a triplet, addressed to the Asvins, he makes to the sacrificer the sense of hearing. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Indra. Because parents say, in their conversations about a child, when it is born, “it endeavours to raise its neck, then its head." By repeating a triplet, addressed to Indra, he makes to the sacrificer, strength. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Viśve Devâh. Because a child when it is born, uses bands and feet (162) after (it has been able to use the eye, ear, and to raise its neck). The limbs (for they are many) belong to the Visve Devâb, i.e., All Gods. By repeating a triplet, addressed to the Visve Devâh, he thus makes the limbs to the sacrificer. 

He repeats a triplet, addressed to Sarasvati. Because Speech enters the child, when it is born, last. Sarasvati is speech. By repeating a triplet, addressed to Sarasvati, he thus makes speech to the sacrificer. 

The Hotar who has such a knowledge, as well as the sacrificer for whom the Hotri priests repeat the recitations (Sastras), are, though already born (from their mother), born again from all these deities, from all the recitations (Sastras), from all the metres, from all the triplets of the Pra-uga Sastra, from all the three) libations. 

8. (The Hotar has it in his power to deprive the sacrificer of his life, &c., by not 

repeating the several parts of the Pra-uga Sastra in the proper way.) 

This Pra-uga Sastra represents the vital airs. The Hotar addresses this recitation to seven deities. For there are seven vital airs in the head. By doing so, the Hotar places the vital airs in the head of the sacrificer), 

110 

There is the question asked, Whether the Hotar might be able to produce woe as well as happiness to the sacrificer? (The answer is) He who might be the Hotar of the sacrificer at that time when the Pra-aga Sastra is to be repeated) can do with him what he pleases. If he think, “I will separate him from his vital airs," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to Väyu confusedly, or forego a pada, by which means the (several parts of the) triplet become con (183) fused. In this manner, he separates him (the sacrificer) whom he wishes 80 to separate, from his vital airs. 

Should he think, “I will separate him from his prána and apâne," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to Indra-Vâyu confusedly. or forego a pada. In this way, the triplet becomes confused, and he thus separates the sacrificer, whom he wishes so to separate, from his prâna and apâna. 

Should he think, “I will separate the sacrificer from his eye," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to Mitra-Varuņa confusedly, or forego a pada. In this way the triplet becomes confused, and be thus separates the sacrificer, whom he wishes so to separate, from his eye. 

Should be think, "1 will separate him from the sense of hearing," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to the Abvins confusedly, or forego a pada. In this way, the triplet becomes confused, and he separates the sacrificer, whom he wishes so to separate, from the sense of hearing, 

Should he think, “I will separate him from his strength," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to Indra confusedly, or forego a pada. In this way, the triplet becomes confused, and he separates him, whom he wishes so to separate, from his strength. 

Should he think, “I will separate him from his limbs," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to the Višve Devâh confusedly, or forego a pada. In this way, the triplet becomes confused, and he separates the sacrificer, whom he wishes so to separate, from his limbs. 

Should he think, "I will separate him from his speech," he need only repeat the triplet addressed to Sarasvati confusedly, or forego a pada. In this way, the triplet becomes confused, and he separates the (184) sacrificer, whom he wishes so to separate, from his speech, . 

Should he think, "I will keep him joined with all his limbs and his soul," he ought to repeat the triplet, as it was first told (to him by his master) in the right way. Thus he keeps him joined with all his limbs and his whole soul. He who has such a knowledge remaing joined with all his limbs and the whole soul,

(All the Deities of the Pra-uga Sastra are said to be forms of Agni.) 

They ask, How can it be accounted for) that the verses addressed to Agni which the Sáma singers chants are celebrated by a recitation of the Hotar commencing with a verse addressed to Vâğu, (the rule being) that the Sastra exactly corresponds to the Stotra? (The answer is) Those deities are only the bodies of Agni. When Agni is blazing up, as it were, that is his Vayu (wind) form. Thus he celebrates by means of this (Vậyu form) that (Agni form). 

Divided into two halves, the fire burns. Indra and Vậyu are two. That is his Indra-Váyu form. Thus he celebrates by means of this (Indra-Vayu form) that (Agni form). 

It moves up and down (when being lighted or extinguished); this is bis Mitra-Varuņa form. Thus be celebrates by means of this (Mitra Varuņa form) that (Agni form). (165] The dangerous touch of Agui is his Varuna form. His Mitra form is (shown in the fact) that men who make friends with him may sit near him, though his touch be dangerous. Thus he celebrates by means of these (Mitra and Varuna forms) that (Agni form). 

His Ašvina form is that they produce him by friction through two arins and two wooden sticks, the Asvins being two. Thus he celebrates by means of this (Asvina form) that (Agni form). 

That he burns with a loud crackling voice, imitating the sound bababd, as it were, on account of which all beings flee trembling from him. This is his Indra form. Thus the Hotar celebrates by means of the (Indra form) that (Agni form). 

That they divide him into many parts (when taking fire from the hearth), though he is only one. This is his Viśve Devâh form. Thus the Hotar celebrates by means of this (Visve Devâh form) that (Agni form). 

That he burns with a roaring noise, uttering speech, as it were. This is his Saravatî form. Thus the Hotar celebrates by means of this (Saras vati form) that (Agni form). 

In this way, the triplet of the Sâma singers* becomes celebrated, notwithstanding these (different) deities in the several triplets, for him who thus has commenced (the Sastra) with a verse addressed to Vayu.' 

•The recitation of the Pra-uga Sastra is preceded by the singing of the so-called Ajya-stotru : agna dyahi vitaye (Sama-veda 2, 10-12). The deity of it-is Agni, whilst the deities of the Pra-uga Sastra, to which it is said to stand in connection, are different. 

Glord-sams parśa. See the Kausitaki Bråbmagan 1, 1, whers Agni saya : मह घोरसंस्पर्शतमो ऽस्मि. The Ajya Stotra, see note 1. It consists of three verses.112 

Having repeated the Sastra addressed to all the gods (Pra-uga), he recites a Yájyû mantra addressed (166] to the Viśve Devâh (all gods) : višvebhiḥ somyan madhvagna (l, 14, 10). Thus he satisfies all deities, giving to each his due share. 

5. (On the Vaşatkâra and Anuvaşatkâra.) The Vasatkara!! (the formula vauşat!) is the drinking vessel of the gods. By making the Vaşatkâra, the Hotar satisfies the deities with (presenting) a drinking vessel. 

He makes the Anuvaşatkâra (the formula “Agni, eat!"). In this way, he satisfies the deities by repeatedly placing before them the Vaşat kâra' (representing the dripking vessel), just as men place before their horses or cows repeatedly grass, water, &c." 

- They ask, Why do they sacrifice in the same Agni (the Agni of the Uttarâ Vedi) where they did it before, and make the Vaşatkâra there, when sitting near the Dhişnya'fires (after having left the place near the Uttarâ Vedi) ? (The answer is) By making the louvaştkâra, * Agni, taste the Soma!” he makes there the Vaşatkâra and pleases the Dhişnyas. 

They ask, Which is the Sviştakrit portion of the Soma at those offerings, as of which the priest tastes without having finished them, and vrithout making the Anuvaşatkâra ? (The answer is) By repeating the Anuvaşatkâra (when repeating the Yasyâs for the Sastras)," Agni, taste the Sonia !" they (complete the ceremony and) drink from the Soma juice after the completion (of the [167] ceremony.* This very (Anuvasat kâra) is the Sviştakrit portion of the Soma. (Thence) he makes the Vaşatkâra (and Anuvasatkâra), 

• The Pra-uga sastra is here called vaisyadevam, i.e., belonging to all the gods, on account of the large number of deities, comprising the Visve Devâh containcd ip it. 

10 The paragraphs from 5, 8, are found also with very little change and a few omis sions in the Gopatha Brāhmaṇam 3, 1--5. Both evidently come from one source only. 

"I This is tho full meaning of this as explained by sa yapa. *s See above. in These are the dvidevatya yrasias, seo 2. 

** The priests are not allowed to eat from the sacrificial food, or drink of the Soma, before all the ceremonies pertaining to the offerings to the gods are completed. The Sviptakpit ceremony is regarded as the completion of the principal rites attending any oblation given to the gods. At this ceremony, the Apuvasatkâra does not take place. After it is complcted, the priests are allowed to eat the remainder of the food or drink the remaining juice. 

113 

(On the Veaning of the Vaşatkara and its Different Parts), - 

Tho Vaşatkâra is a weapon. If one has an enemy (and wishes to destroy him), one has only to think of him when making the Vaşatkára, in order to strike him a blowy with a weapon (in the form of the Vaşatkâra). 

The word şat (six) is contained in the formula vau-şațls (the so callod Vaşatkâra). There are six seasons. Thus he makes the seasons and establishes them. He who is established in the seasons becomes afterwards (also) established in all other things. He who has such a kuowledge, obtains a firm footing 

Hiranyadar, the son of Beda, said about this (the Vaşatkâra) as follows: By this part şat (six) of the formula (cauşut), the Hotar estab lishes these six (things). The sky rests on the air; the air on the earth; the earth on the waters.; the waters [188] on the reality (satya); the reality on the Brahma; the Brahma on the concentrated heat of medi tation (tapas). If these places are established, then all things are con sequently established. He who has such a knowledge has a firm footing. 

The part viu of the formula tauşat means the sis seasons. By repeating the Vaşatkára, the Hotar places the sacrificer in the seasons, gives him a footing in them. Just as he does unto the gods, the gods do unto him. 

(The Three Kinds of the Vaşatkâra : Vajra, Damachhad, and Dikta. 

In what Tone the Vasathara is to be Repeated. The Hotar can, by 7200 repeating it lopcrly, injure the Sacrificer.) 

There are three (kinds of the) Vaşatkåra, xu yra iraupaal damachhari. (who covers beings), and rikta (empty, void). 

It is a vajra (weapon), in consequence of its being pronounced with a loud and strong voice by the Hotar. With it be strikes, whenever be pleases, a blow to his enemy and adversary who is to be put down by him, in order to put him down. Thence is this weapon, in the form of the Vaşatkâra, to be used by the sacrificer who has enemies. 

It is damachiad, i.e., protecting the beings, on account of its being pronounced as an integral part of the verse to which it belongs without 

22 

"The etymology which is here given of the word vauçat is of course quite fanciful. It is only a very much lengthened pronunciation of a conjunctive form Loksul, of the root valt, to carry, meaning, may lie (Agni) carry it (the offering) up. Instead of the original ok, du was substituted. 

✓

omitting any part of it. Children and cattle stand near (this part of (169) the Vaşatkâra) and follow it. Thence ought le, who desires children and cattle, to make this Vaşatkâra 

It is rikta, i.e., void, the syallable şat being pronounced with a low accent. He thus makes void (rikta) the soul, and the sacrificer. He who makes such a Vaşatkâra becomes a great sinner, and also be for whom 

such & Vaşatkâra is made. Thence he should not wish to make it. 

As regards the question whether the Hotar unight make the sacrificer happy or unhappy, the answer is, that lie who might be the Hotar of any sacrificer can do so. At this (occasion, i.e., at the sacrifice), the Hotar inay just do with the sacrificer as he pleases. 

Should he wish to deprive the sacrificer of the fruit of his sacrifice, he has only to repeat the (Yajya) verse, and the Vasatkâra in the same tonel? (i.e., monotonously). If he do so, he deprives the sacrificer of the fruit of his sacrifice. 

Should he wish to make the sacrificer liable to the consequences of a great guilt, he has only to repeat the (Yajya) verse with a very loud voice, and the Vaşatkâra with a very low one. (If he do so) he makes the sacrificer liable to the consequences of a great guilt. 

Should he wish to make the sacrificer very happy, he has to repeat the (Yajya) verse with a very low, and the Vasatkâra with a very loud, voice. (That is done) for obtaining fortune. By doing so, he puts the sacrificer in the possession of) fortune. 

The Vaşatkâra is to form an integral part of the (Yajya) verse (no stopping between the end of the (170] verse and vauşat being allowed), in order to have an uninterrupted whole. He who has such a knowledge becomes possessed of children and cattle. 

8. (The Danger which might be imminent upon the llotar and Sacrificer', in con 

sequence of the Vaşatkâra weapon, is to be averted by certain Formulas.) 

The Hotar ought to think of the deity to whom the oblation is given 

10 The term in the original is nirlanarcha, i.e., without losing any part of the Rich. This means, that no vowel is to be dropped at the end of the Yajya verse when Vaugat is joined to it as an integral part. The remark is made on account of the way in which the syllable on (when pravnava is nade) is joined to the last syllablo of a verse In that case, the last vowel disappears and 6 is substituted in its stead If, for instance, the last syllable of the Rich be ya, theu in the Pranava yon is pronounceil. See the rules for making the Pranava in the Samidheni verses, Ašv. br. S. 1, 2. 

1? The Yajya is repeated monotonously, and, at the morning libation, in a low tone, whilst the Vaşatkâra is pronouncod with a lond voice. 

115 

when he is about to repeat the Vaşatkâra. Thus be pleases the deity personally, and addresses the Yâjyâ mantra direct to it. 

The Vasatkâra is a weapon.18 The weapon is like a flash when one strikes with it without having conjured its evil effects. 1° Not every one knows how to conjure it, nor its (proper) place. Therefore the mantra, vag ojah (Asv. Sr. S. 1,5) is at such öccasions, when even many are killed (as is the case in a battle), the propitiation, and the assignation of the proper place after the Vaşatkâra). For this reason, the Hotar has, after every Vaşatkâra, to repeat the Anumantranazo formula, vág ojah. If thus propitiated, the Vaşatkâra does not hurt the sacrificer,* 1 

[ 171] The sacrificer ought to repeat this Anumantrana formula : "0 “Vaşatkâra, do not sweep me away, I will not sweep thee away. I call 

hither (thy) mind with great effort, thou art a shelter baring joined “thy) body with the air circulating (in my body). Go to (thy, place, let "me go to (my) place." 

Some one (a theologian) has said : this (just mentioned anumantranan) is too long and has no effect (Instead of it) the sacrificer ought to repeat after the Vaşatkâra the words, ojah saha ojah. Ojaħ (vigour) and sahal (strength) are the two most beloved bodies (forms) of the Vaşatkâra. By making him repeat this Anumantraņa formula, he thus makes the sacrificer prosper through (the Vaşatkâras) own nature. He, who has such a knowledge, prospers through (the Vaşatkâra's) own nature. 

The Vaşatkâra is speech, and prâna (air inhaled) and apána (air , exhaled). These (three) leave as often as a Vaşatkâra is repeated. (But that ought to be prevented; thence) he ought to include them (their names) in the Anumantrana formula. (This is done by repeating the following formula) vág ojaḥ saha ojo mayi pranâpânâu, i,e., May speech, vigour, strength (and) the prâņa and apâna (be) in me! Thus the Hotar puts speech, prâna and apâna in himself (he prevents them from going), and reaches his full age. He who has such a knowledge reaches his full age. 

15 This idea is clearly expressed in an Anumantrapa formula ; a &tu ar Sear 

a 

\#; i.e., I slay, with the Vasatkâra as a weapon, him who hates us as well as him whom we hate (âsv. Dr. S. 1, 3). 

to For the mischief done by a weapon, he who strikes with it, is aaswerable. To guard himself against the evil consequences of such an act, propitiation (śântz) is required. 

20 This is the technical name of those formulas which are to be repeated by the Hotar and the sacrificer after the proper mantra has been recited. They follow the mantra. Thence the name, anumantrala. They must be always uttered with a low voice. 

21 Up to the present day, the Srotriyas or sacrifical priests never dare to pronounce this formula save at the time of sacrificing. They say that, if they would do po at any other time, they would be cursed by the gods,

The sacrifice went away from the gods They wished it (to l'eturn by means of the Praişas "i (172] That is the reason that the Praisas (orders to repeat a mantra given by the Adhvaryu or Mitra Varuna to the Hotar) are called so (from prato iş, "to wish"). They made it shine forth (prårochayanti) by means of the Puroruks. Thence the Puroruk is called so (from prârochayanti). They found it on the Vedi. Thence this place is called Vedi (from vid, to find). After having found it, they caught it with the Grahns; thence they are called so (from grill, 10 catch, seize). Having found it, they announced it to the gods by means of the Nivids. 

Thence they are called Nivids (from nivedayati, he announces). 

A person who wishes to recover something lost, wants either much (of it) or little. Among two, the elder (most experienced) wislies for the best (portion). He who knows that the Praisas are exceedingly strong (give most power), knows (at the same time) that they are the best portion. The Praişas being the desire to l'ecover something lost, he (the Mitra Varuna) repeats them with his head lowered (777071.vas) (just as suppli cants do). 

10. (On the Proper Place of the Nivids in the Three Litali0175.) The Nivids are the embryos of the Sastras (217thas). At the morning libation, they are put before the Sastras (ukihas), because the embryos are lying in the womb trith their heads turned downtyard, and thus they are born (the head coming first out of the womb). At the midday libation, the Nivids are put in the midst of the Sastras). This is done because the embryos have their hold in the middle of the womb. At the evening libation, the Nivids are repeated at the end of the Sastras), because the embryos are coming down from thence (the womb) [173] when they are brought forth. He who has such a knowledge is blessed with children and cattle 

The Nivids are the decorations of the Sastras. They are put, ai. the morning libation, before the Sastras, just as a weaver weaves deco rations in the beginning of a cloth. 

At the midday libation, they are put in the midst of the Sastras), just as a weaver weaves decorations in the midst (of a cloth). 

At the evening libation, they are put at the end of the Sastras), just as the weaver weaves decorations in the end of a cloth (avaprajjana). 

MAN 

22 The Praisas here alluded to are those used at the animal sacrifice. They corres pond to the Prayája (Aprí) mantras. See the White Yajurveda 21. 29-40, 

He who has such a knowledge is ornamented on all parts with the decora tion of the sacrifice. 

11. 

(How the Nivids should be Repeated. How to Correct Mistakes 

Arising from Confusion.) The Nivids are deities connected with the sun. When they are put at the morning libation at the beginning of the Sastras), at the midday libation in the midst, and at the evening libation at the end, then they follow the regular course of the sun. 

The gods bad obtained (once) one portion of the sacrifice after the Other (pach-chhas). Thence the Nivids are repeated pada by pada. When the gods had obtained the (wbole of the) sacrifice, a horse came out of it. Thence they say, the sacrificar ought to give a horse to the reciter of the Nivids. By doing so (presenting a horse), they present really the most exquisite gift (to the reciter). 

The reciter (of the Nivid) ought not to forego any of its padas. Shoulde he do so, he would make a rupture in the sacrifice; if this (rupture) increases, the sacrificer then becomes guilty of the consequences (174) of a great sin. Thence the reciter ought not to forego any of the padas of the Nivid, 

He ought not to insert the order of tro padas of the Nivid. Should he do so, he would confound the sacrifice, and the sacrificer rould be come confounded. Thence he ought not to insert the order of tiro padas. 

He ought not to take together tito padas of the Nirid. Should he do so, he would confound the sacrifice, which would prore fatal to the sacrificer. Thence he ought not to take together tiro padas of the Nivid mien repeating it. 

He ought to take together only the two padas, predam bralna and predam kşatran.28 If he do so, it is (done) for joining together the Brahma and the Kşatra. Thence the Brahma and Kşatra become joined. 

He ought, for the insertion of the Nirid, to select hymns consisting of more than a triplet, or stanza of four verses ;for the several padas of the Nivid ought to correspond, each to the several verses in the hymn." 

23 These two sentences form part of every Nipid, used at the midday or evening libation. They occur in the following connections: Aiga qaslaag en aan zu s 15 gaara 451ATTHAT I 

96 This refers to the siikta or hymn wbichi stands in connection with the Nivid. 

85 The expression richan súktam prati is evidently a Hendiadpoin; for the distria butive meaning of pratı can only refer to rich, but not to sarkta ; because there are not as maly saktas as there are padas of the Niyid. The sentence, 

pamet 

118 

Thence he ought, for the insertion of the [175] Nivid, to select hymns consisting of more than of stanzas with three or four verses. Through the Nivid the celebration of the Sâman is made excessive. 36 

At the evening libation, he ought to put the Nivid when only one verse (of the Sastra) remains (to be recited). Should he recite the Nivid when two verses (of the Sastra) are still remaining, he would thus destroy the faculty of generation, and deprive the Offspring of their embryos. Thence he ought to repeat the Nivid at the evening libation when only one verse of the Sastra) remains (to be recited). 

He ought not to let fall the Nivid beyond the hymn to which it be longs).*? Should be, however, do it, he ought not to revert to it again (not to use the hymn), the place (where the Nivid is to be put) being de stroyed. He ought in such a case) to select another bymn which is addres sed to the same deity and in the same metre, to put the Nivid into it. 

(In such a case ) he ought, before (repeating the new) Nivid bymn, to recite the hymn : må pragúna (1761 patho vayan (10, 57), i.e., let us not go astray. For he loses his way wlio gets confounded at a sacri fice. (By repeating the second pada) ma yajned indra saminah (10, 57, 1) i.e., (let us not lose) O Indra, the Sona sacrifice, he prevents the sacrificer from falling out of the sacrifice. (By repeating the third pada) ma antal sthur no aråtayah, i.e., “May no wicked men stand among 118 !" he turns away all who have wicked designs, and defeats them, 

In the second verse of this hymn) yo ya jñasyja prasadhanas tantur, j.e., " Let us recover the saine threarl which serves for the performance 

fezii, can easily be misunderstood. At the first glance it appears to mcan "he ought not to think of selecting any other hymn for inserting the Nivid, save such ones as consist of three or four verses." Say. followed this explanation which most naturally sur gests itself to every reader. But, in consideration that all the Nitid hymns, actually in use, and mentioned in the Aitareya Br. exceed in number four vorses (some contain eleven, others even fifteen verses), that explanation cannot be correct. The passage can only have the sense given to it in my translation. 

3* The Sastra thus obtains more verses than are properly required. 

27 The meaning is: he should not repeat the Nivid, after he might have repeater the whole of the hymn in which it ought to have been inserted. Should he, however, have committed such a mistake, then he must select another hymn, and put the Nivici in its proper place, i.e., before the last verse of the hymn. The Hotar is more liable to commit such a mistake at the evening libation than at the two preceding ones. For, at the evening libation, there are seven Nivids (to Savitar, Dyâvâprithivi, Ribhus, Vais vånara, Visvedevâh, Maratas, and Jåtavedas) required, whilst we find at the inorning libation only one (which is rather # Puroruk than i Nivia), and at the middar libation two (to the Marutas and Indra), 

119 

of sacrifice, and is spread among the gods** by means of which was ((hitherto) sacrificed (by us)," the expression tantu (thread) means off spring. By repeating it, the Hotar spreads (santanoti) offspring for the sacrificer. 

(The words of the third verse are) mano nu di Puvâmahe rârâ samsena somena, i.e., "Now we bring an offering** to the mind (manas) by pouring water in the Soma cups (deroting them thus to Naras amsa)." By means of the mind, the sacrifice is spread ; by means of the mind, it is performed. This is verily the atonement at that occasion (for the mistake pointed out above). 


### 02
SECOND CHAPTER. [177] (The Murutvatiya and Nişkevalya Sastrus.) 

12 

(On the Ahava and Pratigara.) They (the theologians) say: the subjects of the gods are to be pro cured. (To achieve this end) one netre is to be put in another metre. (This is done when) the Hotar calls (the Adhvaryu) by sorn sávon, " Let us both repeat, yes !" which (formula) consists of thee syllables. At the morning libation, the Adhvaryu responds (prati-grihnáti) (to this formula of three syllables) with one consisting of five: samsamo daivớn. This makes eight on the whole. The Gâyatri has eight syllables (i, e, each of its three padas). Thus these two (formulas) make the Gâyatri at the com mencement of the recitation at the morning libation. After the Hotar has finished his recitation, he uses this (formula of) four syllables : ultham [178] vdchi, i.e., the recitation has been read, to which the Adhvaryu 

28 Sây, has, in his commentary on the Rigveda Samhita, the followiog remark : देवैः स्तोत्रिभिः ऋत्विग्भिविस्तारितो वर्तते. 29 Of GIEB Say. gives two different explanations in his commentaries on the Ait. Br. and in that on the Rigveda Sanhiti. In the first, he explains it by mean I call hither (from hve to call); in the other, he derives it from illi, to sacrifice. The latter expla nation is preferable. 

! See 1, 9. 

* See about the Pratigara, i.e., response by the Adhvaryu to the recitations of the Hotar, Åsv, br. S. 5, 9. The most common pratigaru repeated by the Adhvaryu is othāno daiva; but at the time of the andva (the call somscivom) it is : samsamo daiva. At the end of the Pratigara, the pranaya, (incorporation of the syllable om) required, is daivôni. 

The formula utham vachi, with some additional words, always concludes a Sastra. In the Kauşîtaki Braumanam (14, 1), and in the Saukhay. Srauta Sätras (8, 16, 17-20), this formula is called achia viryan, In the Âšval, Sutras, no particular name is given to it. The Kauşîtaki and Sankbay. Sábbas differ here a little from that of Âšvalâyana, According to the former, uktham vấchi is always preceded by a few sentences which are 

120 

(responds) in four syllables : om ukthasá, 2.c., thou hast repeated the recita tion* (uktham, sastram). This makes eight syllables. The Gâyatıi consists of eight syllables. Thus the two (formulas) make at the morning libation [179] the Gâyatris at both ends (at the commencement and the end). 

At the midday libation, the Hotar calls: adhoor'Yo sorsåvom, że * Adhvaryu, let us two l'epeat ! Om!” with six syllables ! to which the Adlivaryu responds with fire syllables, the sainsâ mo daivom. This makes eleven syllables. The Triştubli has eleven syllables. Thus he makes the Tristubh at the beginning of the Sastra at the midday libation. After having repeated it, he says, uktham vachi indraya, t.e... the Sastra has been read for Indra, in seven syllables ; to which the Adhvaryu responds in four syllables : on ukthašâ. This makes (also) eleven syllables. The Tristubh has eleven syllables. This the two

not to be found in Äsval. Thus, we have, for instance tlore, at tho cud of the Maruta vatiya Sastra, the following formulas : EPFTET atasi mai proan 274arig In the Åsval. Sutras (3, 14), there is instond of it only: 2941 art19 syuar Al overy Sastra ropcated by tho Hotar, there is a little dilforence in the 

mula The rules, as givon liere in this paragraph, rcfor only to tho conclusion of tho Sastras of tho muinor Hotri priests; they alono conduia 

toost any other appendage (sco Ašval., 10). The concluding formulas for the Holar arc, according to Âšval, dr. S., as follows: 

(a) For the Ajya Sastra i 35 anni giore at (U, 0). (0) For the Pra-uga sastra : 5e are pa1912 cai (3, 10). (c) For the Maratvatîya sastra (see above). (d) For the Niskovalya sastra: 57 a tatesuad a (3, 15). (e) For the Vaišvadeva sastra : 31 art1a *Simca tan (6, 18) (1) For the Agnimaruta saslra: 32 arira 2+1 12012 at (5,20). 

All theso appendages express the idor, that the god to whom the recitation is addressed should hear it, and take notice of it. So głosuriyat turi moans that "it (the recitation) might be soundert to thee;" upuoranziato turi, " that it might be for thy hoaring." Tho active participle in tho proxont touse misú kero have somothing like the meaning of an abstract noun, corresponding with slukriya and (išrului. Litorally, semneriate appears to mean thatós the hearing of this recitation inight como) lo thec." 

After the repetition of these formulas which conclude all nastras, the Yaivd verso belonging to the particular Kastra is recited. 

A This alone can be the meaning of the obscure formula, ikihubir, which comes no doubů from the remotost antiquity. It is perhaps al corruption of ithain séis, tho neutral charac term being left out, Sây, explains : a TETTI. "thou art the repeater ol lbe sastra." But this meaning is not appropriate to the occasion at which the formula is used. This is done only when the rocitation is over. The only proper meaning of the formula therefore is either tho recitation is repeated," or "thou last repeated the recitation." 

3 The Gayatri is the characteristic metre of the morning libation; thenco its form (eight syllables) is to appear in some shape at the commencoment as well as at the end of the Sastrein 

121 

(formulas) make the Triştubh at both ends of the Sastra at the middag libation. 

At the evening libation, the Hotar calls : adhvaryo som-sonsärom, in seven syllables, to which the Avdharyu responds in five syllables : śarsâ mo daivom. This makes twelve syllables. The Jagati has twelve syllables. Thus (with thess two formulas taken together) he makes the Jagatî at the beginning of the Sastra at the evening. libation. After having repeated the Sastra, he says, in eleven syllables: uktham vấchi indraya devebhyah, 1.C., "the Sastra has been repeated for Indra," for the Devas, to which the Adhvaryu responds in one syllable: om! This makes twelve syllables. The Jagatî has twelve syllables. Thus the two (formulas) make the Jagati at both ends at the evening libation. 

This (the mutual relation of the three chief metres to one another and to the sacrificer) saw a Rişi, and expressed (his opinion) in the mantra: yad gayatre adhi (1, 164, 23), 3.6., “those who know that [180] the Gayatri is put over a Gâyatri, and that out of a Triştubh a (another) Trishţubh is formed, and a Jagat (Jagatí) is put in a Jagat, obtain immortality. 96 

In this way, he who has such a knowledge puts metre in metre, and procures " the subjects of the gods." 

13. (On the Distribution of the Metres among the Gods. Å nuştubh 

Prajâpati's Metre.) Prajapati allotted to the deities their (different) parts in the sacrifice and metres. He allotted to Agni and the Vasus at the morning libation the Gayatri, to Indra and the Rudras the Tristubh at the mid day libation, and to the Viấve Devâh and Adityas the Jagati at the evening libation. 

His (Prajapati's) own metre yas Anuştubh. He pushed it to the end (of the Sastra), to the verse repeated by the Achhâvâka (which is the last). Anuştubh said to him: “Thou art the most wicked of all gods; for thou hast me, who am thy metre, pushed to the end (of the Sastra), to the verse repeated by the Achhâvå ka." He acknowledged (that he had wronged her). (In order to give redress) he took his own Soma (sacrifice) and put at the beginning, at the very mouth of it, 

• The meaning is, that no pada of a metre, neither that of the Gâyatri nor Triştubh, nor Jagati can stand alone, but must be joined to another pada of the same metre. The anava and pratigara must, therefore, be at the beginning as well as at the end of the Sastra in the same metre, for each time they consist only of one pada, and that is not auspicious.122 

Anustubh. Thence Anuştubh is joined (to the Sastras, as the first metre as the very mouth-piece at all libations. 

He who has such a knowledge becomes the first, the very mouth (of the others), and attains to supremacy. Prajâpati having thus made (the beginning [181] of all libations) at his own Soma sacrifice (with Anuştubb), the sacrificer (who does the same) becomes master of the sacrifice, and the latter becomes (properly) performed. Wherever a sacrificer has a sacrifice performed, so that he remains master of it, it is performed for this (the whole) assemblage of men? (who miglit be with the sacrificer). 

(How Agni, as Hotar of the Gods, Escaped the Meshes of Death.) 

When Agni was the Hotar of the Gods, Death sitting in the Bahis pavamapa Stotra lurked for him. By commencing the Ajya Sastra! with the Anuştubh metre, he overcame Death. Death repaired to the Ajya Sastra lurking for Agui. By beginning (to repeat) the Pra-uga Sastra, he overcame Death (again). 

At the midday libation, Deatlı sat in the Pavamâna Stotra? o lurking for Agni. By commencing the Marutvatiya Sastra with Anustubh, he overcame Death. Death could not sit, at that libation, in the Brihati verses (repeated by the Hotar at the commencement of the Nişkevalya Sastra). For the Brilatîs are life. Thus Death could not take away the life. This is the reason that the Hotar begins (the Nişkevalya Sastra) with the Stotriya triplet (corresponding to the Sâraan which is sung) in the Brihatî metre. The Bribatis are life. By commencing [182] his second Sastra (with Brihatis), he has the preservation of (his) life in view. 

At the evening libation, Death sat in the Pavamâna Stotra lurking. for Agni. By commencing the Vaišvadeva Sastra with Anuştubh, Agni overcame Death. Death repaired to the Yajnza yajniya Sûman." By 

? The sacrificer is to make the sacrifice, i.e., the sacrificial man, his own, i.e., he must subject it to his own will, just as Prajapati did. Thus he makes it beneficial to others. Just as Prajapati benefited gods and men by it. 

See page 120. 

See the hymn : pra vo devaya agnaye, 2, 35, which is ir the Anustubh metre and which is meant here. 

10 Uchchâ te jấtan andhaso. Samaveda Sainh. 2. 22-20. 

AST y at Sâmaveda sanih, 2, 53-54, 

123 

commencing the Agni-Maruta Sastra, with a hymn addressed to Vais vânara, he overcame Death. For the hymn addressed to Vaišvânara is a weapon; the Yajna yajniya Sâman is the place. By repeating the Vais vânara hymn, he thus turns Death out of his place. 

Having escaped all the meshes of Death, and his clubs, Agni came off in safety. The Hotar who has such a knowledge, comes off in safety, preserving his life to its full extent, and attains to his full age (of a hun dred years). 

15. (Marutvatiya Sastra. Indra Conceals Eimself. How he was found.) 

Indra, after having killed Vritra, thought, 'I might perhaps not have subdued him (apprehending his revival), and went to very distant regions. He (ultimately) arrived at the most distant place. This place is Anus gubh, and Anustubh is Speech. He having entered Speech, lay down in her. All beings scattering themselves here and there went in search of him. Tbe Pitaras (manes) found him one day earlier than the gods. This is the reason that ceremonies are performed in honour of the Pitaras previous to the day on which they sacrifice for the gods. I* They (the gods) said, " Let us squeeze the [188] Soma juice ; (then) Indra will come to us very quickly." So they did. They squeezed the Soma juice. By repeating the verse, a tva ratham (8, 57, I), they made him (Indra) turn (towards the Soma jaice). By the mantra, idam vaso sutan (8, 2, 1), he became visible to the gods on account of the term (suta), i.eu, squeezed (contained in it). 18 By the mantra, indra nediya ed ihi (8, 53, 5),they made him (Indra) come into the middle (of the sacri ficial place). 

He who has such a knowledge, gets his sacrifice performed in the presence of Indra, and becomes (consequently successful by means of the sacrifice, having Indra (being honoured by his presence). 

16. 

(Indra-Nihava Pragatha.) As Indra bad killed Vritra, all deities thinking that he bad not conquered him, left him. The Maruts alone, who are his own rela tions, 16 did not leave him. The "maruto svåpayah" (in the verse, Indra 

12 The Pitaras are worshipped on the Amavasyâ day (New Moon), and the Darsa pürpima isti takes place on the pratipada (first day after the New Moon).-.-Sây. 

10 These two first are called the pratipad and anuchara of the Marutvatîy Sastra, the beginning verse and the sequel, 

** This mantra is called, indra-nihava pragcitia, i.e., pragâtha for calling Indra near. 

do Svàpi, which term occurs in the Indra-Nihava Pragatha (8, 58, 5), is explained by Sây. gegara sf arat: But this interpretation, which is founded on Vedantic ideas strange to the poets of the Vedic hymns, is certainly wrong ; for, "being 

124 

nediya) are the vital airs. The vital airs did not leave him (184] (Indra). Thence this Pragatha, which contains the term svåpi (in the pada) â svâpe svâpibhir, is constantly repeated at the midday libation of all Soma sacrifices). When, after this (Pragathal, a mantra addressed to Indra is repeated, then all this is termed) Marutvatiya (Sastra). If this unchangeable Pragatha, containing the term svâpi, is repeated then always the Marutvatîya Sastra is made). 

17. . (Brâhmanaspati Pragatha. To achat Stotras the Indra-Nihava and 

Brahmanaspati Pragatha belong. The Dháyyds ) 

He repeats the Pragâthale addressed to Brâhmanaspati. Led by Brihaspati as Purohita (spirirual guide), the gods conquered the celestial world, and were (also) victorious everywhere in this world. Thus the sacrificer who is led by Brihaspati as his Purohita, conquers the celestial world, and is (also) victorious everywhere in this world. 

These two Pragathas, 1? not being accompanied by a chant, are recited with repetition 18 (of the last pada of each verse). They ask, “How is it that these two Pragathas, which are not accompanied by a chant, are re cited with repetition (of the last pada of each verse), the rule being that no Sastra verse can be recited with such a repetition, if it be not accompani ed by a chant ?" (The answer is) The Marutvatîya (Sastra) [185] is the recitation for the Pavamâna Stotra ;19 they perform this Stotra (in singing), with six verses in the Gâyatri, with six in the Brihatî, and with three in profound sleep," does not suit the sense of the passage at all. How could the Marutas assist Indra when they were in profound sleep" (susupti)? In order to countenance his interpretation, Sây, refers to the meaning "prcina," life, attributed to the word by the author of the Ait. Br. itself in this passage. The word is, however, to be traceable only to su-api or svampīpi. That api means “friend, associate," follows from several passages of the Samhita. See Boehtlingk and Roth's Samskrit Dictionary, i., p. 660. 

18 A Pragatha comprises two richas, according to Âšv. Sr. S. 5, 14; TET: E RT car g ai: i. e, the Pratipad (opening of the Marutvatîya Sastra) and its Anuchara (sequel) consist of three richas, the Pragathas of two richas. 

17 The Indra-Nihava and Brahmanaspatyah Pragatha. 

19 The two Pragatha verses are to be repeated, so as to form a triplet. This is achieved by repeating thrice the fourth pada of each verse, if it be in the Brihatî metre, In a similar way, the Sâna singers make of two verses three. 

1: The Pavamâna Stotra or the performance of the Sama singers at the beginning of the midday libation, consists only of three verses in the Gayatri (uchchi te játo,Saunaveda, 

2, 22-24), of two in the Brihatî (punánah Soma, 8. V, 2, 25, 28) and three in the Tris. tubh metre (pra tu drava pari kośam, S. V, 2, 27-29). The three Gayatris are sung twice, thus six are obtained, and the two Bribatis are twiee repeated in such a manner as to produce each time three verses (by repeating thrice the last pada of each verse), which makes also six. Sâma prayoya, 

125 

in the Triştubh metres. Thus, the Pavamâna (Stoma) of the midday libation comprises three metres, and is fifteen-fold.20 They ask, " How becomes this Pavamâna Stoma celebrated (by a Sastra) ?" The two last verses of the Pratipad triplet (8, 57, 1-3, å två ratham) (186] are in the Gayatri metre (the first being Anuştubh), and also the triplet which forms the sequel (of the Pratipad) is in the Gayatri metre. Thus the Gayatri verses (of the Pavamâna Stotra) become celebrated. By means of these two Pragathas (the Indra-Nihava and Brâhmaṇaspati Pragatha, which are in the Brihatî metre) the Brihatî verses (of the Pavamâna Stotra) become celebrated. 

The Sâma singers perform this chant with these verses in the Brihati metre, by means of the Raurava and Yaudhaja Såmans (tunesal), repeating thrice (the last pada of each verse). This is the reason that the two Pra gâthas, though they have no Stoma belonging to them, are recited with repeating thrice (the last pada of each verse). Thus the Stotra is in ac cordance with the Sastra. 

Two Dhâyydsås are in the Triştubb metre, and also the hymnos in which the Nivid is inserted. By these verses in the Triştubh metre), are the Triştubhs of the Stotra celebrated. In this way, the Pavamâna 

30 For the explanation of this and similar terms, Sayapa refers always to the Bråhma. nas of the Sâmaveda. Tha explanatory phrase of the panchadas'ah stoma of the Samaveda theologians is constantly the following : farar esta a: fagf: E91 E ETI 17 

यो हिं करोति स एकया । सतिसृभिः स एकया पंचभ्यो हि करोति स एकया स एकया स तिमृभिः These enigmatical words are utterly unintelligible without oral information, which I was happy enough to obtain. They refer to the number of verses obtained by repetition of the triplet which forms the text of a Saman, The Så man consists of two verses only : it is first to be made to consist of three, by repetition of some feet of the two principal verses, before it can be used as a chant at the Soma sacrifices. After a triplet of verses has been thus obtained, it is to be chanted in three turas, each turn containing in three subdivi sions a certain number of repetitions. This number of repetitions is indicated by three rows of wooden sticks of the Udumbara tree, called lcuści, each row comprising five (if the Stoma is the panchadasa, the fifteen-fold), which the three Sama singers must arrange according to a certain order before they can chant the Saman. Each row is called at puryâya. The several sticks in each row are placed in the following order : 1st row in a straight, I across, 1 in a straight, line ; 2nd row~1 in a straight, 3 across, 1 in a straight, line; 3rd row-1 in a straight, 1 across, 5 in a straight, line. As often as the sticks of one row are laid, the Sama singer atters the sound him. This apparatus is regarded as quite essential for the successful chanting of the Saman. See more on this subject in the notes to 8, 42. 

22 These are the names of the two peculiar tunes in which the verses, princinah some and duhana údhar (Så maveda S, %, 25-26) are sung. 

22 See 3, 18 : the two first, agnir netâ, and toam Soma fratubhih are in the Triştubh metre,

126 

Stoma, comprising three metres, being fifteen-fold, becomes celebrated for him who has such a knowledge. 

18 (On the Origin of the Dhâyyâs, their Nature and Meaning.) 

He recites the Dhâyyâs. Prajâpati had (once) sucked up from these worlds everything he desired (187) by means of the Dhảyyâs (from dhe, to suck). Thus the sacrificer who has such a knowledge sucks up from these worlds everything he desires. The nature of the Dhâyyâs is. that the gods at a sacrifice, wherever they discovered a breach, covered it with a Dhâyyâ; thence they are so called (from dhli, to put). The sacrifice of him, who has such a knowledge, becomes performed without any breach in it. 

As to the Dhâyyås, we sew up with them (every rent in the) sacrifice, just as we sew up (a rent in) a cloth with a pin that it might become mended. A breach in the sacrifice of him who has such a knowledge becomes thus mended. 

As to the Dhâyyâs, they are the recitations for the Upasads.24 The verse, Agnir netd (3, 20, 4), which is addressed to Agni, is the recitation for the first Upasad ; the verse, toum Soma kratubhik, which is addressed to Soma (1, 91, 2), is the recitation for the second Upasad; the verse pinvanty apo (1, 64, 6), which is addressed to Vişnu, is the recitation for the third Upasad. Whatever place one may conquer by means of the Soma sacrifice, he who, having such a knowledge, recites the Dhâyyâs, conquers (it only) by the several Upasads. 

About this last Dhîyyâ, some say, the Hotar ought (instead of pinvanty apo) to repeat lân ro maho (2, 34, 11), asserting, "we distinctly know that this verse is repeated as the third Dhûyya) among the Bharatas." But this advice is not to be cared for. Should the Hotar repeat that verse (tản vo maho), he would prevent the rain from coming, for Parjanya has power over the rain (but there is no allusion to him in that verse). But if he repeat the verse pinvanty apo, where there is a pada referring to rain (the third atyam na mihe), and one referring to the Marutas [188] (the storms accompanying the rain, in the first pada), and the word viniyanti, “they carry off," which refers to Vişnu, whose characteristic feature is said to be vichakrame, 2.c., he strode (thrice through the universe), which meaning is (also) implied in the term vinayanti, and (where is further in it) the word, vajie," being laden with booty,” referring to Indra (then the rain would come). This vese has four padas, and (as we have seen) refers to raio, the Marutas, Vişnu, 

24 See Ait. Br. 1, 23-25, 

127 

and Indra, and, though (on account of these allusions just mentioned, and its being in the Jagatî metre) properly belonging to the evening libation, it is repeated at the midday libation. Therefore the cattle of the Bharatas which are at their stables at evening (for being milked) repair at noon to a shed erected for giving all the cows shelter (against heat). That verse (pinranty apo) is in the Jagatî metre; cattle are of the Jagatî nature; the soul of the sacrificer is the midday. Thus the priest provides cattle for the sacrificer (when he recites this verse as a Dhâyyâ at the midday libation). 

19. (The Marutvatiya Pragatha. The Nivid hymn of the Marutvatiya Sastra. How the Hotar can injure the sacrificer by misplacing the Nirid.) 

He repeats the Marutvatîya Pragatha (pra va indraya brihate, 8, 78, 3). The Marutas are cattle, cattle are the Pargatha (that is to say, the Pragâtha is used) for obtaining cattle. 

He repeats the hymu janiştha ugrah (10, 73). This hymn serves for producing the sacrificer. For, by means of it, the Hotar brings forth the sacrificer from the sacrifice as the womb of the gods. By this (hymn) victory is obtained; with it the sacrificer remains victor, without it he is defeated. 

[189] This bynu was (seen) by (the Rişi) Gauriviti. Gauri viti, the son of Sakti, having come very near the celestial world, saw this hymn (i.e., had it revealed); by means of il, he gained heaven. Thus the sacrificer gains by this (byma) the celestial vorld. 

Having repeated half the number of verses of this hynn), he leaves out the other half, and inserts the Nivid *in the midst of both 

22 This is not strictly in accordance with the rules laid down by Ásvalāyana, who in his Srauta Sutras, 5, 14: frer SETTET: Tear Acaciat fara ZenF EY 

ATENTE i.e., the Nivid sakta is, janiştha ugrah, After having repeated one verse more than half the pumber of verses (the whole has eleven verses) of which it consists, he ought to insert the Nivid. That ought always to be done at the bidday libation, where the number of verses of the Nivid Sakta is uneven. The sakta janiştha ugra consists of eleven verses. The number being uneven, the Marutyatîya Nivid is put in the hymn janiştha ugra after the sixth verse, which concludes with you. The text of this Nivid (see the Sankhâyâna Sätras, 8, 18) is (according to Sapta Hantra) as follows: शोसावो३ मिन्द्रो महत्वान्तसोमस्य पिबतु । मरुस्तोत्रो मरुद्रयः। मरुत्सखा मरुधः । धुन्वृत्रा सृजदपः। मरुतामोजसा सह । य ईमेनं देवा अन्वमदन् । असूर्ये वृत्रतूर्य । शंबरहत्ये गविष्ठौ । अर्चतं गुह्या पदा । परमस्या परावति । श्रादी ब्रह्माणि बंधयन् । अनाधष्ठान्योजसा । कृण्वं देवेभ्यो दुवः । मरुद्भिः सखि भिः सह । इन्द्रो मरुत्वा इह श्रवदिह सोमस्य पिबतु । प्रेमा देवो देवहूतिमवतु देव्या धिया । प्रेदं ब्रह्म प्रेदं चन्नम् । प्रदं सुन्वन्तं यजमान अवतु । चित्रश्चित्राभिरूतिभिः । श्रवद् ब्रह्माण्यावसागमत् । 16., May Indra with the Marutas drink of the Soma. He has the praise of the Marutas ; he has (with him) the assemblage of the Marutas. He is the friend of 

wth 

128 

parts). The Nivid is (190) the ascent to heaven; it is the ladder for climbing up to heaven. Therefore) he ought to recite it (stopping at regular intervals) as if he were climbing up (a height) by means of a : ladder. Thus he can take along with him (up to the celestial world) that sacrificer to whom he is friendly. Now, he who desires heaven, avails himself of this opportunity of going thither. 

Should the Hotar intend to do any harm (to the sacrificer) thinking, "may I slay the Vis through the Ksatra," he need only repeat the Nivid in three different places of the hymn in the commencement, middle. and end). For the Nivid is the Kşatram (commanding power), and the hymn the Vis (prototype of the Vaisyas); thus he slays the Vis of any one whom he wishes through his Kşatra." Thus he slays the Vis through the Kşatram. 

Should he think, “may I slay the Kşatram through the Vis," he need only thrice dissect the Nivid through the hymn (by repeating the hymn at the commencement, in the iniddle, and at the end of the Nivid). The Nivid is the Kşatram, and the [191) hymn is Vis. He thus slays whosoever Kşatra he wishes by means of the Vig. 

Should he think, "I will cut off from the sacrificer the Vis (relation, subject, offspring) on both sides," he need only dissect (at the beginning and end) the Nivid by the call somsarom. Thus he cuts the sacrificer off from his Vis on both sides (from father and mother, as well as from his children). Thus he should do who has sinister designs towards the 

the Marutas, he is their help. He slew the enemies, he released tho watera (kept back by the demons of the air) by means of the strength of the Marutas. The gods lol lowing him rejoiced at the defeat of tho) Asuras, the conquest of Vritra, at the killing of Sambara, at the battle (for conquering cows). Him (Indra) when he was repeating the secret verses, in the highest region, in a remote placo, made the sacred rites and hymns (brahmani) grow (increase in strength); these (sacred ritos) are througbe their power inviolable. He makes presents to the gods, ho who is with the Marutas his friends, May Indra with the Marutas here hear (our prayor), and drink of the Soma. May the god come to his oblation offered to the gods with (our) thoughts being directed to the gods. May he protect this Bralca (spiritual power), may he protect this Kmatram (worldly power), may he protect the sacrificer who prepares this (the Soma juice), (may he come) with his manifold helps. diay lie (Indra) hear the sacred hymns (Brahm ani), may be come with (his) aid! 

96 These sentences can be only understood when one bears in mind, that men of the higher caste are supposed to have a share in a certain prototype, Keatra represents the commanding power. A Brahman, deprived of his Kvatra, loses all influence and becomes quite insignificant in worldly things; it deprived of his Vis, he loses his means of subsistence. A Ksatriya loses his power, if deprived of his kyatram, and his subjects, it deprived of his Viš. 

129 

sacrificer. But otherwise (in the manner first described) he should do to him who desires for heaven (if he be friendly to him). 

He concludes with the verse, vayah suparna upasedur (10, 73, 11), j.e., "the poets with good thoughts have approached Indra, begging like birds with beautiful wings ; uncover him who is enshrouded in darkness; fill the eye (with light); release us who are bound (by darkness), as it were, with a rope (nidhâ)." When he repeats the words "uncover him," &c., then he should think that the darkness in which he is enshrouded, might go by means of his mind. Thus he rids himself of darkness. By repeating the words, “ fill the eye,” he should repeatedly rub both his eyes. He who has such a knowledge, keeps the use of his eyes up to his old age. In the words, "release us," &c., the word nidha means rope, The meaning is, release us who are tied with a rope, as it were. 

20.: (Why the Marutas ore Honoured with a separate Sastra.) 

Indra, when he was about to kill Všitra, said to all the gods, ** Stand near me, help me." So they did. They rushed upon Vritra to kill him. He perceived they were rushing upon him for the purpose of (192) killing him. He thought, “ I will frighten them.” He breathed at them, upon which all the gods were flung away and took to flight; only the Marutas did not leave him (Indra); they exhorted him by saying, "Strike, O Bhagavan ! kill (Vritra)! show thy prowess !” This saw a Rişi, and recorded it in the verse vritrasya tra svasathad (8, 85, 7), i.e., "all the gods who were associated with Indra) left him when flung away by the breathing of Vritra. If thou keepest friendship with the Marutas, thou wilt conquer in all these battles (with Vritra)." 

He (Indra) perceived, "the Marutas are certainly my friends; these (men) love me! well, I shall give them a share in this (my own) celebra tion (Sastra)." He gave them a share in this celebration. Formerly both (Indra as well as the Marutas) had a place in the Niskevalya, "7 Sastra. (But to reward their great services he granted them more, viz., a separate Marutvatiya Sastra, &c.). The share of the Marutas (in the midday libation) is, that the Adhvaryu takes the Marutvatiya Graha, and the Hotar repeats the Maratvatîya Pragatha, the Marutvatiya hymn, and the Marutvatiya Nivid. After having repeated the Marutvatiya Sastra, he 'recites the Marutvatiya Yâjyâ. Thus he satisfies the deities by giving them their shares. (The Marutvatiya Yâjyà is) ye tvähihatye maghavan (3, 47, 4), i.e., "drink Indra, the Sona juice, surrounded by thy host, the

Marutas who assisted thee, O Maghavan, in the battles with the huge serpent (Ahi)," &c. Wherever Indra remained victor in his various engagements, through their assistance, wherever be displayed his prowess. there (in the feast given in his honour) be announced them (the Marutas) as bis associates, and made them share in the Soma juice along with him. 

(193) 21. (Indre wishes for Prujâ puti's rank. Wley Prajapati is called Kah. 

Indra's share in the Sacrifice.) Indra, after having slain Vritra and remained victor in various battles. said to Prajapati, "] will have thy rank, that of the supreme deity ; [ will be great !” Prajâpati said, “Who am I" (ko ahan)? Indra answered, “Just, what thou hast told( i.e., kart, who?)" Thence Prajâpati received the name kah, who ? Prajapati is (the god) kan, who? Indra is called mahendra, 2.e., the great Indra, because he had become great (greater than all the other gods). 

He, after having become great, said to the gods, "Give me a dis tinguished reception !"38 just as one here (in this world) who is (great) wishes for (honourable) distinction, and lie who attains to an eminent position, is great. The gods said to him, “Tell it yourself what shall be yours (as a mark of distinction)." He answered, “ This Mahendra Soma jar (Graha, among the libations that of the midday, among the Sastras the Nişkevalya, among the metres the Triştubh, and among the Sámans the Priştha:"a9 They thus gave him these marks of distinc tion. They give them also to him who has such a knowledge. [194] The gods said to him, "Thou hast chosen for thyself all; let some of these things (just mentioned) be our also." He said, “No, why should anything belong to you?" They answered, “Let it belong to us, Magha van." He only looked at them (as if conniving). 

2Of the words Hara Sayâ na gives the following explanation : 5: GREET विशेषो हियते संपाद्यते सोऽयं सत्कार उद्वारस्तं सस्कारभाग में मदर्थ उद्धरत पृथक कुरुतेति 

29 Prişlha is a combination of two Sima triplets for singing. Here the principal chant of the Niskevalya Sastra, which is the centre of the whole Soma feast, is to be understood. At the Agniştoma, this chant is the Rathantaram. The four Stotras at the midday libation, which follow the Pavamâna Stotra, are called Printha Stotras. For they are capable of entering into the combination, called Pţiştha, by putting in the midst of them another Saunan. At the Agnistoma, the actual Pristha is, however, not required. The four Pșiştha Stotras of the midday libation are, the Rathantaran, Vámadevyam Naudhasam, and Kaleyam.

22. 

(Story of Prusaha, the wife of Indra. On the Origin of the Dhayya verse of the Nişkevalyı Śastra. Huwa King can defeat a hostile army. All gods have a share in the Yâjya in the Virat metre. On the Importance of the Virat metre at this occasion.) 

The gods said, “There is a beloved wife of Indra, of the Vâvâta so order, Prâsahâ by name. Let us inquire of her (what Indra's intention is)." So they did. They inquired of her (what Indra's intention was). She said to them, "I shall give you the anster to-inorrow.” For vomen ask their husbands; they do so during the night. On the morning the gods went to her (to inquire). She addressed the following (verses) to thein : yad vâvâna purutamain? (10, 74, 6), i.e, what Indra, the slayer of Vritra, the con [195] queror in many battles of old has gained, filling (the world) with his name (fame), by what he showed himself as master in conquering (präsahaspati), as a powerful (hero), that is what we beseech him to do (now); may he do it.” Indra is the mighty husband of Prâsaha.** (The last pada) “ that is what ive beseech him," &c., means, he will do what we have told him.'s 

Thus she (Prâsahâ) told them. The gods said, “ Let her have a share here (in this Nişkevalya Sastra) who has not yet obtained one in it (na vâ vidat). * So they did. They gave her (a share) in it; thence this verse, yad vdvâna, &c., forms part of the (Nişkevalya) Sastra.8 

The army (send) is Indra's beloved wife, Vâvâta, Prâsaha by name. Prajapati is by the name of kah (who?) his father-in-law. If one wish 

30 The wives of a king are divided into three classes, the first is called mahişi, the second vâvâta, the third or last pariurikti. Sây. Vàváta is in the Rigveda Samhita, 8, 84, 14, a name of Indra's two horses. Sayana in his cominentary on the passage, proposes tio etymologies, from the root var to obtain, and vâ to go. The latter is the most probable. 

al That part of the Samhita where it.occurs, not being printed yet, I put this verse here in full : 

यद्वावान पुरुतम पुरापालावृत्रहेन्द्रो नामान्यप्राः। 

अचेति प्रासहस्पति स्तविष्मान्यदीमुश्मसि कतवे करत्तत् ।। is taken by Sayaņa in both his commentaries on the Aitareya Brâhmanan, and the Rigveda Samhita in the sense of a present tense of But it is here conjunctive, which word alone gives a good sense. Besides, the present tense is never formed ia this way. 

32 The author takes prásahaspati in the sense of husband of a wife, Prisahá, above mentioned. 

** I take here akarat in the sense of a future tense. Let, the Vedic conjunctive. has often this meaning. Såy, takes it in the sense of up. 

* This is nothing but an attempt at an etymology of the name vävdîtu. That it is per fectly childish, every one may see at a glance. 

55 This verse, frequently used at various sacrifices, is the so-called Dhiyycê of the Niskevalya Sastra at the midday libation,132 

that his army might be victorious, then he should go beyond the battle line (occupied by his own army), cut a stalk of grass at the top and end, and throw it against the other (hostile) army by the words, prasahe kas tvá paśyati ? i.e., “O Prâsaha, who sees thee ?" If one who has such a knowledge cuts a stalk of grass at the top and end, and throws (the parts cut) against the other (hostile) army, saying prasahe kas två paśyati ? it becomes split and dissolved, just as a daughter-in-law becomes abashed and faints, when seeing her father-in-law (for the first time). 

(198) Indra said to them (the gods), “You also shall have a share) in this (Sastra).” The gods, said, “Let it be the Yâjyâ verse, * * in the Virât. metre of the Niskevalya Sastra” The Virât has thirty three syllables. There are thirty-three gods, vikr, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, (one) Prajapati, and (one) Vaşatkâra. He (thus) makes the deities participate in the syllables; and according to the order of the syllables they drink, and become thus satisfied by (this) divine dish. 

Should the Hotar wish to deprive the sacrificer of his house and estate, he ought to use for his Yâjyå along with the Vaşatkâra a verse which is not in the Virâ ç metre, but in the Gayatri or Triştubl, or any other metre (save the Virat); thus be deprives him of his house and estate. 

Should he wish to procure a house and estate for the sacrificer, he ought to repeat his Yâjyâ in the Virâț metre : piba somam indra mandatu, (7,-22, 1). By this verse, he procures for the sacrificer a house and estate. 

28. (On the Close Relationship between Saman and Rik. Why the Sama Singers require three pichas. The five-fold division of both. Both are contained in the Virát. The five parts of the Nişkevalya Sastra.) 

First there existed the Rik and the Sâman (separate from one an other); sê was the Rik, and the name amah was the Såman. Sa, which was Rik, said to the Saman,“ Let us copulate for begetting children." The Sâman answered, "No; for my greatness exceeds (yours!." (Thereupon) the Rik became two; both spoke (to the Saman to the same effect); but [ 197 ) it did not comply with their request. The Rik became three (divided into three); all three spoke (to the Sâman to the same effect). Thus the Så man joined the three Richas. Thence the Sâina singers use for their chant three Richas, (that is) they perform their work of chanting 

** This is piba somam indra (7, 221). 

* The Sáman, to which the Nişkevalya Sastra of the Hotar refers, is the Rathan taram. It consists only of two richas (verses), viz., ablli tva süra and na tvavan (Samaveda Samh. 2, 30, 31), but by the repetition of certain parts of these two verses, three are produced. See about this process, called punaradayam, above, 

133 

with three Richas. (This is so also in worldly affairs.) For one man has many wives (represented by the Richas), but one wife has not many husbands at the same tine. From sô and amaḥ having joined, sâma was produced. Thence it is called så man. He who has such a knowledge becomes saman, z.e., equal, equitous. He who exists and attains to the highest rank, is a saman, whilst they use the word asâmanya, i.e.g. inequitous, partial, as a term of reproach. 

Both, the Rik as well as the Sâmap, were prepared (for sacrificial use) by dividing either into five ( 198 ) separate parts: (1) ahava (the call somşávom at the commencement of the Sastras, and himkára (the sound hum, commencing every Sâman); (2) the prastara (prelude, first part of the text of the Saman) and the first rich out of the three, required for the Sâman of the Nişkevalya Sastrasl; (3) the udgétha (principal part of the Saman), and the second rich; (4) the pratihara (response of the Sâman), and the last rich (out of the three); (5) nidhanam (the finale of the Saman) and the call vouşat (at the end of the Yajyâ verses). Thence they say, the sacrifice is 

38 The same etymology is given in the Chhåndogya Upanişad, 3, 6, 1-6, p. 58 in the Calcutta edition of the Bibliotheca Indica): # AT TAFaceTa i.e., the earth is sa, and fire ama, whence comes Sâma. The author of this Upanişad also supposes that the Sama rests on the Rik, the latter being compared to the earth, the first to the fire burning on her. This etymology is wholly untenable from a philological point of view. The crude form is not sima, but saman; thence the derivation of the second part of the word from ama (a noun ending in a, not an) falls to the ground. The first part sê is regarded as the feminine of the demonstrative pronoun, and said to mean Rik, for Rik is a feminine. But such monstrous formations of words are utterly strange to the Sanskrit language and sanctioned by no rules of the grammariaus, In all probability we have to trace the word semar to the root so, “ to bind," whence the word avasäni, i.e., pause, is derived. It thus means to what is bound, strung together," referring to the peculiar way of chanting the Samans. All sounds and syllables of one of the parts of a Sâman are so chanted, that they appear to be strung together, and to form only one long sound. 

** Many Sabans are divided into four or five parts. See the note to 2, 22. If five parts are mentioned, then either the hirkara, which precedes the prastáva, is counted as a separate part, or the pratihara part divided into two, pratihåra and upadrava, the latter generally only comprising a few syllables. 

In order to better illastrate the division of Saurians into five parts, I give here the Rathantaram, according to these divisions : 

First sich-(1), prastáva :- 11 7 a IT agat a 

(2) udgitha. HITTIT a da TAATET Fra: gar eru (3) pratihira : ATESTAT GTI (4) apadrava FA tar et sari 

(5) nidhanam : 1 Becond rich--(1) prastáva : surat 

ME 

(199) five-fold (is a pentad). Animals are five-fold (consist of five parts, four feet and a mouth). 

(Both, the Rik and the Sâman, either of which is divided into five parts, are contained in the Virât, which consists of ten syllables). 4° Thence they say, the sacrifice is put in the Virât, which consists of ten parts. 

(The whole Nişkevalya Sastra also consists of five parts, analogous to the five parts of the Sâman and the Rik at this Sastra.) The stotriya is the soul ; the anuripa is offspring, the dhåyynt is the wife, animals are the pragatha, the suktam is the house. 41 

He who has such a knowledge, lives in his premises in this world, and in the other, with children and cattle. 

24. (The Stotriya, Anuripa, Dhâyyâ, Sama-Pragatha and Nivid Sukta of the Nişkevalya Sastra.) 

He repeats the Stotriya. He recites it with a half loud voice. By doing so, he makes his own soul (the Stotriya representing the soul). 

(2) udgítha : Wat er aan ar partefaent a arat: (3) pratihára: Fiat * 

(9) upadrava : Trear ar ei ga! 

(5) nidhanam il Third rich : (1) prastáva ar i

(5) nidhanam: a Agnistoma Sám Prayaga, 

Hrom this specimen the reader will easily learn in what way they make of two richas three, and how they divide each into five parts. The prastava is chanted by the Prastotar, the udgitha by the Udgåtar (the chief of the Sama singers), the pratihůra by the pratihartar, the upadrava by the Udgâ tar, and tho nidhanam by all three. 

4 This statement is not very accurate. In other passages it is said, that it consists of thirty-three syllables, see 3, 22. The metre is divided into three padas, each consisting of nine, ten, or eleven syllables. 

* Here are the five parts of the Nixkevalya Sastra - severally enumerated. The stotriya are the two verses of which tho Rathantara consists, but so repeated by the Hotar as to make three of them, just as the dama singers do. The sabstantive to be supplied to stotriya is pragátha, i.e., that pragátha, which contains the same text as the stotram or performance of the Sama singers. The anurípa pragatha, follows the form of the Stotriya ; it consists of two verses which are made three. It must have the same commencing words as the Stotriya. The anurûpa is : abhi tud pitrvapitaye (8, 3, 7-8). The Dhayyê is already mentioned (3, 22).' The Sama pragatha is : pibi sutasya (8, 8, 1%). The súkta or hymn is mentioned in the following (24) paragraph. 

135 

He repeats the Anurûpa. The Anurûpa is offspring. It is to be repeated with a very loud voice. [200] By doing so, he makes his children more happy than he himself is (for the Stotriya representing his own self, was repeated by him with a half loud voice only.) 

He repeats the Dhảyya. The Dhâyyâ is the wife It is to be repeated with a very low voice. When he who has such a knowledge repeats the Dhâyyâ with a rery low voice, then his wife does not quarrel with him in his house. 

He repeats the (Sâma) Pragatha. It is to be repeated with the proper modulation of the voice (i.e., with the pronunciation of the four accents). ** 

The accents are the animals, the Pragatha are the animals. This is done) for obtaining cattle. 

. He repeats the Sûkta ** (hymu) : jndrasya nu tiryani ( 201 ) (1, 32). This is the hymn liked by Indra, belonging to the Niş kevalya Sastra, and (seen) by Hiranyastápa. By means of this hymu, Hiranyastúpa, the son of Angiras, obtained the favour of Indra (and) gained the highest world. He who has such a knowledge, obtains the favour of India (and) gains the highest paild. The bymn is the house as a firm footing. Thence it is to be repeated with the greatest slowness. (For a firm footing as a resting place is required for every one.) If, for instance, one bappens to have cattle grazing in a distant quarter, he wishes to bring them in the evening) under a shelter. The stables are the firm footing (the place where to put up) for cattle. That is the reason 

« The mantras which form part of the Sastras are nearly throughout monotonously (ekasrutya) repeated. Only in the recital of the Sama pragåtha an exception takes place It is to be repeated with all the four accents: unudatto, arudattatara, udatta, and svaritaijust as is always done when the Rigveda is repeated in the temple, or in private houses, without any religious ceremony being performed. 

4In this hymo, the Nirid of the Nişkevalya Sastra is to be inserted after its eighth verse. The Nivid is as follows:

May the god Indra hear, &c. Sapta häutra. Instead of grai, the sankhayana atras, 7, 17, read harat: which is less correct, and appears to be a mistake.

that this hymn, which represents a firm footing, or shelter for cattle, which was represented by the Pragatha, is to be repeated very slowly, so as to represent a firm footing.

THIRD CHAPTER. (The Abstraction of soina. Origin of the Three Libations. Evening Libation. The Vaišvadeva and Agnimâruta Sastras.) 

25. (Story of the Metres which were despitched by the Gods to fetch the Sona from heaven. Jagati and Tristubh unsuccessful. Origin of Dikga, Tapas, and Dakşind). 

The king Soma lived once) in the other world (in heaven). The Gods and Risis deliberated : how might the king Soma (be induced) to come to us? They said, “Ye metres must bring back to us this king Soma." They consented. They transformed themselves into birds. That they transformed themselves into birds (suparna), and flew up, is called [202] by the knowers of stories sauparnam (1.c, this very story is called so). "The inetres went to fetch the king Soma. They consisted (at that time) of four syllables only; for (at that time) there were only such metres as consisted of four syllables. The Jagati, with her four syllables, flew first up. In flying up, she became tired, after having completed only half the way. She lost three syllables, and being reduced to one syllable, she took (from heaven) with her (only) the Dikşå and Tapas,' and flew back (to the earth). Ile who has cattle is possessed of Dîkşå and pos sessed of Tapas. For cattle belong to Jagati. Jagati took them. 

Then the Triştubh flew up. After having completed more than half the way, she became fatigued, and throwing off one syllable, be came reduced to three syllables, and taking (with her) the Dakşiņai, flew back (to the earth). Thence the Dakşiņıl gifts (sacrificial rewards) are carried away (by the priests) at the midday libation (whiclı is) the place of the Triştubh; for Triştubh alone bad taken them* (the Dakşiņā gifts.) 

26. (Gayatri successful; Wounded when Robbing the Soma. What became of her nail cut off, &c.) 

The gods said to the Gâyatrî, “ Fetch thou the king Soma." She con sented, but said, "During the whole of my journey (up to the celestial 

These gifts are to be bestowed upon the sacrilcer at the Dikya niya işti. See 1,1-5. 

1 The words frezafira are to be parsed as follows: FREEWIFE I a

world), you must repeat the formula for wishing a safe passage for me." The gods consented. She flew up. The gods [208] repeated throughout her passage the formula for wishing a safe passage, viz., pra châ châ, go, and come back, and come back. For the words, pra cha cha, signify, that the whole journey will be made in safety. He who has a friend (who sets out on a journey) ought to repeat this formula ; he then makes his passage in safety, and returns in safety. 

The Gâyatri, when flying up, frightened the guardians of Soma, and seized him with her feet and bill, and (along with him) she also seized the syllables which the two other metres (Jagati and Triştubh) had lost. Krisânu, (one of) the guardians of the Soma, discharged an arrow after her, which cut off the nail of her left leg. This became a porcupine. 

(The porcupine, having thus sprung from the nail which was cut off), the Vasâ (a kind of goat) sprang from the marrot (vasa) which dripped from the nail (cut off). Thence this goat is a (suitable) offering. The shaft of the arrow with the point (discharged by Krisânu) became a serpent which does not bite (dundubha by name). From the vehemence with which the arrow was discharged, the snake sraja was produced ; from the feathers, the shaking branches which haug down the airy roots of the Asvattha) ; from the sinews (with which the feathers vere fastened on the shaft) the worms called gandiipado, from the fulmination (of the steel) the serpent andhahi. Into sucl objects was the arrow of Krišanu; trans formed. 

27. [204] (Origin of the Three Libations. They all are of equal strength.) 

\Vhat Gayatrî had seized with her right foot, that became the morning libation ; she made it her own place. Thence they think the morning libation to be the most auspicious (of all). He who has such a knowledge, becomes the first and most prominent (among his people) and attains to the leadership. 

What she had seized with her left foot, became the midday libation. This (portion) slipped down, and after having slipped down, did not attain to the same (strength) as the first libation (held with the right foot). The gods got aware of it, and wished (that this portion should not be lost). They put (therefore) in it, of the metres, the Triştubh, and of the deities, 

3 This formula is used for wishing to a friend who is setting out on a journey a safe passage and return in safety. 

+ Sayaņa here quotes an Adhvaryu mantra containing the names of the guardians of the Soma, among whom one is Krisânu : 619HHİT ZE GEFa taga a: elhuur fara eta At ar 29, See Vâjasanêyi Bañhitâ, 4, 27, with Mahîdhara's commentary on it (p. 117 in Weber's edition).

Indra. Therefore it (the midday libation) became endowed with the same strength as the first libation. He who has such a knowledge, prospers through both the libations which are of equal strength, and of the same quality. 

What Gayatri had seized with her bill, became the evening libation. When flying down, slie sucked in the juice of this (portion of Soma, held in her bill), and after its juice had gone, it did not equal (in strength) the two first libations. The gods got aware of that and wished (that the juice of this portion should be kept). They discovered it (the reniedy) in cattle. That is the reason that the priests pour sour milk (in the Soma at the evening libation), and bring oblations of melted butter and of flesh (things coming from the cattle). In this way, the evening libation obtain ed equal strength with the two first libations. 

He who has such a knowledge, prospers through all the libations which are of equal strength and of the same quality. 

[205] 28. (How Tristubh and Gayatri obtained their proper 

ozumber of syllables.) The two other metres said to the Gayatri, " That which thou hast obtained of us, viz., our syllables, should be restored to us." The Gayatri answered, "No." (They said) “As far as the right of possession is con cerned, they (those syllables) are ours." They went to ask the gods. The gods said, “ As far as the right of possession is concerned, they are yours.'' Thence it comes, that even here (in affairs of daily life), people say when they quarrel, "as far as the right of possession is concerned, this is 

ours." 

Hence the Gayatrî became possessed of eight syllables (for she did not return the four which she had taken from the others), the Triştubla had three, and the Jagatî only one syllable. 

The Gâyatri lifted the morning libation up (to the gods) ; but the Triştubh was unable to lift up the midday libation. The Gâyatri said to her, "I will go up (with the midday libation) ; let me have a share in it. The Triştubh consented, and said, "Put upon me (who consists of three syllables), these eight syllables." The Gayatri consented, and put upon her (eight syllables). That is the reason that at the midday libation the two last verses of the triplet at the beginning of the Marutvatîya Sastra (the first verse being in the Anuştubb metre), and its sequel 

This remark here is only made to illustrate a phraso which seems to have been vory common in the Vedic Sanskrit : q fare: 

139 

(the arzucharu triplet) belong to the Gayatri. After having obtained thus eleven syllables, she lifted the midday libation up (to heaven). 

The Jagatî which had only one syllable, was unable to lift the third libation (up). The Gâyatrî said [206] to her, “ I will also go up (with thee); let me have a share in this (libation)." The Jagati consented (and said), "Put upon me those eleven syllables (of the Gâyatri and Triştubh joined). She consented and put (those eleven syllables) upon the Jagatî. That is the reason, that, at the evening libation, the two latter verses of the triplet with which the Vaišvadeva Sastra commences (pratipad), and its sequel anuchara) belong to the Gayatri, Jagati, after having obtained twelve syllables, was able to lift the evening libation up (to heaven). Thence it comes that the Gâyatri obtained eight, the Trişțubh eleven, and the Jagatî twelve syllables. 

He who has such a knowledge, prospers through all metres which are of equal strength and of the same quality. What was one, that became three-fold. Thence they say, only be rho has this knowledge, that what was one, became three-fold, should receive presents. 

29. 

(17hy the Adityas and Savitar have a share in the evening libation. On Vâyu's and Dyaváprithivi's share in it.) 

The gods said to the Adityas, “Let us lift up this (the evening) libation through you." They consented. Thence the evening libation commences with the Adityas. At the commencement of it there is (the [207] libation from) the Aditya graha. Its Yâjyî mantra is, adityaso aditir madayantám 17, 51, 2), which contains the term mad, " to be drunk,” which is complete in form (equal to the occasion). For the characteristic feature of the evening libation is, " to be drunk.” He does not repeat the Anuvaşatkâra, nor does he taste the Soma as is usual, after the libation has been poured into the fire); for the Anuvaşat kâra is the completion, and the tasting (of the offering by the priests) is also the completion of the ceremony). The Adityas are the vital airs. (When the Hotar, therefore, does not repeat the Anuvaşatkâra, 

• This remark refers to the fact that the Gayatri, which consisted originally only of eight syllables, consists of three times eight, i.e., twenty-four. 

The very commencement of the evening libation is the pouring of Soma juice from the so-called Âditya graha (a wooden jar). Then follows the chanting of the Arbhavam; then the offering of an animal, and that of Purodása to the manes, after which a libation is poured from the Savitri graha, and the Vaišvadeva sastra repeated. (Âív. Sr. S. 5, 17.) 

e See page 1.33. 

140 

nor taste the Aditya libation, (he thinks), I will certainly put no end to the life (of the sacrificer). 

The Adityas said to Savitar, “let us lift up this (the evening) libation through thee." He consented. Thence the beginning (pratipad of the Vaišvadeva Sastra at the evening libation) is made with a triplet of verses addressed to Savitar." To the Vaisvadeva Sastra belongs the Savitri graha. Before?? the commencement (of this Sastra) he repeats the Yajya for the libation (from the Savitri graha), damuna devaḥ savitâ varenyam (Âøv. Sr. S. 5, 18). This versela contains [208] the term mad “ to be drunk" which is complete in form. The term mad" to be druuk” is a characteristic of the evening libation. He does not repeat the Anuvaşatkâra, nor does he taste (from the Soma juice in the Savitri graha). For the Anuvaşatkâra is completion, the tasting (of the Soma by the priest) is completion. Savitar is the life. (He should do neither, thinking) I will certainly put no end to the life of the sacrificer). Savitar drinks largely from both the morning and evening libations. For there is the term piba, " drink," at the commencement 13 of the Nivid addressed to Savitar at the 

9 The negation is here expressed by net, i.C., na it, the same word, which is almost exclusively used in the Zend-Avesta, in the form noita, for expressing the simple negative. 

10 The Pratipad, or beginning triplet of verses of the Vaišvadeva sastra is : stat savitur urinimahe (5, 82, 1-3). 

11 The Yajyâ is to be repeated before the Vaišvadeva Sastra is repeated, 

12 It is also, with some deviations, found in the Atharvaveda Samhita (7, 14, 4). According to the Âsy. Sutras, it runs as follows: 

दमूना देवः सविता वरेण्यो दधद्रत्ना दक्षपितृभ्यो श्रायुनि.। पिवात्सोमं ममदन्नेन मिष्टयः ORSA fogad a TFT W The deviations of the text in the Atharvaveda consist in the following: instead of TEL: a, for fo: anio; for parraqueq: it has AHTasa: ; instead of ma, it has an. It is evident that the readings of the Athar vaveda are corrupt; for it will be impossible to make out the sense of the mantra from its text presented in the Atharyaveda : but it nay be done from that one given in the Âóvalâyana Sutras. I translate it as follows : « The divine house-father Savitar, who is chosen (as tutelary deity by men), has provided people (ayu) with precious gifts to make offerings to Dakşa (one of the Adityas) and the manes. May he drink the Soma! May the (Soma) offerings inebriate hin, when on his wanderings, he pleases to delight in his (the Soma's) quality !" 

13 In the words, savitâ devah somasya prbatu. The hymn, in which the Nivid for Savitar is inserted, is, abhtid dezak savita (4, 54). The whole Nivid is as follows : 

सविता देवः सोमस्य पिबतु । हिरण्यपाणिः सुजिहवः । सुबाहुः स्वंगुरिः । त्रिरहन्त्सत्यसवनः । य: प्रासुवद्वसुधितो । उभे जोत्री सवोमनि । श्रेष्ठ सावित्रमासुवं । दोग्ध्रीं धेनु । वोलहारमनड़वाह । आशु सतिं । पुरंधि योषां । जिष्णु रथेष्टा । सभेयं युवानं । परामीवां साविपत्परायशंसं । सविता देव 

safe hraFT FAT I SAT ato (The conclusion is just as in the other Nivids). Sapta Hâutra. In the Sânkhay. Sr. Satras (8, 18), there are, before Afto the words : 

141 

[209] evening libation), and at the end 14 the term mad, " to be drunk.” Thus he makes Savitar share in both the morning and evening libations. 

At the morning and evening libations, verses addressed to Vayu are repeated, pany at the morning, one only's at the evening, libation. That is done because the vital airs (represented by Vayu, the wind) in the upper parts (represented by the morning libation) of the human body are inore numerous than those in the lower parts (represented by the evening libation). 

He repeats a hymn addressed to Heaven and Earth.16 For Heaven and Earth are stand-points. [210] Earth is the stand-point here, and Heaven is the stand-point there (in the other world). By thus repeating a hymn addressed to Heaven and Earth, the Hotar establishes the sacrificer in both places (in earth and heaven). 

30. (Story of the Ribhus. On their Share in the Evening Lilation.) 

He repeats the Ribhu hymn (takşan ratham, 1, 111).17 The (beings praar a : I translate it as follows : May the god Savitar drink of the Soma juice he with his golden hands and his good tongue, with his fine arms and ine fingers, he who produces thrice a day the real objects (ie., the external world is visible in the morning, at noon, and in the evening), he who produced the two treasures of wealth, the two loving sisters (night and dawn), the best things that are created, the milking cow, the ox-drawing cart, the swift septad (of horses for drawing the carriage of the sun-god), the female (called) purandhi, ie, meditation, the victorious warrior, the youth in the assemblage (of men), &c. 

In the words, savitci devah itu śravad iha somasya matsat. 

10 This renark refers to the last words which are appended to the Nivid hymn for Savitar, viz., riyudblir viyavilla. The whole appendage, which is to be found in the Âsv. Sr. S. 5, 18, and in Sapta Kautra is : *41 * f* 1 TACO farnais farcits Teh fagara i faggaigras ar gaiz, i.e., Viya, come hither with (thy) steeds, unloosen them, (come) with eleven for thy own sake, with twenty-two for making) the sacrifice om ! with thirty-three for carrying (the sacrifice) 

10 This is pradyává yajnáin (1, 159). The Nivid to be inserted before the lost verse of the Dyavâpritbivî hymn is : 

धावापृथिवी सोमस्य मत्सता । पिता च माता च पुत्रश्च प्रजननं च । धेनुश्च ऋषमश्च । धन्या च धिषणा च । सुरेताश्च सुदुघा च । शंभूच मयोभूश्च । ऊर्जस्वती च । पयस्वतीच रेतोधाश्च रेतो भिश्च । द्याचा पृथिवी इह श्रुतामिह सोमस्य मत्सतां । प्रेमा देवी देवहूतिमवतां देव्या घिया। प्रेदं ब्रह्म प्रेदं क्षत्रं । प्रेदं सुन्वन्तं यजमानमवतां । चित्रे चित्राभिरूतिभिः । श्रुतां ब्रह्माण्यावसागai May Heaven and Earth enjoy the Soma which are the father and mother, the son and generation, the cow and the bull, the grain and the wood, the well-provided with seed, and the well-pro vided with milk, the happy and the beneficial, the juicy and milky, the giver of seed, and (holder) of seed. May both Heaven and Earth here hear (me)! May they here enjoy the Soma, &c. 

17 The Nivid inserted before the last verse of the Ribhu hymn is : 

ऋभवो देवाः सोमस्य मत्सन । विष्ट्रवी स्वपसः । कर्मण सुहस्ताः । धन्या धनिष्ठाः । शग्या142 

called) Ribhus among the gods, had, by means of austerities, obtained the right to a share in the Soma beverage. They (the gods) wished to make room for them in the recitations at the morning libation ; but Agni with the Vasus (to whom this libation belongs), turned them out of the morning libation. They (the gods) then wished to make room for them in the recitations at the midday libation; but Indra with the Rudras (to whom this libation belongs), turned them out of this libation. They then wished to make room for them in the [211] recitations at the evening libation ; but the Viéve Devâh (to whom it be longs), tried to turn them out of it, saying, “ They shall not drink here ; they shall not." Prajâpati then said to Savitar, “ These are thy pupils; thou alone (among the Visve Devâh), therefore, shalt drink with them." He consented, and said (to Prajâpati), “ Drink thou also, standing on both sides of the Ribhus. ” Prajapati drank standing on both sides of them. (That is the reason that) these two Dhûyyâs (required for the Vaišvadeva Sastra) which do not contain the name of any particular deity, and belong to Prajapati, are repeated, one before the other, after the Ribhu hymn. (They are) surtipakrtizzril útaye (1, 4, 1) and ayam venas chodayat (10, 123, 1).15 Prajâ pati thus drinks on both their sides. Thus it comes that a chief 'śreşthi) favours with a draught from his goblet whom he likes. 

The gods, however, abhorred them (the Ribhus), on account of their human'' smell. (Therefore) they placed two (other) Dhâyy is between the Ribhus and themselves. (These are) yebhyo mita mådłumal (10,63 3), and eva pitre visva devâya (4, 50, 6).90

May the divine Ribhus enjoy the Soma, who are busy and clover, who are skilfal with their hands, who are very richi, who are full of bliss, full of strength, who cut the cow which moves everywhere, and has all forms (i.e, the earth), who cut the cow (that) she became of all forms, who yoked the two yellow horses of Indra) who weat to the gods, who when eating got aware of the girls, who entered by their skill upon their share in the sacrifice in the year (at the sacrificial session lasting for one year); may the divine Ribhus hear (us) here and enjoy the Soma, &c. 

16 This whole story is invented for explaining the position assigned to certain verses and hymes in the Vaišvadeva sastra. After the hymn addressed to Savitar, ablúd deval savitii (4, 54), there follows the verso suripakritnum, which is called a Dhayyü; then comes the hymn addressed to the Ribhus, talesan ratlan, and then the verse ayam venas, which is also a Dháyyá. See Âšv, Sr. S, 5, 8.

He repeats the Vaišvadeva hymn."1 The Vaišvadeva Sastra shows the relationship of subjects (to theii king) Just as people represent the interior part [213] (of a kingdom), so do also the bymns (represent the interior, the kernel, of the Sastra).

मा वो देवा अपिशलामापरिशसावृक्षि। विश्वे देवा इह श्रवलिह सोमस्य मत्सन् । प्रेमां देवा (Sapta Hâutra). The text as given in the Sankhaya. Ar. 6. 8,21, differs in several pas sages. Instead of 713 o it has TOTO which is, no doubt, more correct. The words arara ser parat foago are transposed; they follow after aratai:, after which ताभिषe and ताव० रा. are put. Instead of अपिशस०, there is श्रविशासामाविशसा पुरा वनि 

The translation of some terms in this Nivid, which is doubtless very old, is extremely difficult. Now and then the reading does not appear to be correct. It is, however, highly interesting, as perbaps one of the most ancient accounts we have of the number of Hindu deities. They are here stated at 3 times 11; then at 33, then at 303. then at 3003. It appears from this statement, that only the number 3 remained unchanged, whilst the number 30 was maltiplied by 10 or 100. Similarly, the number of gods is stated at 3339 in a hymo ascribed to the Rişi Vistâbitra Rigveda, 3, 9, 9 This statement appears to rely on the Vaišvadeva Nivid. For, if we add 3373034-3003 together, we obtain exactly the number 3:39. This coincidence can hardly be fortuitous, and we have strong reasons to believe that Visvamitra perfectly knew this Viśve Devâh Nivid. That it contains one of the most authoritative passages for fixing the number of Hindu deities follows fron quotations in other Vedic books. So we road in the Brihad Arauyaka Upanishad (page 642-49, edited by Roex Calcutta, 1849) a discussion by Yâjñavalkya on the number of gods, where he appeals to tho Nivid of the Vaiávadeva hymn as the most authoritative passage for settling this question. Perhaps the oldest authority we have for fixing the number of the Hindu deities, on the first instance, at thirty-three, is Rigveda, 8, 28, 1. The hymn to which this verse belongs is said to have descended from Manu, the progenitor of the human race. Its style shows traces of high antiquity, and there can be hardly any doubt, that it is one of the carliest Vedic hymns we have. The division of these thirty-three deities into three gets, each of eleven, equally distributed among the three worlds, heaven, air, and earth, (sce 1, 139, 11) appears to be the result of later speculations. According to the Nivid in question, the gods are not distributed among the three worlds, but they are in heaven and earth, water, and sky, in the Brahma and Kşatra, in the Barbis, and on the Vedi, in the sacrifice, and in the air, 

144 

considered as a separate recitation distinct from the body of the Sastra). (Some one might object) how can verses, like the Dhâyyâs, which are life, be compared to a desert ? Regarding this, he (the Aitareya Rişi) has told that the deserts (aranyâni) are properly speaking no deserts, on account of the deer and birds to be found there. 

The Vaišvadeva Sastra is to be likened to man. Its hymns are like his internal parts ; its Dhâyyàs are like the links (of his body). That is the reason that the Hotar calls sorisâ rom before and after every Dhảyyâ (to represent motion and flexibility). For the links of the human body are loose; these are, however, fastened and held together by the Brahma. The Dhảyya*; and Yâjyâ verses are the root of the [214] sacrifice. When they use Dhâyyâs and Yajyós different from those which are prescribed, then they uproot the sacrifice. Therefore, they (the Dhảyyâs and Yâjyâs) should be only of the same nature (they should not use other ones than those mentioned). 

The Vaišvadeva Sastra belongs to five classes of beings. It belungs to all five classes of beings, viz.. Gods and Men, Gandharvas (and) Apsaras, *** Serpents and Manes. To all these five classes of beings belongs the Vaišvadeva Sastra. All beings of these five classes know him (the Hotar who repeats the Vaišvadeva Sastra). To that Hotar who has suclı a knowledge come those individuals of these sive classes of beings wlio understand the art of recitation (to assist him). The Hotar who repeats the Vaišvadeva Sastra belongs to all deities. When he is about to repeat his Sastra, lie ought to think of all directious (have them before his mind), by which incans he provides all these directions with liquid (rasa). But he ought not to thiuk of that direction in which his enemy lives. By doing so, he consequently deprives him of his strength, ! He concludes (the Vaišvadeva Sastra) with the verse aditur dyâur aditir antarikşam (1, 89, 10), ie, Aditi is heaven, Aditi is the air, Aditi is mother, father and son ; Aditi is all gods; Aditi is the five classes of creatures; Aditi is what is born ; Aditi is what is to be born." She (Aditi) is inother, she is father, she is son. In her are the Vaisvadevas, in her the five classes of creatures. She is what is born, she is what is to be born. 

(When reciting this concluding verse which is to be repeated thrice), he recites it twice (for the second and third times) so as to stop at each (of the four) padas. (He does so) for obtaining cattle, which are 

23 Here the regular Dhayyâs (see 3, 18), aro to be understood, not those extraordinary additions which we havo in tho Vaišvadeva Éastra. 

23 Gandharvas and Apsaras are counted as onc class only. 

145 

[215] four-footed. Once (the first time) he repeats the concluding verse, stopping at the end of each half of the verse only. (That is done) for establishing a firm footing. Man has two feet, but animals have four. (By repeating the concluding verse twice in the said manner) the Hotar places the two-legged sacrificer among the four-legged animals. 

He ought always to conclude (the Vaisvadeva Sastra) with a verse addressed to the five classes of beings (as is the case in aditir dykur); and, when concluding, touch the earth. Thus he finally esta blishes the sacrifice in the same place in which he acquires the means of his performance. 

After having repeated the Vaisvadeva Sastra, he recites the Yajyâ verse addressed to the Vißve Davâs : višve devaḥ śpinuta imam havam me (6, 52, 13). Thus he pleases the deities according to their shares (in the libation). 

82 (The Oferings of Ghee to Agni and Vişnu, and the Offering 

of a Charu to Soma.) The first Yajyâ verse for the offering of hot butter is addressed to Agni, that for the offering of Charu is addressed to Soma, and another for the offering of hot butter is addressed to Vişnu.24 . 

[216] The Yâjyâ verse for the offering of Charu to Soma is tvam soma pitrivhih (8, 48, 13); it contains the word "pitaras," z.e., manes. (This Charu is an oblation to the dead Soma). The priests kill the Soma, when they extract its juice. This (oblation of Charu) is therefore the cow which they use to kill (when the body of a sacrificer is laid on the funeral pile 25) For this Charu oblation has, for the Soma 

2* After the Soma juice has been offered to the Visvedevâs, an offering of hot batter (ghee) is given to Agni ; then follows the oblation of Chara or boiled rice to Soma, and then another oblation of bot butter to Vişno. The chief oblation is that of Chart to Sewa, which is prot in the midst of the two offerings of hot butter. The Yâjy verses addressed at this occasion to Agni and Vişna are not to be found in the Sanhita of the Rigveda ; but they are given by Âsval. in the srauta Sätras, (, 19). The following is addressed to Agni: argaar te sig afara garatu ZA I T at Enak ako 

ga faqatge gart, 1.0, Agni is it who receives oblations of hot battes, who has (as it were) 2 back laden with hot batter, by whom bot botter abides, whose pery house is hot batter. May tby butter drops, sputtering horses, carry theel Thoa, Q God I offerest up the sacrifice to the gods, by drinking the hot batter. 

The Yâjyâ verse addressed to Vişnu is : 9€ fa Kur fagnatagpo a 

T af faa y a fafar, .P., take, O Vişnu ! thy wide strides; make us room for living in case. Drink the bot butter, O thon, who art the womb of hot butter; prolong (the life of) the master of the sacrifice (the sacrificer), 

24 The term is anustarani (pauh), i.e., a cow put down after, 1.accompanying the dond to the other world. Soe Åsv. Grihya Satra, 4, 8. 

146 

the same significance as the cow sacrificed at the funeral pile for the manes. This is the reason that the Hotar repeats (at this occasion) a Yâjyå verse, containing the term "pitaras," i.e., manes. Those who have extracted the Soma juice, have killed the Soma. (By making this oblation) they produce him anew. 

They make him fat 28 in the form of a siege (by putting him between Agni and Vişnu); for (the order [217] of) the deities Agni, Soma, and Vişnu, has the form of a siege. 

After having received (from the Adhvaryu) the Oharu for Soma for being eaten by him, the Hotar should first look at himself and then (offer it) to the Sâma singers. Some Hotri-priests offer first this Charu (after the oblation to the gods is over) to the Sama singers. But he ought not to do that ; for he (the Hotar) who pronounces the (powerful) call vauşat, eats all the remains of the food (offered to the gods). So it has been said by him (the Aitareya şişi). Therefore, the Hotar who pronounces the (powerful) formula vauşat should, when acting upon that injunction (to offer first the Charu remains to the Sâma singers), certainly first look upon himself. Afterwards the Hotar offers it to the Såma singers."? 

83. (Prajapati's Illegal Intercourse with his Daughter, and the Conse quences of it. The Origin of Bhútavan.) 

Prajâpati thougnt of cohabiting with his own daughter, whom some call "Heaven," others "Dawn," (Uşas). He transformed himself into a buck or a kind of deer (risya), whilst his daughter assumed the shape of 

** The term is apyayanti. This is generally done by sprinkling water over him before the Juioe is squeezed, for the purpose of making the Soma (mystically) grow. When he is already squeezed and even sacrificed, water itself cannot be sprinkled over him. But this is mystically done, by addressing the verses just mentioned to the deities Agni, Soma, and Vişgu, so as to pat Soma in the midst of them, just as a town invested on all sides. When they perform the ceremony of apyayanam, the Soma plant Is on all sides to be sprinkled with water. This is done here symbolically by offering first ghee, and giving ghee again after the Charu for Soma is sacrificed. So he is Burrounded everywhere by ghee, and the two gods, Agni and Vişnu, 

The remark about the apyáyanam is made in the Brāhmaṇam for the sole purpose of accounting for the fact, that the first Yajya is addressed to Agni, the second to Soma, and the third to Visņu ; that this was a sacrificial rule, see Âsv. Śr. $. 5, 19. 

,37 The mantras which the Hotar has to repeat at this occasion, are given in full by Ašvaldyana Sr. 8. 5. 19. After having repeated them, he besmears his eyes with melted butters and gives the Chara, over which butter ia dripped, to the sina singers, who are called here and in Abvaldyana Chandanas

female deer (rohit). ** He approached her. [218] The gods saw it (crying), " Prajapati commits an act never done (before).” (In order to avert the evil consequences of this incestuous act) the gods inquired for some one who might destroy the evil consequences (of it). Among themselves they did not find any one who might do that (atone for Prajapati's crime). They then put the most fearful bodies (for the gods have many bodies) of theirs in one. This aggregate of the most fearful bodies of the gods became & god, Bhútavân, aby name. For he who knows this name only, is born.*The gods said to him, "Prajapati has committed an act which he ought not to have committed. Pierce this : 2 (the incarnation of his evil deed)." So he did. He then said, "I will choose a boon from you.”—They said, "Choose.” He then chose as his boon sovereignty over cattle.88 That is the reason that his name is pašumán), i.e., having cattle. He who knows on this earth only this name (pašumân), becomes rich in cattle. 

He (Bhâtavân) attacked him (the incarnation of Prajâpati's evil deed) and pierced him (with an arrow). After having pierced him; he sprang up (and became a constellation). They call him mriga, isen, deer (stars in the Orion), and him who killed that being** (which (219) sprang from Prajapati's misdeeds), mriga vyâdha, ie., hunter of the deer (name of star). The female deer Rohit (into which Prajâpati's daughter had been transformed) became the constellation) Rohiņi. 

** Sayapa gives another explanation. He takes rohitam, not as the name of a female deer, but as an adjective, meaning red. But then we had to expeot rohitan The crade form is rohit, not rohita. He explains the supposed rohita as ritumati. 

* Sây. takes him as Rudra, which is, no doubt, correct. 

\# This is only an explanation of the term bhútaván.. . This refers to the papman, i.e., the incarnate evil deeds, a kind of devil The evil deed of Prajapati had assumed a certain form, and this phantom, which is nothing but # personification of remorse, was to be destroyed. 

** This appears to confirm Sâyapa's opinion that Rudra or Siva is hore alluded to. For he is called pasu pati, master of cattle. 

* Sày. refers the demonstrative pronouns tam imam, by which alone the incar nation of Prjå pati's eyil deed is here indicated, to Prajapati himself, who had assumed the shape of a buck. But the idea that Prajapati was killed (even in the shape ot a buck) is utterly inconsistent with the Vedio notions about him : for in the older parts of the Vedas he appears as the Supreme Being, to whom all are subject. The noun to be supplied was papman. But the author of the Brahmanam abhorred the idea of a påpman or incarnation of sin of Prajâpati, the Lord of the Universe, the Creator. Thence he was only hinted at by this demonstrative pronoun. The mentioning of the word påpman in connection with Prajapati, was, no doubt, regarded by the author, as very in auspicious. Even the incestuous act committed by Prajapati, he does not call pápa, sin, ordoga, fault, but only akritam, " what ought not to be done,' whioh is the very mildent torm by which a orime can be mentioned. 

148 

The arrow (by which the phantom of Prajâ pati's sin was pierced) which had three parts (shaft, steel, and point) became such an arrow in the sky). The sperm which had been poured forth from Prajapati, flew down on the earth and became a lake. The gods said, “May this sperm of Prajapati not be spoilt (máduşat).” This became tbe maduşam. This name mâduşa is the same as manuşa, i.e., man. For the word mânusa. j.e., man, means “one who should not be spoiled” (mâduşan). This (måduşa) is a commonly) unknown word. For the gods like to express themselves in such terms unkown (to men). 

84, (How Different Creatures Originated from Prajapati's Sperm. On the Verse addressed to Rudra. Propitiation of Rudra.) 

The gods surrounded this sperm with Agni (in order to make it flow); the Marutas agitated it; but Agni did not make it (the pool formed of Prajapati's sperm) move. They (then) surrounded it with Agni Vaiśm vânara ; the Marutas agitated it; Agni- Vaišvânara (then) made it move. That spark which first blazed up from Prajapati's sperm became that Aditya (the [220] sun); the second which blazed up became Bhrigu. Varuna adopted him as his son. Thence Bhrigu is called Varuni, i.e., descendant of Varuņa. The third which blazed up (adidevata) ** became the Adityas (a class of gods). Those parts (of Prajapati's seed after it was heated) which were coals (angâra) becane the Angigas. Those coals whose fire was not extinguished, and which blazed up again, became Brihaspati. Those parts which remained as coal dust (parikşândni) became black animals, and the earth burut red (by the fire), became red animals. The ashes which remained became a being full of links, which went in all directions (and sent forth) a stag, buffalo, antelope, camel, ass, and wild beasts. 

This god (the Bhûtavan), addressed them (these animals), “This is mine; mine is what was left on the place." They made him resign hiş sbare by the verse which is addressed to Rudra : & te pitâ marutám (2, 33, 1), i.e., "may it please thee, father of the Marutas, not to cut us off from beholding the sun (i.e., from living); may'st thou, powerful hero (Rudra)! spare our cattle and children, that we, O master of the Rudras !" might be propagated by our progeny." : The Hotar ought to repeat (in the third pada of the verse) tvam no viro and not abhi no viro (as is the reading of another Sakhâ). For, if he do not repeat the words abhi nah, i, e., towards us, then this god 

5. This strange intensive form of the root div, to shine, is here chosen only for ex plaining the origin of the namo, "adityar." 

149 (Rudra) does not entertain any designs against (abhi) our children and cattle (i.e.) he does not kill them. In the fourth half-verse be ought to use the word rudriya, instead of rudra, for diminishing the terror (and danger) arising from the pronunciation of) the real name Rudra.S * 

[221] (But should this verse appear to be too dangerous) the Hotar may onit it and repeat (instead of it) only sam nah karati (1, 43, 6), i.e., "may he be propitiated (and) let our horses, rams and ewes, our males and females, and cows go on well." (By repeating this verse) he commences with the word śam, i.e., propitiated, which serves for general propitiation. Narah (in the verse mentioned) means males, and nåryah females. 

(That the latter verse and not the first one should be repeated, may be shown from another reason.) The deity is not mentioned with its name, though it is addressed to Rudra, and contains the propitiatory term śam. (This verse helps) to obtain the full term of life (100 years). He who has such a knowledge, obtains the full term of his life. This verse (sam nah karati) is in the Gâyatri metre. Gayatri is Brahma. By repeating that verse, tbe Hotar worships him (Rudra) by means of Brahma (and averts consequently all evil consequences which arise from using a verse referring to Rudra). 

85. (The Vaisvanara and Maruta Nivid Hymns, and the Stotriya and Anurûpa of the Agnimâruta Sastra.) 

The Hotar commences the Agni-mâruta Sastra with a hymn addressed to Agni-Vaišvânara.38 [222] Vaisvânara is the seed which 

36 In the Rigveda Samhitâ which is extant at present, the mantra has in the third pada the word abhi tło, and not tvam no, and in the fourth pada rudra, and not rudriya. The readings of the verse as they are in our copies of the Sawbita, seem to have been current already at the time of the author of the Aitareya Brahmanam. But he objects to using the verse so, as it was handed down, for sacrificial purposes, on account of the danger which might arise from the use of such terms as abhi, i.e. (turned) towards, and rudra, the proper name of the fearful god of destruction. He proposes two things, either to change these dangerous terms, or to leave out the verse altogether, and use another one instead of it. 

t« This is vaišuânaráya prithu (3, 3). The Nivid for the Vaišvâpara hymn is : 

अग्निवैश्वानरः सोमस्य मत्सत् । विश्वेषां देवानां समित् । अजस्त्र दैव्यं ज्योतिः। यो विडम्यो Algiz etag i og gafe fuara: 1 2 3 1 91 E Herat i तरितं । ज्योतिषा यज्ञाय शर्म यंसत् । अग्निवैश्वानर इह प्रवदिह सोमस्य मत्सत् । प्रेमा देवो देवहूति 

“May Agni Vaisvånara enjoy the Soma, he who is the fuel for all gods (for he as the vital spirit keeps thom up), he who is the imperishable divine light, who lighted to the quarters of men, who (was) shining in former skies (days), who is never-decaying in the

was poured forth. Thence the Hotar commences the Agni-miruta Sastra with a hymn addressed to Vaisvânara. The first verse is to be repeated without stopping. He who repeats the Agni-mâruta Sastra, extinguishes the fearful flames of the fires. By (suppressing) his breath (when repeating the first verse) he crosses the fires. Lest he might (possibly) forego some sound (of the mantra) when repeating it, it is desirable that he should appoint some one to correct such a mistake (which might arise). By thus making him (the other man) the bridge, he crosses (the fires, even if he should commit some mistake in repeating). Because of no mistake in repeating being allowed in this, there ought to be some one appointed to correct the mistakes, when the Hotar repeats it, 

The Marutas are the sperm which was poured forth. By shaking it they made it flow. Thence he repeats a hymn addressed to the Marutas.? 

[223] In the midst (of the Sastra, after having repeated the two hymns mentioned) he repeats the Stotriya's and Anurûpa Pragathas, yajnd yajnâ vo agnaye (1, 168, 1-2), and devo vo dravinoda (7, 16, 11-12). The reason, that he repeats the "womb" (the Stotriya) in the midst (of the Sastra), is because women have their wombs in the middle (of their bodies). By repeating it, after having already recited two hymns (the Vaisvanara and Agni-mâruta), he puts the organ of generation between the two legs in their upper part for producing offspring. He who has such a knowledge will be blessed with offspring and cattle. 

course of the auroras (during all days to come), who illumines the sky, the earth, and the wide airy region. May ho, through his light, give (us) shelter! May Agni Vaišvânar2 here hear (as), &c." 

? This is the sakta : pratvalegasah pratava sah (1, 87). The Nivid of the hymn for the Marutas at the evening libation, is : 

महतो देवाः सोमस्थ मत्सन् । सुष्टुभः स्वकोः । अर्कस्तुभो बहद्वयसः । सूरा अनाष्टरथी । स्वेषासः पृश्निमातरः। शुभ्राहि-रण्यरवाइप : तव सो भददिष्टयः : । नमस्यावर्ष निमिज मरतो देवा इह अवनिह सोमस्य मत्सन् । प्रेमा देवा देवहूतिमबंतु . 

** May the divine Marutas enjoy the Soma, who chant well and have fine songs, who chant their songs, who have large stores (of wealth), who have good gifts, and whose chariots are irresistible, who are glittering, the sons of Priśni, whose armonr shines with the brilliancy of gold, who are powerful, who receive the offerings (to carry them up), who make the clouds drop the rain. May the divine Maratas bear (my invocation). May 

they enjoy the Soma, &c." 

* The Stotriya is here mentioned by the term of yoni, womb. It is called so on account of its containing the very words of the Saman in whose praise the whole Sastra is recited, and forming thus the centre of the whole recitation. The name of the Sinan in question is yajua yajniya (Samaveda Sapi bita, %, 58, 60.)

86. 

(The Jätaredas Nivid Hymn). He repeats the hymn addressed to Jâtavedâs.86 All beings, after having been created by Prajâpati [224], walked, having their faces turned aside, and did not turn (their backs). He (Prajapati) then encircle them with fire, whereupon they turned to Agni. After they had turned to Agni, Prajapati said, “ The creatures which are born (jata), I obtained (avidam) through this one (Agpi).” From these words came forth: the Jâtavedâs hymn. That is the reason that Agni is called Jåta vedås. * 

WWWWWWW 

The creatures being encircled by fire, were hemmed in walking. They stood in flames and blazing. Prajapati sprinkled them with water. That is the reason that the Hotar, after having recited the Jâtavedâs hymn, repeats a hymn addressed to the waters : đpô hiştha mayobhurah (10,9). Thence it is to be recited by him as if he were extinguishing fire (i.e., slowly). 

Prajapati, after having sprinkled the creatures with water, thought that they (the creatures) were his own. He provided them with an invisible lustre, through Ahir budhnya. This Ahir budhnya (lit., the serpent of the depth) is the Agni Gârbapatya (the household fire). By repeating therefore a verse addressed to Ahir bundhnya, *' the Hotar 

3* This is : pra tavyasim, 1, 143. The Nivid for Jätavedas is: 

अग्निर्जातवेदाः सोमस्य मत्सत् । स्वनीकश्चित्रभानु: । अपोषिवान्गृहपतिः। तिरस्तमांसि दर्शतः । घताहवन ईड्यः । बहुलवर्मास्तृत यम्वा प्रतीत्या शत्रून्जेतापराजितः । अग्ने जातवेदोऽभिद्युन्नमभिसह प्रायछस्त्र । तुशोप्रप्तुशः । समेद्वारं स्तोतारमहसस्पाहि । अग्निर्जातवेदा इह अवदिह सोमस्य मत्सत् । प्रेमा देवो देव हूतिमवतु . 

“May Agni Jåtavedås enjoy the Soma! he who has a beautiful appearance, whose splendour is apparent to all, he, the house-father, who does not iicker (when burning, 1.e., whose fire is great and strong), he who is visible amidst the darkness, he who receives the offerings of melted butter, who is to be praised, who performs the sacrifices without being disturbed by many hindrances, who is unconquerable and conquers his enemies in the battle. O Agni Jatavedås i extend (thy) splendoor and strength round 

· us, with force and pluck (tušah and aptuśaḥ are adverbs); protect him who lights (thee), and praises (thee) from distress! May Agni Jatavedas here hear (us): may he enjoy the Soma. 

40 The etymology of the word as here given is fanciful. The proper meaning of the word is, "having possession of all that is born," i.l., pervading it. With the idea of the fire being an all-pervading power, the Rişis are quite familiar. By játavedas the *animal fre" is particularly to be understood. 

42 This is uta no ahir budhnyaḥ śrinotu (6, 50, 14), which forms part of the Agni marata sastra.. See Âbv. fr8, 6, 20..puts the invisible lustre in the [225] offspring (of the sacrificer). Thence they say, “One who brings oblations is more shining than one who does not bring them." 49 

37. (The Offerings to the Wives of the Gods and to Yama and the Kavyas, a Class of Munes.) 

After having addressed in the Alir budhnya verse) Agai, the house father, he recites the verses addressed to the wives of the gods. ** For the wife (of the sacrificer) sits behind the Gârbapatya fire. 

They say: he should first address Raka ** with a verse, for the honour of drinking first from the Soma belongs (among the divine women) to the sister of the gods). But this precept should not be cared for. He should first address the wives of the gods. By doing so, Agni, the house-father, provides the wives with seed. By means of the Gârhapatya, Agni, the Hotar thus actually provides the wives with seed for production. He who has such a knowledge will be blessed with offspring (and) cattle. (That the wives have precedence of a sister is apparent in worldly things.) For a sister who has come from the same womb is provided with food, &c., after the wife, who has come from another womb, has been cared for. 

He repeats the Râkâ verse. 48 She sews that seam (in the womb) which is on the penis, so as to form a man. He who has such a knowledge obtains male children. 

(226) He repeats the Paviraví verse. Speech is Sarasvati påvirava. By repeating this verse, he provides the sacrificer with speech. 

They ask, Should he first repeat the verse addressed to Yama, or that one which is devoted to the Manes ? 47 He should first repeat the verse addressed to Yama : imam yama prastara (10, 14, 4). For a king (Yama being a ruler) has the honour of drinking first. 

Immediately after it, he repeate the verse for the Kavyas : mdtali kavyair yamo (10, 14, 3). The Kâvyas are beings inferior to the gods, 'and superior to the manes. Thence be repeats the verses for the manes, udiratám avara utparásaḥ (10, 15, 1-3), after that one addressed to the Kâvyas. By the words of the first verse), “ May the Somna-loving 

** This, no doubt, refers to the so-called Agni-hotsis, to whom daily oblations to the fire, in the morning and evening, are enjoined. 

*** These are two in number, devá nám patnir usatir uvuntu (5, 46, 7, 8). 

441 See the note to 7, 11. * This is råkám aham, 2, 32, 4. ** Påviravi ķanya, 6, 49, 7. * This is udiratâm avara utparásah (10, 15, 1).

manes who are of low as well as those who are of a middling and supe rior character, rise," he pleases them all, the lowest as well the middling and highest ones, without foregoing any one. In the second verse, the term barhisado, "sitting on the sacred grass,” implies, that they have a beloved house. By repeating it, he makes them ** prosper through their beloved house. He who has such a knowledge prospers through his beloved house. The verse (out of three) which contains the term "adoration," "this adoration be to the manes," he repeats at the end (though it be second in order). That is the reason, that at the end of funeral ceremonies), the manes are adored (by the words) "adoration to you, O manes !" 

They ask, Should he, when repeating the verses to the manes, use at oach verse the call somsåvom, or [227] should be repeat them without that call ? He should repeat it. What ceremony is not finished in the Pitri yajña (offering to the manes), that is to be completed. The Hotar who repeats the call somsävom at each verse, completes the incomplete sacrifice. Thence the call somsåvom ought to be repeated. 

38. On Indra's Share in the Evening Libation. On the Verses Addressed to Vişnu and Varuna, to Vişnu alone, and to Prajapati. The Concluding Verse and the Yâjya of the Agnimdruta Sastra.) 

The Hotar repeats the anu-pâniya verses addressed to Indra and his drinking of the Soma juice after (the other deities have been satisfied), sodduş kildyam madhuman (6, 47, 1-4). By their means, Indra drank from the Soma after the third libation (anupibat). Thence the verses are called anu-paniyat, "referring to drinking after." The deities are drunk, as it were, at this (third libation) when the Hotar repeats those verses. Thence has the Adhvaryu, when they are repeated, to respond to the Hotar (when calling somsåvom) with a word derived from the root mad, "to be drunk."49 

He repeats a verse referring to Vişnu and Varuna, yayor ojasâ. * * ** The MSS have gair, instead of Bata (acc. pl.), as Sây. reads in his Commentary. 

** This refers to the two phrases, madáno deva, "we are drunk, o God !" and modamo daivom, " we rejoice, O divine ! Om!" which are the responses of the Adhvaryu to the Hotar's call somsávom in the midst of the four Åna-pânîya verses abovementioned. See Åsv. Śr. S. 5, 20. The usual response of the Adhvarya to the Patar's ahava, sorsávom, is Somsámo daivom, see Âśv. Sr, 8.5, 9. 

** It is not found in the Samhita of the Rigveda, but in the Aby. br. 8. 5. 20, and in the Atharvaveda, S. 7, 25, 1. Both texts differ a little. Åsvaldyana reads: 

अयोराजसा स्कभिता रजांसि वीर्येभिर्वीरतमा शविष्ठया पस्येते अप्रतीता सहोमि विष्ण भगब IT

154 

Vişnu protects the defects in the [228] sacrificos (from producing any evil consequences) and Varuna protects the fruits arising from its success ful performance. (This verse is repeated) to propitiate both of them. 

He repeats a verse addressed to Visņu: vişnor nu kam vâryânî (1, 154, 1). Vişnu is in the sacrifice the same as deliberation in (worldly things). Just as an agriculturist) is going to make good the mistakes in ploughing, (and a king) in naking good a bad judgment by devising a good one, so the Hotar is going to make well recited" what was badly recited, and well chanted what was badly chanted, by repeating this verse addressed to Vişnu. 

He repeats a verse addressed to Prajapati, tantum tanvan rajaso (10, 53, 6). Tantu, i.e., thread, means offspring. By repeating this verse, the Hotar spreads (santanoti) for him (the sacrificer) Offspring. By the Words of this verse, jyotişmatah patho raksa dhiyd kritam, i.e., "protect the paths which are provided with lights, and made by absorption in meditation' wherein the term “ the paths provided with lights” means the roads of the gods (to heaven), the Hotar paves these roads (for the sacrificer to go on them on his way to heaven). 

By the words anulbanam vayata, i.e., "weave ye the work of the chanters and repeaters) so as to rid [229] it from all defects, become & Manu, produce a divine race," the Hotar propagates him through human offspring. (That is done) for production. He who has such a knowledge will be blessed with offspring and cattle. 

two ho are the strongest in power and most vigorous, who rule unconquerable through their strength, may these two, Vignu and Varuna, come on being called first." There is a grammatical difficulty in this translation : agan, which can be only explained as a third person plural of the aorist in the conjunctive, is here joined to nouns in the dual. The 4tlsxvayoda shows the same form. Here is an evident incorrectness, which perhaps was the reason for its being excluded from the Samta. 

** The woutranslatoa Ly " chantors and repeaters" is jogu. Say, explains it in his commentary on this passage of the Ait. Br. in the following männer : 

7h sama la startar gratis In his commentary on the .sveda Samhita (10, 53, 6, page 8 of my manuscript copy of the commentary on the 8th Aștaka), he explains it simply by piger i But I think the first deinition is too comprehensive, the latter too restricted, For, strictly speaking, the term atotar is only applicable to the chanters of the Samans. But the recital of the Rik mantras by the Iloiars, and the formulas of the Vajurveda by the Adhvaryu and his Assistants is about as important for the success of the sacrifice. All that is in cxcess (ulbanam), above what is required, is a hindrance to the sacrifice. Thonce all mistakes, by whatever priest they might have been committed, are to be propitiated. The word jogu, being au derivative of the root gu, s to sound," cannot mean sa sacrificial performer" in general, as Sly, supposes in his commentary on the Ait. Br., but such performers only think require principally the aid of their voice.

• He concludes with the verse eva na indro maghava virapsi (4, 17, 20). This earth is Indra maghava virapść, i.e., Indra, the strong, of manifold crafts. She is (also) satyd, the true, charşanidhrit, i.e., holding men anarva, safe. She is also) the räjá. In the words, sraro mahinam ini jaritre, malinam means the earth, śravo the sacrifice, and jarita the sacri ficer. By repeating ther, he asks for a blessing for the sacrificer. When he thus concludes, be ought to touch the earth on which he employs the sacrificial agency. On this earth he finally establishes the sacrifice. 

After having repeated the Agri-Viruta Sastra, he recites the Yájya.: agne marudbhih (5, 60, 8). Thus he satisfies (all) the deities, giving to each his due.

FOURTH CHAPTER. (On the Origin, Meaning, and Universal Nature of the Agnistoma as the model for other Sacrifices. On the Chatuştoma and Jyotiştoma.) 

89. (On the Origin of the name " Ágnistoma," and its Meaning.) 

The Devas went to war with the Asuras, in order to defeat them. Agni was not willing to follow them. The Devas then said to him, " Go thou also, for thou art one of us." He said, " I shall not go, unless a ceremony of praise is performed for me. Do ye that now.” So they did. They all rose up (from their places), turned towards Agni, and performed the ceremony of praising him. After having been praised, he followed them. He having assumed the shape of three rows, attacked in three battle lines the Asuras, in order to defeat them. The three rows were made only of the metres (Gayatri, Triştubh, Jagati). The three battle lines are only the three libations. He defeated them beyond expectation. Thence the Devas put down the Asuras. The enemy, the incarnate sin (påpman), the adversary of him who has such a knowledge, perishes by himself. 

The Agniştoma is just as the Gâyatri. The latter has twenty-four syllables (if all its three padas are counted) and the Agnistoma has twenty-four Stotras and Sastras. 

That is to say, twelve Stotras or performances of the Sima singers, and twelve Sastras or recitations of the Hotfimpriests. To each Stotra a Sastra corresponds. The $welve sastras are as follows:-(A) At the morning libation--1) the Ajya and 2) Pra-uga to be repeated by the Hotar, 3) the Sastra of the Maiträvaruna 4) of the Brahmanachhansi, and 5) of the "Achhavala. (B) At the midday libation-8) the Marutyatiya and 7) Niskovalya Sastras to be recited by the Hotar, 8) the Sastras of the Maitrâvaruna, 9) of the Brâhmanâchhansi, and 10) that of the Achhavaka, o At the evening libation-11) the Vaišvadeva, and 12) Agnimâruta Sastras to be repeated by the Hotar alone.

[231] It is just as they say : a horse if well managed freshitt) puts the rider into ease (sudha). This does also the Gayatri. She does not stop on the earth, but takes the sacrificer up to heaven. This does also the Agnistoma ; it does not stop on earth, but takes the sacrificer up to heaven. The Agniştoma is the year. The year has twenty-four half-months, and the Agnistoma twenty-four Stotras and Sastras. Just as waters flow into the sea, so go all sacrificial performances into the Agniştoma (i. e., are contained in it). 

(All Sacrificial Rites are Contained in the Agniştoma.) When the Dikşhanîya Isti is once performed in all its parts (lit., is spread), then all other Iştis, whatever they may be, are comprised in the Agniştorna.* 

When he calls Ilâ, then all Pâkayajñas,* whatever they may be, are comprised in the Agniştoma. 

[232] One brings the Agnihotram , in the morning and evening. They (the sacrificers when being initiated) perform in the morning and 

The meaning is, the Dîkşaņiya Isti is the model Işti or prakriti, of all the other Istis required at the Agnistona, such as the Prayanîya, &c., and is, besides, exactly of the same nature as other independent Istis, such as the Darspurnima Isti. 

• This is always done at overy occasion of the Agnistoma sacrifice, as often as the priests and the sacrificer eat of the sacrificial food, after having first given an oblation to the gods, by the words : ilopahútâ sahu diva briha adityena, &c. (Âsv. Sr. S. 1, 7). 

* This is the general name of the oblations offered in the so-called smärta agni or domestic fire of every Brahman, which are always distinguished from the sacrifices performed with the Vaitánika fires (Gârhapatya, Daksina, and Abayaniya). They are said to be seven in number. According to oral information founded on Narayana Bhatta's practical manual for the performance of all domestic rites, they are for the Rigveda As follows: 1) Srdvarákarma (an oblation principally given to Agni in the full moon of the month of Srá vana), 2) Sarpabali (an oblation of rice to the serpents), 3) A svayuji (an oblation to Rudra, the master of cattle), 4) Agrayana (an oblation to Indragni and the Viúvedevas), 5) Pratyavarohanam (an oblation to Svaita Vaidārava, a particular deity connected with the sun), 6) Pindapitriyaj na (an oblation to the manas), 7) Anyaştaka (another oblation to the manes). See Âsyal. Gșihya Sútras, 2, 1-4. The meaning of the word pika in the word på kayajra is doubtful. In all likelihood, pa ka here means "cooked, dressed food," which is always required at these oblations. Some Hindu Scholars whom Max Müller follows (History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p 203), explain it as "good." It is true the word is already used in the sense of “ripe, mature, excellent" in the Samhith of the Rigveda (see 7, 104, 8-9). In the sense of “ripening” we find it 1, 81, 14. But it is very donbtful to me whether by páka, a man particularly fit for performing sacrifices can be understood. The difference between the Srauta and Smärta oblations is, that at the former no food, cooked in any other than the sacred fires, can be offered to the gods, whilst at the latter an oblation is first cooked on the common hearth, and then offered in the sacred Smarta agni. 

• The sacrificer who is being initiated (who is made a Dîkşita) has to observe fast for several days (thtee at the Agaistoma) before he is allowed to take any substantial

evening the religious vow (of drinking milk only), and do that with the formula sváha. With the same formula one offers the Agnihotram. Thus the Agnihotram is comprised in the Agnistona. 

. At the Prậyanîya Işti the Hotar repeats fifteen [238] verses for the wooden sticks thrown into the fire (sâmidhenis). The same number 

is required at the New and Full Moon offerings. Thus the New and Full Moon offerings are comprised in the Pråyanîya Isti. 

They buy the king Soma (the ceremony of Somakraya? is meant). The king Soma belongs to the herbs. They cure (a sick person) by means of medicaments taken from the vegetable kingdom. All vegetable medicaments following the king Soma when being bought, they are thus comprised in the Agniştoma. . 

At the Atithya Isti s they produce fire by friction, and at the Chaturmâsya Iştis (they do the same). The Châturmâsya Iştis thus following the Atithya Işti, are comprised in the Agnistoma. 

At the Pravargya ceremony they use fresh milk, the same is the case at the Dakşdyana yajña. 9 Thus (284) the Dâkşayaņa sacrifice is comprised in the Agnistoma. food. He drinks in the morning and evening only milk, which is taken from the cow after sunrise and after sunset. He is allowed but a very small quantity, as much as remains from the milk of one nipple only after the calf has sucked. This fast is called a vrata, and as long as he is observing it he is vrataprada, i.e., fulfilling a row. See Hiraṇyakesi Sôtras, 7, 4. When doing this he repeats the mantra, ye devã manojata (Taitt. S. 1, 2, 3,1), which concludes with tebhyo ramas tebhyo svâha, i.eu, worship be to them, Syahd be to them. The Agnihotram being offered in the morning and evening always with the formula sváhá, the author of the Brahmanam believes that by these incidents the Agnihotram might be said to be contained in the Agnistona. 

to There are fifteen Samidheni verses required at the Prayanîya Işti, whilst at the Diksaņîyâ seventeen are requisite. Fifteen is the general number at most Istis. This number is therefore to be regarded as the prakriti, i. ls, standard, model, whilst any other number is a vikriti, ise, modification, 

Ou the buying of the Soma, see 1, 12-13. * On the producing of fire by friction at the Atithya Isti, see 1. 16-17. The same is done at the Châturmasya Iştis., See Kätsya-Sr. S. 5, 2, 1. 

9. The Dakşayana yajia belongs to that peculiar class of Istis which are called istyayanani, 1.d., oblations to be brought regularly during a certain period. They are, as to their nature, only modifications of the Darsapůrnamâsa Işti. It can be performed either on every Kull and New Moon during the life-time of the sacrificer, or during a period of fifteen years, or the whole course of oblations can be completed in one year. The rule is, that the number of oblations given must amount to at least 720. This number is obtained either by performing it every day twice during a whole year, or by making at every Full Moon day two oblations, and two others on every New Moon day during a space of fifteen years. The deities are, Agni-Soma at the Now Moon, and Indra. Agni and Mitra-Varupa at the Full Moon oblations. The offerings consist of Parodáša, sour milk (dadhi), and fresh milk (payas). On every day on which this sacrifice is performed, it must be performed twice. See Katiya. Sr. 5. 4, 4, 1-30 And A's, &r. 8, L 14. 

158 

The animal sacrifice takes place the day previous to the Soma feast. All animal sacrifices which follow it are this comprised in the Agniętoma. 

Ilâdacha 11 by name is a sacrificial rite. They perform it with thick milk (dadhi), and they also take thick milk at the time of making the Drdhigharmala rite (in the Agnistoma). Thus the Ilâdadha is, on account of its following the Dadhigharma rite, comprised in the Agniştoma. 

$1. (The Other Parts of Jyotiştoma, such as Ukthya, Atirâtra, Comprised in the 

Agniştoma.) 

Now the first part (of the Agaistoma) has been explained. After that has been performed, the fifteen Stotras and Sastras of the Ukthya ceremony [235] fllow. If they (the fifteen Slotras and fifteen Sastras) are taken together, they represent the year as divided into months (each consisting of thirty days). Agni Vaišvânarą is the year ; Agniştoma is Agni. The Ukthya by following (also) the order of the year is thus comprised in the Agniştoma. 

After the Ukthya has entered the Agniştoma, the Vâjapeya 19 follows it; for it exceeds (the number of the Stotras of) the Ukthya (by two only), 

The twelve turns of the Soma cups 14 at night (at the Atira tra Soma 20 On the animal sacrifice, see 2, 1-14 The animal sacrifices are called here, pasu bandia. Some such as the Nzrudita Pasubandha can precede the Agniştoma. 

11 Ilådadha is another modification of the Daráapärgamasa Istis. Its principal part is sour milk. See ASY. 2, 14. 

12 On the Dadhi-ghapma, the draught of sour milk, see Åsv. 5, 13, and Hiraggakesi śr. Sätr. 9,%. It is prepared and drunk by the priests after an oblation of it has been thrown into the fire, at the midday libation of the Soma feast just boloro tbc recital of the Marutyatiya sastra. The ceremony is chiefly performed by the Pratiprasthathar, who, after having taken sour milk with a spoon of Udumbara wood, makes it hot under the recital of the mantra, väkcha två manascha Srinitâm, &c., in which Speech and Mind, the two vital airs (prane and apana), oye and ear, Wisdom and Strength, Power and Qaickness in action, are invoked to cook it. After having repeated this mantra and made hot the offering, he says to the Hotar, " The offering is cooked, řepeat the Yljyä for the Dadhi-gharma." The latter repeats, “ The offering is cooled; I think it cooked - in the udder (of the cow) and cooked in the fire. Vauşat! Agni, eat the Dadhi-gharına, 

Vausat !” Then the Hotar repeats another mantra, mayi tyad indriyam břihlas (Asy. Sr. 5, 13), whereupon the priests eat it, 

13 This is a particular Soma sacrifice, generally taken as part of Jyotiştoma, which is said to be sapta-sansthå, i.e., consisting of seven parts. 

14 This' refers to the arrangement for the great Soma banquets held at night when celebrating the Atirâtra. In the evening, after a Soma libation has been given to the fire from the solast"Graha, the Soma cups are passed in a certain order. There are four such orders called ganas. At the ürst, the cup of the Hotar takes the lead, at the second that 

159 feast) are on the whole joined to the fifteen verses by means of which the Stotras are performed. Two ?s of those turns belonging alıyays together, the number of the Stotra verses to which they (the turns) belong, is. brought to thirty (by multiplying the number fifteen with these two). (But the number thirty is to be obtained in another way also for the Atirâtra). The Solasi Sâman is twenty-one-fold, and the Sandhi (a Såman at the end of Atiråtra) is triorit, i.e., nine-fold, which amounts in all to thirty. There are thirty nights in every month all the year round. Agni Vaišvånara is the year, and Agni is the Agniştoma. The Atirâ tra is, by thus following (the order of) the year, comprised (236) in the Agniştoma, and the Aptoryâma sacrifice follows the track of the Atirâtra when entering the Agnistoma. For it becomes also an Atirâ tra. Thus all sacrificial rites which precede the Agniştoma, as well as those which come after it, are comprised in it. 

All the Stotra verses of the Agnistoma amount, if counted, to one hundred and ninety. For ninety are the ten trivritas (three times three-nine). (The number hundred is obtained thus) ninety are ten (trivritas), but of the number ten one Stotriyi verse is in excess ; the rest is the Trivrit (nine), which is taken twenty-one-fold ?* (this makes 189) and represents by this number that one (the sun) which is put over (the others), and burns. This is the Vişuvan 17 (equator), which has ten Trivrit Stomas before it and ten after it, and, being placed in the midst of both, turns above them, and burns (like the sun). The one Stotriyâ verse which is in excess, is put in that (Visuvan which is the twenty-first) and placed over it (like a cover). This is the sacrificer. This (the twenty-one-fola Trivrit Stoma) is the divine Kşatram (sovereign power), which has the power of defying any attack. 

He who has such a knowledge obtains the divine Kştram, which has the power for defying any attack, and becomes assimilated to it, assumes its shape, and takes the same place with it. 

42. (Why Four Stomas are Required at the Agniştoma.) The Devas after having (once upon a time) been defeated by the Asuras, started for the celestial world. of the Maiträvaruna, at the third that of the Brahmanachhansi, and at the fourth that of the Achhâ vâka. This is thrice repeated, which makes twelve turus in all. $ây. 

16 Always two turns are presided over by one priest, the first two by the Adhvarya, the following two by the Pratiprasthätar. 

20 The 190 Stotriya verses of the Agniştome comprise the number 21 nine times taken, one being only in excess.

[237] Agni touching the sky (from his place on earth), entered the upper region (with his flames), and closed the gate of the celestial world; for Agni is its master. The Vasus first approached him and said: “Mayest thou allow us to pass over (thy flames) to enter (heaven); give us an oppor tunity (@kaisa.)" Agui said, “ Being not praised (by you), I shall not allow you to pass through the gate). Praise me now.” So they did. They praised him with nine verses (the Trivrit Stoma).18 After they had 

13 The Trivrit Stoma consists of the nine verses of the Bahispavamana Stotr& (see Samaveda Samh. 2, 1-9), which are sung in three turns, each accompanied by the Himkâra. In this Stoma, the same verses arenot sung repeatedly, as is the case with all other Stomas, There are three kinds (vistuti) of this Stoma mentioned in the Tândya Brâhınanam 2, 1-2, called the udyati trivrito viştuti, parivarttini, and kulayinê. The difference of these three kinds lies in the order which is assigned to each of the three verses which form one tarp (paryaya), and in the application of the Himkâra (the sound hum pronounced very loudly) which always belongs to one turn. The arrangement of all the verses which form part of the Stoma (the whole musical piece), in three turns, each with a particular order for its several verses, and their repetition, is called in the technical language of the Sama singers a vístuti. Each Stoma has several variations. The first variation of the Trivșit Stoma is the udyatî, i.e., the rising. This kind is very simple. The Him kära is pronounced in the first paryâya at the first verse (tissibhyohim haroti sa prathamaya), in the second at the middle verse of the triplet (tisribhyo himkaroti SA madhyamaya), and in the third, at the last verse (tisribhyo himkaroti sa uttamayá). The parivarttini viştuti consist in singing the several verses of the triplet in all three turns in the inverted order, that is to say, the first is always made the last, and the last the first (tis;ibhyo himkaroti sa paráchibhih). The kuţáyini viştuti is more complicated than the two others. In the first turn, the order of the verses is inverted (tissibhyo hiinkaroti sa parachibhiḥ), in the second turn the middle verse is made the first, the last becomes the riddle verse and the irst becomes the last (tisribhyo himkaroti ya madhyama sa prathama, ya uttama sci madhyami, yů prathama så uttamá); in the third turn, the last becomes the first, the first the second, and the second the last. The Sâmå singers mark the several turns, and the order of each verse in' it as well as the number of repetitions by small sticks cut from the wood of the Udumbara tree, the trunk of which must always be placed behind the seat of the Udgâtar. They are called kuśás. Each of the three divisions of each set in which they are put is called vistava. Their making is minutely described in the Latyayana Sútras, 2,6.

After having got them made of the length of a span (the space between the thumb and forefinger stretched), so that the part which is covered with bark resembles the back of the kusa grass, the fibre part of táo stick being quite even, as big as the link of the thumb, the ends being prominent (easily to be recognized), he should besmear them with odoriferous substances, but at the Sattras, as some say, with liquid butter, pat the cloth used for the Vistatis, which is made of linen, or flax, or cotton, round them and place them, above the Udumbara branoh (always required when singing).

The Rudras approached him and said in Lissi !fisil, us to pass on; give us an opportunity (by moderatug this flames!." He answered, “If I be not praised, I shall not allow you to pass. Praise me now.” They consented. Ther praised him with fifteen verses 19 After they had done so, he allowed (238) them to pass, that they might enter the (celestial) world. 

The Adityas approached and said to hin, “Hayest thou allow us to pass on; give us an opportunity." He answered, “If I be not praised, T shall not allow you to pass, Praise me not!” They consented. They praised him with seventeen Ferses. After they had done so, he allowed them to pass, that they might enter the (celestial) world. 

The Viśve Devâs approached and said to him, “ Marest thou allow us to pass on; give us an opportunity." He answered: If I be not praised, I shall not allow you to pass. Praise me now!" They consented. They praised him vith twenty-one verses. After they had done so, he allowed them to pass, that they might enter the (celestial) world. 

The gods having praised Agni each with another Stoma (combination of verses), he allowed them to pass. 

The sacrificer who praisesgni with all (four) Stomas, as well as he (the priest) who knows it (the Agnistoma) will pass on beyond him (Agni, who watches with his flames the entrance to heaven).25 

To him who has such a knowledge, he (Agni) allows to pass and enter the celestial world.

The Agnżştoma is Endless). The Agnistoma is Agni. It is called so, because they (the gods) 

29 This is the so-called Panchadasa Stoma. The arrangement is die same as with the Trivrit Stoma. The same triplet of verses is hera retired for each of the three turns. Hach turn is to consist of five verses. In the first turn, the first verse is chanted thrice, tbe second once, the third once (pê 17 chabryo limkaroti sa tisribril sa ekayá sa ekay.); in the second turn the first verse is chanted once, the second thrice, the third once ; in tho third turn the first and second verses are chanted each once, but the third thrice. This Stoma is required for those Samans of the morning libation which follow the Bahiş. pavamánas. The saptadaśa and ekaviinsa stomas follow the same order as the panchacasa. The several verses of the triplet are in three turns chanted so many times as to obtain respectively the number 17 and 21. The former is appropriate to the midday libation, the latter to the evening libation. 

** In this sentence, we have two peculiar forms: uti, instead of ati, beyond, and aris tdi, 3rd pers, conjanet, middle yoice, in the sense of a fatore,

praised him with this Stoma. They called it so to hide the proper meaning of the word ; [240] for the gods like to hide the proper meaning of words. 

On account of four classes of gods having praised Agni with four Stomas, the whole was called Chatuhstoma (containing four Stomas). They called it so to hide the proper meaning of the word ; for the gods like to hide the proper meaning of words. 

If (the Agnistoma) is called Jyotiştoma, for they praised Agni when he had risen up (to the sky) in the shape of a light (jyotis.) They called it so to hide the proper meaning of the word; for the gods like to hide the proper meaning of words. 

This (Agniştoma) is a sacrificial performance which has no beginning and no end. The Agniştoma is like the endless wheel of a carriage. The beginning (prêyaniya) and the conclusion (udayaniya) of it are alike Gust as the two wheels of a carriage.) 

About this there is a sacrificial stanza sung, "What is its (of the Agniştoma) beginning, that is its end, and what is its end, that is its seginning ; just as the Såkala serpent, it moves in a circle, that none can distinguish its first part from its last part.” For its opening (the pre yaniya) was (also) its conclusion.21 

Bat to this sone raise objections, saying, " they make the beginning (of the Stotras of the Soma day) with the Trivrit Stoma, and conclude with the twenty-one-fold Stoma (at the evening libation); how are they (the beginning and conclusion) then alike?” To this one should answer, " They are alike as far as the twenty-one-fold Stoma is also a Trivrit Stoma, for both contain triplets of verses, and have their nature. ??

For performing the twenty-one-fold Stonia at the evening libation, the Yajnayajniya Saman is used, which consists only of two verses, but by repeating some parts of them twice, the number of three yerses is obtained. The same triplet being canted in three turns (paryaya,) the twenty-onc-fold Stoma appears to be like the Trivrit.

It being a sáhna, i.e., going with the day, they should not per form it hurriedly in order to finish it before the day is over), neither as the morning, nor midday, nor evening libations. (Should they do so the sacrificer would suddenly die. 

When they do not perform hurriedly ( nly) the rites of the morra ing and midday libations, but hurry over the rites of the evening libation, then this, viz., the villages lying in the eastern direction, become largely populated, whilst all that is in the western direction becomes a long tract of deserts, and the sacrificer dies suddenly. Thence they ought to perform without any hurry the rites of the morning and midday, as well as those of the evening libation. (If they do soy the sacrificer will not suddenly die. 

In repeating the Sastras, the Hotar ought to be guided by the (daily) course of the sun). In the [242] morning time, at sunrise, it burns but slowly. Thence the Hotar should repeat the Sastras at the morning libation with a feeble voice. 

When the sun is rising higher up on the horizon), it burns with greater force. Thence the Hotar should repeat the Sastras at the mid day libation with a strong voice. 

When the sun faces men most (after having passed the meridian), it burns with the greatest force. Thence the Hotar should repeat the Sas tras at the third (evening) libation with an extremely strong voice. He should (only) then (commence to) repeat it so (with the greatest force of his voice), when he should be complete master of his full voice. For this Sastra is Speech. Should he continue to repeat (the Sastras of the third libation) with the same strength of voice with which he commenced tha. repetition, up to the end, then his. recitation will be admirably well ac complished. 

The sun does never set nor rise. When people think the sun is setting (it is not so). For, after having arrived at the end of the day, it makes itself produce two opposite effects, making night to what is below and day to what is on the other side.

45. (How the Gods recoveredt he Sacrifice whih had gone from them. 

How they Performed Different Rites. Under what Conditions the 

Sacrifice is Effectual.) 

The sacrifice once left the gods and went to nourishing substances. The gods said, "The sacrifice has gone from us to nourishing substances, let us seek both the sacrifice and the nourishment by means of a Brah mana and the metres." So they did. They initiated a Brâhmana by means of the metres. They performed all the rites of the Dikșaniya Isti up to the end, including even the Patni-samyâjas. On account of the gods having at that occasion performed all the rites at the Dik şaniya Isti up to the end, including even the Patnî-samyâ jas,2 mep followed afterwards the same practice. The gods (in their search for the sacrifice) came very near it by means of the Prayapiya Işti. They performed the ceremonies with great baste and finished the Işti already with the Samyuvâka.3. This is the reason that the Prâyaņiya Isti ends with Samyuvâka; for men followed (afterwards) this practice.

reason that the Atithya Işti is finished with the Iļâ; for men followed (afterwards) this practice, 

The gods performed the rites of the Upasads 5 and came by means of them very near the sacrifice. They performed hastily the ceremonies, repeating only three Sâmidheni verses, and the Yâjyâs for three deities. This is the reason that at the Upasad Isti only three Sâmidhenis are repeated, and Yâjyâ verses to three deities; for men followed (afterwards) this practice. 

The gods performed the rites of the upavasatíra (the eve of the Soma festival). On the upavasatha day they reached the sacrifice. After having reached the sacrifice (Yajña), they performed all its rites severally, even including the Patni-sanyâjas. This is the reason that they perforin at the day previous to the Soma festival all rites to the end, even in cluding the Patni-saiyâjas. 

This is the reason that the Hotar should repeat the mantras at all ceremonies preceding the Upavasatha day (at which the animal sacrifice is off ere) with a very slow voice. For the gods came at it (the sacrifice) by performing the several rites in such a manner as if they were searching (after something, i.e., slowly). 

This is the reason that the Hotar may repeat on the Upavasatha day (after having reached the sacrifice) [245] the mantras, in whatever tone he might like to recite them. For, at that occasion the sacrifice is already reached (and the "searching" tone of repeating not required). 

The gods, after having reached the sacrifice, said to him, “ Stand still to be our food." He answered, " No. How should I stand still for you (to be your food)?” He then only looked at them. They said to him, “Because of thy having become united with a Brâhmaņa and the metres, thou shalt stand still.” He consented. 

· That is the reason that the sacrifice (only) when joined to a Brâhma na and metres carries the oblations to the gods." 

5 See 41, 23-26. At the Upasad Isti only three Sâmidheni verses are required, whilst their number in other Istis amounts to fifteen, and now and then to seventeen. See page 56. 

6 This is the day for the animal sacrifice, called Agnizomiya. See 2, 1-14. 

* The drift of this paragraph is to show, that, for the successful performance of the sacrifice, Brahmanas, as well as the verses composed in the different metres and preserv ed by Brâhmanas only, are indispensible. The Kşattriyas and other castes were to be deluded into the belief that they could not perform any sacrifice with the slightest chance of success, if they did not appoint råhmaņas and employ the verses of the Rigveda, which were chiefly preserved by the Braumaņas only.

56. (On Three Mistakes which might be made in the Appointment of Priests. How they are to be Remedied.) 

Three things occur at the sacrifice : Offals, devoured food, and vomited food. Offals (jagdha) occur when one appoints to the office of & sacrificial priest one who offers his services, thinking "be (the sacrificer) give me something, or he should choose me for the performance of his sacrifice." 8 This (to appoint such a man to the office of a priest) is as should perverse as ito eat) the offals of a meal (which are generally not touched by others). For the acts of such a one do not benefit the sacrificer. 

(246) Devoured (gîrnam) is that, when a sacrificer appoints some one to the office of a priest out of fear, thinking," he might kill me (at some future occasion), or disturb my sacrifice (if I do not choose him for the office of a priest)." This is as perverse as if food is devoured (not eaten in the proper way). For the acts of such a one do not benefit the sacrificer (as little as the devouring of food with greediness benefits the body). 

Vomited (vânta) is that, when a sacrificer appoints to the office of a priest a man who is ill-spoken of. Just as men take disgust at anything that is vomited, so the gods take also disgust at such a man. This (to appoint such a man) is as disgusting as something vomited. For the acts of such a man do not benefit the sacriicer. 

The sacrificer ought not to cherish the thought of appointing any one belonging to these three classes (just described). Should he, how ever, involuntarily (by mistake) appoint one of these three, then the penance (for this fault) is the chanting of the Vâmadevya Sâman. Fox this Vâmadevyam is the whole universe, the world of the sacrificer (the earth), the world of the immortals, and the celestial world. This Saman (which is in the Gâyatri metre) falls short of three syllables. * When going to perform this chant, he hould divide the word puruşa, denot ing his own self, into three syllables, and insert one of them at the end of each pada (of the verse abhi şu na). Thus he puts himself in these worlds, viz., [247] the world of the sarificer, thato the immortals, and 

The sacrifices must always himself choose his priests by addressing them in due form. No one should offer his services ; but he must be asked by the man who wishes to perform a sacrifice. 

* The Vámadeyyam consists of the three verses, kaya naśchitra, las tvá satyo, and abhi şu nah (See Sámayeda Samh.2, 32-34). All three are in the Gayatri metre. But the last abhi şu has, instead of twenty-four, only twenty-one syllables, wanting in every pada one syllable. To make it to consist of twenty-four also, the repeater bas at this occasion to add to the first pada pu, to the second ru, to the third gae 

167 

the celestial world. (By chanting this Såman) the sacrificer overcoines all obstacles arising from mistakes in the performance of the sacrifice (and obtains nevertheless what he was sacrificing for). 

He (the Rişi of the Aitareyins), moreover, has told that the sacrifi cer should mutter (as japc) the Vâmadevyam in the way described (above), even if the performing priests were all of unexceptionable character. 

47. The Offerings to Dhatar and the Devikas : Anumati, Rakå, 

Sinivali, Kuhu.) The metres (chhanda nsi), having carried the offerings to the gods, became (once) tired, and stood still on the latter part of the sacrifice's tail, just as a horse or a mule after having carried a load (to a distant place) stands still. 

(In order to refresh the fatigued deities of the metres) the priest ought, after the Purodása belonging to the animal slaughtered for Mitra Varuņa "o has been offered, portion out the rice for the devikâ havinşi (offerings for the inferior deities). 

For Dhâtar, he should make a rice ball (the Purodaga) to be put on twelve potsherds. Dhâtar is the Vasatkâra. 

To Anumati (he should offer) a portion of boiled rice charu; for Anumati is Gâyatri, 

To Räkâ (he should offer) a portion of boiled rice ; for she is Triştubh. 

The same (he should offer) to Sinivalt and Kunt ; for Sintvale is Jagati, and Kuhú Anustubh. These are all the metres. For all other metres (used at the sacrifice) follow the Gayatri, Triştubh, Jagati, and [248] Anustubh, as their models. If, therefore, one sacrifices for these motres only, it has the same effect as if he had sacrificed for all of them. 

The (common) saying, “ the horse if well managed (suhita) puts him (the rider) into ease," is applicable to the metres; for they put (if well treated) the sacrificer into ease (sudha, comfort or happiness of any kind). He wło has such a knowledge, obtains such a world (of bliss) as he did not expect. 

Regarding these (devika) oblations, some are of opinion that before each oblation to all (the several) goddesses, the priest ought to make an oblation of melted butter to Dhåtar ;for thus he would make all the goddesses (to whom oblations are given along with the Dhâtar) cohabit with the Dhâtar. 

10 This is done at the end of the Agnistoma sacrifice. 

108 

Ibout this they say: it is laziness ?? (at a sacrifice) to repeat the same two verses (the Puronuvâkyâ and Yâjyâ for the Dhâtar) on the same day (several times)." (It is sufficient to repeat those two verses once only.) For even many wives cohabit with one and the same husband only. When the Hotar, therefore, repeats, before addressing the (four) goddesses, the Yajyâ verse for the Dhâtar, he thus [249] cohabits with all goddesses. So much about the oblations to the minor goddesses (derika). 

48. (The Offerings for Sürya and the Devis, Dydus, Uşds, Gaus, Prithivi, 

who are Represented by the Metres. When Oblations should be giver 

to both the Devikás and Devis. Story of Vriddhadyumna.) Now about the offerings to the goddesses (deví). 13 

The Adhvaryu ought to portion out for Sûrya (the sun) rice for a ball to be put on one potsherd (ekakapala). Sûrya is Dhâtar (creator), and this is the Vaşatkâra. 

To Dyâus (Heaven) he ought to offer boiled rice For Dyâus is Anumati, and she is Gâyatri. 

To Uşas (Dawn) he ought to offer boiled rice. For Uşås is Rakâ, and she is Triştubb. 

To Gâus (Cow) he ought to offer boiled rice. For Gâus is Sinîvâlî, and she is Jagati. 

To Prithivi (Earth) he ought to offer boiled rice. For Prithivi is Kuhu, and she is Anustubh. 

All other metres which are used at the sacrifice, follow the Gâyatri, Trişttubh, Jagati and Anustubh as their models (which are most fre quently used). 

11 The word jâmi is explained by alasyam. 

12 Both the Anuvákyâ and Yâjyâ for the Dhatar are not in the Samhitâ, but in the A'val. Śr. 8. 6, 14. The Anuvâkya is : 

धाता ददातु दाशुषे प्राची जीवातुमक्षितां । az e STAR Fafá aftalaa: 1 (Atharvaveda S, 7, 17, 2). The Yájyâ is : ETAT FARIE ART get mad fara yaai ar 1. 

धाता कृष्टोरनिमिषाभिचष्टे धान इद्धन्यं धृतवज्जुहोता ॥ The oblations to the Dhåtar who is the same as Tvaştar, and the four goddesses mentioned, form part of the Udayaniya or concluding Tşti. The ceremony is called Maitra varuani amaksa, (i.eu, the amiksa dish for Mitra-Varupa). Mitra-Varuna are first invoked, then follow Dhâtar and the goddesses. : 

13 Instead of the devika offerings those for the devis might be chosen. The effect is the same. The place of the Dhåtar is occupied by Sorya, who himself is regarded as a Dhâtar, 1.C., Creator. 

! 

169 

The sacrifice of him who, having such a knowledge, gives oblations to these metres, 14 includes (then) oblations to all metres. 

The (common) saying, “ the horse, if well managed, puts him (the rider) into ease," is applicable to the metres, for they put the sacrificer (if well treated) [250] into ease (sudha). He who has such a knowledge, obtains such a world (of bliss) as he did not expect. 

Regarding these (oblations to the Devis), some are of opinion that, before each oblation to all (the several) goddesses, one ought to offer melted butter to Sürya ; for thus one would make all goddesses cohabit with Sürya. 

About this they say, it is laziness at a sacrifice to repeat (several times, the same two verses (the Puronuvákyâ and Yâjyå for Surya) on the same day. (It is sufficient to repeat those verses once only). For even many wives cohabit with one (and the same) husband only. When the Hotar, therefore, repeats before addressing the (four) goddesses, the Yajya verse for Sûrya, he thus cohabits with all goddesses. 

These (Sürya with Dyâus, &c.) deities are the same as those others (Dhâtar with Anumati, &c.) One obtains, therefore, through one of these (classes of deities), the gratification of any desire which is in the gift of both. 

The priest ought to portion out a rice-cake ball for both these classes tof deities) for him who desires the faculty of producing offspring (to make him obtain) the blessings contained in both. But he ought not to do so for him who sacrifices for acquiring great wealth only. If he were to portion out a rice-cake ball for both these classes (of deities) for him who sacrifices for acquiring wealth only, he has it in his power to make the gods displeased (jealous) with the wealth of the sacrificer (and deprive him of it); for such one might think (after having obtained the great Wealth he is sacrificing for), 'I have enough (and do not require anything else from the gods). 

Süchivriksa Gaupâlâyana had once portioned out the rice ball for both classes (of deities) at the sacrifice [251] of Vriddhadyumna Pratarina. As he (afterwards) saw a prince swim in water), he said, “ This is owing to the circumstance that I made the goddesses of the higher and lower ranks (devis and devikås) quite pleased at the sacrifice of that king; there fore the royal prince swims (in the water). (Moreover, he saw not only 

14 The instrumental etain chhandobhih must here be taken in the sense of a dative, Bor the whole refers to oblations given to the metres, not to those offered through them to the gods. 

170 him) but sixty-four (other) heroes always steel-clad, who were his sons and grandsons. 15 

(Origin of the Ukthya. The Sakamaśram Samans. The Pramania 

hişthiya Saman.) 16 The Devas took shelter in the Agniştoma, and the Asuras in the Ukthyas. Both being (thus) of (252) equal strength, the gods could not turn them out. One of the Rişis, Bharadvâja, saw them (and said), " These Asuras have entered the Ukthas (Sastras) ; but none (else) sees them." He called out Agni with the mantra : ehy û şu bravâni (6, 16, 

15 l'he king had performed the sacrifice for obtaining offspring, and became blessed with them, 

16 The Ukthya is a slight modification of the Agnistoma sacrifoe. The noun to be supplied to it is kratu. It is a Soma sacrifice also, and one of the seven Samsthas or component parts of the Jyotiştoman Its name indicates its nature. For Ukthya means * what refers to the Uktha," which is an older name for sastra, i.e., a recitation of one of the Hotri priests at the time of the Soma libations. Whilst the Agnistoma bas twelve recitations, the Ukthya has fifteen. The first twelve recitations of the Ukthya are the same as those of the Agnistoma, to these, three are added, which are want ing in the Aguistoma. For, at the evening libation of the latter sacrifice, there are only two bastras, the Vaišvadova and Agni-Maruta, both to be repeated by the Hotar. The three Sastras of the so-called Hotrakas, i en, minor Hotri-priests, who are (accord ing to Âs' val. sr. S. 5, 10), the Prasastar (another name of the Maiträvaruna), the Bra binaachhansi, and Achhaudha, are left ont. But just these three Sastras which are briely described by Âśvalâ yana (Sr. S. 6,1) form a necessary part of the Ukthya. Thus this sacrifice is only a kind of supplement to the Aguiştoma. 

There is some more difference in the Samans than in the Rik verses required at the Okthya. Of the three triplets which constitute the Bahigpavamâna Stotra" (see page 120) at the morning libation of the Agniętoma, only the two last are employed; for the first another one is chosen, pavasta vacho agriyah (Sam, Saniah 2, 125.-27). The four remaining Stotras of the morning libation, the so-called Ajya-stotráni, are different. They are all together in the Samaveda Samh, (2, 140-152). At the midday libation, there is the Brihat-Sâma (tvam iddhi havámahe, Sam. S. , 169-160) used instead of the Rathantaran ; the Syartam (abhi pra vah suradha-sam, Sám. 8. 2, 161-82 (instead of the Våpadevyam). At the evening libation, there are three Stotras required, in addition to those of the Agnistona. (See note 18 to this chapter). 

In the Hirappakesi Satras (Ø, 18), the following description of the Ukthya is given : 

उक्थ्येन पचकामो यजेत । तस्याग्निष्टोमे कल्पो व्याख्यातः । पंचदश छदिसदः क्रतुकरणं हुत्वा एतेन मंत्रेण मध्यमे परिधावभ्यंतरले निर्माष्टय न्द्रामुकथ्ये द्वितीयं सवनायमालमते। तृतीयसवने धाराग्रहकाल प्राप्रयणं गृहीत्वाकथ्यं गृहणात्येग्निष्टोमचमसानुन्नयं त्रिभ्यश्चमसगणेभ्यो राजानमतिरे चयति सर्व राजानमुन्तय मातिरो रिच देशामिः कलशो मृष्टवा न्युबजेति च लुप्यत एतदग्निष्टोमचमसानो संवस्य यो य उत्तमः संस्थानचमसगणस्तमुन्नयन्नेतसंप्रेष्यत्यग्निष्टोमचमसैः प्रचर्य त्रिभिस्वथ्यविग्रहः प्रचरता यथा पुरस्तादिद्राय वरुणाभ्यां स्वेति प्रथमे ग्रहणसाइनो संनमन्तीन्द्रावृहस्पतिभ्यां स्वेति द्वितीय इन्द्राविण्य स्वेति तृतीचे,

16). The itarâ giral, i.e., other voices (mentioned in this verse) are those of the Asuras. Agni rose thereupon " and said :“What is it, then, that the lean, long, pale has to tell me?" For Bharadvája vas lean, of high stature, and pale. He answered, " These Asuras have entered the Ukthas (Sastras) ; but nobody is aware of them." 

Agni then turned into a horse, ran against them and overtook them. This act of Agni became the Sakamašvam 18 Så man. Thence it is called so 'from aśva, a horse). 

[258] About this they say, the priest ought to lead the Ukthas by means of the Sâkamayyam. For if the Ukthas (Sastras) have another head save the Så kamašvam, they are not led at all. 

They say, the priest should lead (the Ukthas) with the Pramaṁhis thiya Siman (Sâm. Samh. 2, 228, 229=2, 2, 2, 17, 1, 2); for, by means of this Så man, the Devas had turned the Asuras from the Ukthas. 

(Which of both these opinions is preferable, cannot be settled.) He is at liberty to lead (the Ukthas) by means of the Pramamhişthiya or the Sakamašva.* 

50. (The Sastras of the Three Minor Hotri-priests at the Evening Libation 

of the Ukthya Sacrifice.) The Asuras entered the Uktha (Sastra) of the Maitrâvaruņa. Indra said, "Who will join me, that we both might turn these Asuras out from here (the Sastra of the Maiträvaruņa)?” “I," said Varuna. Thence the Maitrâvaruņa repeats a hymn for Indra-Varuņa 21 at the evening liba tion. Indra and Varuņa then turned them out from it (the Sastra of the Maitrâvaruña). 

[254] The Asuras having been turned out from this place, entered the Sastra of the Brâhmanâchhařsi. Indra said, “Who will join me, that we both might turn the Asuras out from this place ?" Brihaspati answered, "I (will join you)." Thence the Brahmaņâchhamsi repeats at 

17 Såy, reads upottişthana, but my MSS. have all tipottisthanu, u being an eur cilitic. 

18 This Saman consists of the three verses, eny ü suo bravari yatra Fcvacha te and na hi te púrtam (Sâmaveda Samh. 2, 55-57). This Sâman is regarded as the leader of the whole Ukthya ceremony, that is to say, as the principal S&man. Thence the two other Såmans, which follow it at this ceremony, the Saubharam (viyam u tván, Sám hinge 2, 58-59), 5 and the Narmadhasam (adhá lindra girvana 2, 60-62), aro called in the Sáma prayogas the second and third såkanaśuan. 

1* At the Ukthya ceremonies which were performed in the Dekkban, more than ten years ago, only the Sakamasvan saman was ased. 

20 This meaning is conveyed by the particle aha, which has here about the same sense as athavá, as Sây. justly remarks, 

21 This is Indr&-yarund yuvam (7, 82).the evening libation an Aindra-Barhaspatya bymn". Indra and Brihaspati turned the Asuras out from it. 

The Asuras, after having been turned out from it, entered the Sastra of the Achhân váka. Indra said, “Who will join me, that we both might turn out the Asuras from here?” Vişņu answered, "I (will join you.)" Thence the Achhâvâka repeats at the evening libation an Aindra Vaisnava hymn.” Indra and Vişnu turned the Asuras out from this place. 

The deities who are (successively) praised along with Indra, form (each) a pair with (him). A pair is a couple, consisting of a male and female. 

rom this pair such a couple is produced for production. He who has such a knowledge, is blessed with children and cattle. 

The Rituyâjas of both the Potar and Nestar amount to four.* The (Yâjyâs to be recited by them along with the other Hotars) are six verses. This is a Virât which contains the number ten. Thus they complete the sacrifice with a Virât, which contains the number ten (three times ten). 

22 This is ud apruto na vayo (10, 68). 23 This is sam vam karmanâ (6,69). 

26 The Potar has to repeat the second and eighth, the Nestar the third and ninth Ritoyâja, see page 135-36. At each of the three bastras of the Ukthya, each of these two priests has also to recite & Yájyd. This makes“ six. If they are added to the four Rituyajas, then the number ten is obtained, which represents the Virat.

[255] FOURTH BOOK. 

### 01
FIRST CHAPTER. (On the Solaśi and Atiratra Sacrifices.) 

1. (On the Nature of the Solaśi, and the Origin of its Name. On the Anuşçubh 

Nature of the Solasi Sastra.) The gods prepared for Indra, by means of the Soma ceremony) of the first day, the thunderbolt; by means (of the Soma ceremony) of the second day, they cooled it (after having forged it, to increase its sharpness); by means (of the Soma ceremony) of the third day, they presented it (to him); by means of the Soma ceremony of the fourth day, he struck with it (his enemies). 

Thence the Hotar repeats on the fourth day the Sołaśt* Sastra. The Solaši is the thunderbolt. [256] By reciting the Solasi on the fourth day, he strikes a blow at the enemy (and) adversary (of the sacrificer), in order to put down any one who is to be put down by him (the sacrificer), 

The Soļast is the thunderbolt; the Sastras (Ukthas) are cattle He repeats it as a cover over the Sastras (of the evening libation). By doing so he surrounds cattle with a weapon in the form of) the Solasi (and tames them). Therefore cattle return to men if threatened round about with the weapon (in the form) of the Solasi. 

The first, second day, &c. refer to the so-called sal-aħa or six days' sacrifice, about which see the 3rd chapter of this Pañchika. 

* The Solasi sacrifice is almost identical with the Ukthya The Samans and Sastras at all three libations are the same. The only distinctive features are the use of the Solasī graha, the chanting of the Gaurivîtam or Nânadam Saman, and the recital of the Solasî sastra, after the Ukthâni (the Sâmans of the evening libation) have been chanted, and their respective sastras recited. The Solasî Sastra is of a peculiar composition. It is here minutely described, and also in the Âśv. śr. S. 6. 2. The namber sixteen prevails in the arrangement of this sastra, which is itself the six teenth on the day on which it is repeated. Thence the name. * The substantive to be supplied is, kratu. The whole term means, the sacrificial performance which contains the number sisteen," The Anustubh metre consisting of twice sixteen syllables, the whole sastra has the Anuştubh character. It commences with six verses in the Anustubh metrecalled by Âśv, though improperly, Stotriya and Anurópa (for the Stotriya verse of the Sastra is always chanted by the Säma singers, but this is not the case with the verse in question). These are: asávi somâ indra te (1, 84, 1-6). 

174 

Thence a horse, or a man, or a cow, or an elephant, after having been (once) tamed, return by themselves to their owner), if they are only commanded (by the owner) with the voice (to return). 

fle who sees the weapon (in the form of) the Solasi (Sastra), is sub dued by means of this weapon only. For voice is a weapon, and the Solasi is voice (being recited by means of the voice). 

About this they ask, Whence comes the name "Solasi " (sixteen) ? (The answer is) There are sixteen Stotras, and sixteen Sastras. The Hotar stops after having repeated the first) sixteen syllables (of the Anustubb verse required for the Solasi Sastra), and pronounces the word oon after (having repeated the latter) sixteen syllables (of the Anuştubh). He puts in it (the hymn required at the Solasi Sastra) a Nivid of sixteen padas (small sentences). This is the reason that it is called Şoladi. But two syllables are in excess (for in the second-half there are eighteen, instead of sixteen) in the Anuştubh, [257] which forms a component part of the Şolasi Sastra. For Speech (represented by the Anuştubh) has (as a female deity) two breasts; these are truth and untruth. Truth protects him who has such a knowledge, and untruth does no harm to such one.

(On the Way of Repeating the şolast Sastra. On the Application of the Gaurivíti or Nanada Sâman.) 

He who desires beauty and the acquirement of sacred knowledge ought to use the Gaurivitamas (the proper) Sâman at the Solasi (ceremony). For the Gauri vitam is beauty and acquirement of sacred knowledge. He who having such a knowledge uses the Gaurivitam as (the proper Saman at the Şolasi ceremony) becomes beautiful and acquires sacred know ledge. 

" They say, the Nanadam + ought to be used as (the proper) Sâman at the Solasi (ceremony). Indra lifted his thunderbolt to strike Vritra; he struck him with it, and, hitting him with it, killed him. He, after having been struck dowri, made a fearful noise (vyanadat). Thence the Nânada Sâman took its origin, and therefore it is called so (from nad to scream). This Sâman is free from enemies; for it kills enemies. "He who having such a knowledge uses the Nânada Sâman at the Solasi (ceremony) gets rid of bis enemies, (and) kills them. 

If they use the Nânadam (Sâman), the several padas of verses in two metres at the Solaśi Sastra are not to be taken out of their natural 

This is Indra juşasva pra vaha (San. Sanh. 2, 302-304). These verses are not to be found in the Rigveda Samhita, but in Asv. Sr. S. 6, 2. 

« This is praty asmai pipishate (San. Samh, 2, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4).

connection to [2581 join one pada of the one metre to one of the other (avihrita). For the Sâma singers do the same, using verses which are not joined in the vihrita way for singing the Nânada Sâman. 

If they use the Gauriritam, several padas of verses in tro metres used at the Solasi are to be taken out of their natural connection, to join one pada of the one metre to one of the other (vilpita). For the Såma singers do the same with the verses which they use for singing. 

The Way in which the Padas of Two Different letres are Vized in the 

Solaśí Sastra is Shown.) Then (when they use the Gaurivîti Sâman) the Hotar changes the natural position of the several padas of two different metres, and mixes them (vyatişajatz). He mixes thus Gayatris and Parktis, & två vahantu (1, 16, 1-3), and upa şu śrinuhi (1, 82, 1-3-4). ? Man has the nature of the Gâyatri, [259] and cattle that of the Pankti. (By thus mixing together Gayatri ard Paukti verses) the Hotar mixes man among cattle, and givea him a firm footing among them in order to become possessed of them). 

As regards the Gâyatri and Pankti, they both form two Anuştubhs (for they contain as many padas, viz., eight, as both Gâyatri and Parkti taken together). By this means, the sacrificer becomes neither separated from the nature of Speech which exists in form of the Anustubh, nor from the nature of a weapon (Speech being regarded as such a one). 

He mixes verses in the Uşņih and Brihati metres, yad indra prita. ndjye (8, 12, 25-27) and ayam te astu haryata (3, 44, 1-3). Man has the nature of Uşņih, and cattle that of Bțihati. (By thus mixing together Uşņih and Brihati verses) he mixes man among cattle, and gives him a 

firm footing among them. 

• All the words from "the several padas" to "other" are only & translation of the term aviðrita, in order to make it better understood. 

* The reason of this is, that the recitations of the Hotri-priest must correspond *with the performances of the Säma singers. 

"Say. shows the way in which the metres are mixed in the two verses : (Gayatrî) inici dhånd glaritasnuvo hari ihopa vakşatah indram sukhutame rathe (1, 16, 2). (Pankti) susandrıśam två vayam maghavan vandişimahi. 

pra núnam pár napandhurah stuto yahi viśán anu yojanvindra to narz. 

The Gayatri has three, the Panktî five feet (padas), each consisting of eight sylla bles. The two padas which the Panktî has in excess over the Gayatrî, follow at the end without any corresponding Gayatri pada. After the second pada of the Pankti, there is the pranuva made (i e., the syllable om is pronounced), and, likewise, after the fifth. The two verses, just mentioned, are now mixed as follows: ima dhana ghritasnuvah susaindrisan två vayan hart ihopa vaksato maghavan vandigimahom indram sukhatame rathe pro münan päritavardhurall stuto yahi višan anu yojanvindra to karom. 

176 

As regards the Uşnih and Brihati, they both form two Anustubhs. By this means the sacrificer becomes neither separated, &c. 

vipâd (verse of two padas only) and a Tristubh, a Zhang asma (7, 34, 4), and brehman Uta (7, 29, 2). Man is depđdia 2.6., has two feet, and strength is Triştubh. (By thus mixing a Dvipad and Triştubh), he mixes man with Strength (provides him with it) and makes him a footing in it. That is the reason that man, as having pre pared for him a footing in Strength, is the strongest of all animals. The Dvipâdv erse consisting of twenty syllables, and the Triştubh (of forty four), make two Anustubhs (sixty-four syllables). By this means, the sacrificer becomes neither separated, &c. 

He mixes Dvipadas and Jagatis, viz., eşa brahmarya hitvyam (Abv. Sr. S. 6, 2) and pra te mahe [260] 10, 96, 1-3). (Man is Dvipad, and animals have the nature of the Jagati. (By thus mixing Dvipâd and Jagati Terses) he mixes man among cattle, and makes him a footing among them. That is the reason that man, having obtained a footing among cattle, eats (thern) and rules over them, for they are at his disposal. 

As regards the Dvipâd verse consisting of sixteen syllables and the Jagati (consisting of forty-eight), they both (taken together) contain two Anuştubhs. By this means, the sacrificer, &c. 

He repeats verses in metres exceeding the number of padas of the principal metres, o viz., trikadrukeșu mah işo (2, 22, 1-3), and proşvas mai puro ratham (10, 133, 1-3). The juice which was flowing from the metres, took its course to the atichhandas. Thence such metres are called atichhandas, (i, e., beyond the metre, what has gone beyond, is in excess). 

This Solasi Sastra being formed out of all metres, he repeats verses in the Atichhandas metre. 

Thus the Hotar makes (the spiritual body of) the sacrificer consist of all metres. 

* These verses are not to be for nd in the Rigveda Samhita. I, therefore, write them out from my copies of the Âśval. Sutras : 

एष ब्रह्मा य ऋत्विय | इन्द्रो नाम श्रुतो गृणे ॥ 

विस्त्र तयो यथा पथ । इन्द्र त्वद्यन्ति सतयः ।। , afhanga lara fara gua || 

* That atti" he eats," put here without any object, refers to * pašavah," animals, fol lows with certainty from the context. Say, supplies ksira, milk, &c., for ho abhorred the 

idea that animal food should be thus explicitly allowed in a sacred text. 

. Thus I have translated the term atichhandasan i.e., having excess in the metro, The verses mentioned contain seven padas or feet, which exceeds the number of feet of all other metres. 

He who has such a knowledge prospers by means of the Solasi consisting of all metres. 

[ 261] (The Upasargas iaken from the Mahånâmnis. The proper 

Anuştubhs. Consequences of Repeating the Soļaśí Sastra in the Vihrita and Avihrita way. The Yajya of the Soļasî Sastro.) 

He makes the additions" (upasarga), taking (certain parts) from the Mandnämni verses - The first Malânâmni (verse) is this world (the earth), the second the zir, and the third that world (heaven). In this way, the Solasi is made to consist of all worlds. 

By adding parts from the Vahånâmnis (to the Șolasi), the Hotar makes the sacrificer participate in all worlds. He who has such a knowledge, prospers by means of the Soļasî being made to consist of all the worlds. 

- He repeats (now) Anustubhs of the proper form,12 viz., pra pra vas trîştubhan (8, 58, 1), archata prârckata (8, 58, 8-10), and yo vyatīär aphầnayat (8,58, 13-15). 

. [ 262 ] That the Hotar repeats Anuştubhs of the proper form (after having obtained them only in an artificial way) is just as if a man, after having gone here and there astray, is led back to the (right) path. 

He who thinks that he is possessed (of fortune) and is, as it were, sitting in fortune's lap (gataśrar), should make his Hotar repeat the şolasi in the avihrita way, lest he fall into distress for the injury done to the metres (by repeating them in the viłrita way). 

. But if one wishes to do away with the consequences of guilt (to get out of distress and poverty), one should make the Hotar repeat the Solasi in the vihrita way. 

11 These additions are called upasargas, They are five in namber, and mentioned by Âsv. 6, 2. They are all taken from different verses of the so-called Mahânämnis, com mencing with faci faatan TIT which make up the fourth Aranyaka of the Aitareya Brâhm. These five upasargas make together one Anuştubh. They are: (1) staaa (2) taaa 3) Frane fa #ta. (4) Acre za e (5) agraf a ater. Their application is different according to the avihrita or vihrita way of repeating the Solasi Sastra. If the Sastra is to be repeated in the former way, they are simply repeated in the form of one perse, after the recital of the Atichhandas verses. But if it be repeated in the vihrita way, the several upacargas are distributed among the five latter of the six Atichhandasa verses, in order to bring the bamber of syllables of each such verse to sixty-four, to obtain the two Anastubbs for each 

12 As yet the Apustubhs were only artificially obtained by the combination of the padas of different other metres. 

178 

For (in such cases) man is, as it were, intermixed with the conse quences of guilt (with the papman). By thus repeating the Soladi in the vihrita way, the Hotar takes from the sacrificer all sin and guilt. He who has such a knowledge becomes free from (the consequences of) guilt. 

With the verse ud yad bradhnasya vistapam (8, 58, 7) he concludes. For the celestial world is the "bradhnasya vistapam." Thus he makes the sacrificer go to the celestial world, 

As Yâjyâ verse he repeats apah purveşam harivaḥ (10, 96, 13).13 By repeating this verse as Yajyê (of the Solasî Sastra) he makes the Solaši to consist of all libations (savanani). The term apâh, thou hast drunk (used in this verse) signifies the Morning Libation. Thus he makes the Solasi to consist of [ 268 ) the Morning Libation. The words atho idam saranan kevalam te, i.e., this libation here is entirely thy own, signifies the Midday Libation. Thus he makes the Solasi to consist of the Midday Libation. The words, manaddhi somam, i.e., enjoy the Soma, signify the Evening Libation, which bas its characteristic the term mad, to enjoy, to be drunk. Thus be makes the Solasi to consist of the Evening Libation. The word vrişan, i.e., bull (contained in the last pada), is the characteristic of the Solasi. 

By repeating as Yâjyà (for the şolasi); the verse just mentioned, the Solasi is made to consist of all Libations. Thus he makes it to consist of all Libations. He who has such a knowledge prospers through the Solace, which consists of all Libations, 

(When repeating the Yajya) he prefixes to each of the four) pada, 14 consisting of eleven syllables, an upasarga of five syllables (taken) from the Mahâvâmnīs. Thus he makes the Şolasî to consist of all metres. He who has such a knowledge prospers by means of the Solasi, which is made to consist of all metres. 

13 The whole of the verse is as follows: 

अपाः पूर्वेषां हरिवः सुतानामथो इदं सवनं केवलं ते । 

ममद्धि सामं मधुमन्तमिन्द्र सत्रा वृषन् जठर आवृषस्व ॥ ie, “ Thou bast drunk, 0 waster of the two yellow horses (Indra)! of the Soma drops formerly prepared for thee. This libation here is entirely thy own (thou hast not to share it with any other god). Enjoy, 0 Indra! the honey-like Soma. O bull! increase thy strength by (receiving) all this (quantity of Soma) in (thy) belly. 

14 These four upasargas are : a) gaya b) qaret C) gab d) ART FT. 

They are thus prefixed : एवा ह्य वापा: पूर्वेषां एवहोन्द्राथो इदं० &c These T'pasargas a e preixed to the Yajya, in order to obtain two Anuştubhs (sixty-four syllables). 

179 

5. (Atirátra. Its origin. The three Paryayas.) The Devasis took shelter with Day, the Asuras with Night. They were thus of equal strength, and [ 264 ) none yielded to the other. Indra said, “Who, besides me, will enter Night to turn the Asnras out of it?" But he did not find any one among the Devas ready to accept (his offer), (for) they were afraid of Night, on account of its darkness being (like that of) Death. This is the reason that even now one is afraid of going at night even to a spot which is quite close. For Night is, as it were, Darkness, and is Death, as it were. The metres (alone) followed him. This is the reason that Indra and the metres are the leading deities of the Night (of the nightly festival of Atirâtra). No Nivid is repeated, nor a Puroruk, nor a Dhâyyâ; nor is there any other deity save Indra and the metres who are the leading (deities). They turned them out by going round (paryâyam) with the Paryayas (the different turns of passing the Soma cups). This is the reason that they are called paryâycz (from í to go, and pari around). 

By means of the first Paryâya they turned them out of the first part of the night; by means of the middle Paryâya out of midnight, and by means of the third Paryaya out of the latter part of the night. The metres said to Indra, "Even we (alone) are following (thee, to turn the Asuras) out of the Dark one (sarvard, night)." He (the sage Aitareya) therefore called them (the metres) apiśarvarâni, for they had Indra, who was afraid of the darkness of night (as) of death, safely carried beyond it. 

That is the reason that they are called upisarucâni, 

6. (The Sastras of Atiratra at the Three Paryayas. Sandhi Stotra.} 

The Hotar commences (the recitations at Atirâtra) with an Axüstubb verse containing the term andhas, i.e., darkness, viz., pántán a ro andhasara (8, 81, L.) [ 265 ] For night belongs to Anuştube; it has the nature of night. 

As appropriate Yâjyâ verse at the end of each turn of the three Paryayas) 16 Triştubhs containing the terms-andhas, darkness, pd to, drink, 

30 The same story with some trifing deviations in the wording only is reeorded in. the Gopatha Brahmaṇam of the Atharvaveda, 10, 1. 

16 There are four turns of the Soma cups passing the round in each Paryaya, or pair of the night, At the end of each, a Yajya is repeated, and the juice then sacrifieed. There is at each turn (there are on the whole twelve) a sastra repeated, to whica a Yajya De longs. The latter contains always the terms indicated. See, tor instance, the four Yájyås nged at the first Paryaya (åsv. śr. $, 0,4)iadłzvaryavo bhurata indriya, Lig 14, I. (repeated by the Hotar), In the second pada, there are the words, madyam andhalı, " the inebriating 

180 

and mad, to be drunk, are used. What is appropriate at the sacrifice, that is successful. 

The Sâma singers repeat when chanting at the first Paryâya twice the first padas only of the verses (which they chant). By doing so they take from them (the Asuras) all their horses and cows. 

At the middle Paryâya, they repeat twice the middle padas. By doing so, they take from them (the Asuras) their carts and carriages. 

At the last Paryâya, they repeat twice when chanting the last padas, (of the verses which they chant). By doing so, they take from them (the Asuras) all things they wear on their own body, such as dresses, gold and jewels. 

He who has such a knowledge deprives his enemy of his property, (and) turns him out of all these worlds (depriving him of every firm footing). 

[286] They ask, How are the Pavamâna Stotras 17 provided for the night, whereas such Stotras refer only to the day, but not to the night ? In what way are they both made to consist of the same parts (to have the same number of Stotras and Sastras) ? 

The answer is, (They are provided for) by the following verses, which form part of the Stotras as well of the Sastras (at the Atirâtra): indraya madvane sutam (8, 81, 19. Sâmaveda Samh. 2, 72), idam sao sutam andhah (8, 2, 1, Sâm. S. 2, 84), idam hyanvojasâ sutam (3, 51, 10. Sâm, S. 2, 87). In this way, the night becomes also provided with Pavamanas (for the verges mentioned contain the term suta, i.e., squeezed, referring to the squeezing of the Soma juice, which term is proper to the Pavamâna Stotra); in this way, both (day and night) are provided with Pavamânas, and made to consist of the same (number of) parts. 

They ask, As there are fifteen Stotras for the day only, but not for 

darkness" (symbolical name of the Soma juice). The Yajya of the Maitråvarupa is, asya made puruvarpaisi 8, 44, 14). It contains the term made, “to get drunk," and på, "to drink," in the last pada The Yajyå of the Bråbmandchhansî is åpsu dhūtasya harivah piba (10, 104, 2). This verse contains both the terms pá, “ to drink" (in piba of the first pada), and mad,“ to be drunk" (in the last pada). The Yájyå of the Achha väka is, indra piba tubhyam (6, 40, 1). It contains both the terms, pa, and mad. The Yajya of the Hotar in the second Paryaya is, apâyyasyândhaso madaya (2, 10, 1) ; it contains all three terms, * darkness, to drink, and to be drunk." 

17 This question refers to the Stotras to be chanted for the purification of the Soma juice, which are, at the morning libation, the Bahis-pavamâna, at midday, the Pavamana, and in the evening, the Arbhava-payamana. At night, there being no squeezing of the Soma, juice, there are, properly speaking, no Pavamâna Stotras required. But to make the per formance of day and night alike, the Pavamâna Stotras for day and night are to be indi cated in one way or other in the Stotras chanted at night. This is here shown. 

181 

the night, how are there fifteen Stotras for both (for day as well as for night) ? In what way are they made to consist of the same (number of) 

parts ? 

The answer is, The Apiśarvaras 18 form twelve Stotras. Besides) they chant, according to the Rathantara tune, the Sandhi 19 Stotra which contains [ 267 ] (three sets of) verses addressed to three deities. In this way, night comprises (also) fifteen Stotras. Thus both day and night) comprise each fifteen Stotras. Thus both are made to consist of the same (number of) parts. 

The number of verses for making the Stotras is limited, but the number of recitations which follow the Stotras) is unlimited. The past is, as it were, limited, defined ; the future is, as it were, unlimited (not defined). In order to secure the future (wealth, &c.,) the Hotar repeats more verses (than the Sâma singers chant). What goes beyond the Stotra is offspring, what goes beyond one's self (represented by the Stotra), is cattle. By repeating, when making his recitation, more verses (than the Sâma singers chant) the Hotar acquires all that he (the sacrificer) has beyond his own self on this earth (i.e., all his cattle, children, fortune, &c.) 

18 See 4, 5. They are the metres used for Sastras and Stotras during the night of Atiratra. 

19 This Stotra which is chanted after the latter part of the night is over, when the dawn is commencing (thence it is called samdhi, i.e., the joining of night and day), consists of six verses in the Brihati metre, with the exception of the two last which are kalubha (a variety of the Brihatî). They are put together in the Samay, Samh. 2, 99-104. The two frst of them, ena vo ägnim (2, 99-100) are addressed to Agni, the third and fourth, pratyu adarśy ayatyú (101-102) to Usås, and the fifth and sixth, imâ u vám divistaya (103-104) to the Asvins. The Stoma required for singing it, is the triurit parivarttini (see page 237). Two verses are made three by means of the repetition of the latter padas. This Sâman is chanted just like the verses of the Rathantaram, which are in the same metre It follows throughout the musical arrangement of the Rathantaram. The musical accents, the cres cendos, and decrescendos, the stobhas, l. 2., musical flourishes, and the finales (nidhana) are the same. Both are for the purpose of chanting equally divided into five parts, vien, - Prastáva, Udgitha, Pratihara, Upad rava, and Nidhana (see page 198). For instance, the Prastáva or prelude commences in both in the low tone, and rises only at the last syl lable (at mo in the nonumo of the Rathantaram, and at the so in the namaso of the first Bandhi Stotra); at the end of the Prastáva of both there is the Stobha, i.e., flourish va. At the end of the Upadrava both have the Stobhas va háziva. The finale is in both through out, as, in the rising tone.--(8áma prayoga and Oral information.)182

SECOND CHAPTER. (The Aśvina Sastra. The Beginning Day of the Gavam Ayanan. 

The Use"of the Rathantara and Brihat Sâmans and their kindreds. The Mahâurata Day of the Sattra.)! 

i The “Asvin Sastra is one of the longest recitations by the Hotar it is only a modification of the Prâtaranuvâka. Its principal parts are the same as those of the Prätaranuvika, the Agneya kratu, Uşasya kratu and Ašvina Icratu (see page 111), i,en, three series of hymns and verses in seven kinds of metre, addressed to Agni, Uşás, and the Asvins, which deities rule at the end of the night, and at the very commencement of the day. In addition to these three scratus of the Pratarapuvaka, in the Asvina sastra. there are verses addressed to other deities, chiefly the sun, repeated. Before commenc ing to repeat it, the Hotar (not the Adhvaryu) must sacrifice thrice a little melted butter, and eat the rest of it. These three oblations are given to Agni, Usås, and the two Asvins. Each is accompanied with a Yajus-like mantra That one addressed to Agui is : afarat e r a aah ah an* F# HIAAT AF FATET I Agni is driving with the Gayatri metre (this metre being his ca rriage), might I reach him ; I hold him; may this (melted butter) help me to him ; Svâhâ to him." The mantras repeated for the Ajya offerings to Uşas and the Aśvins differ very little. 

उषा अज्विनी त्रैष्टुभेन छन्दसा तामाश्यां तामन्वारभे तस्यै मामवतु तस्यै स्वाहा । अश्विनावविना mida harakai aleanca arazyf Alipad aizzi II. (Âbv. br. 8. 6, 5.) After having eaten the rest of the melted butter, he touches water only, but does not rinse his mouth in the usual way (by üchamana). He then sits down behind his Daisya (bre-place) in a peculiar posture, representing an eagle who is just about flying up. He draws up his two legs, pats both his knees close to each other, and touches the earth with his toes. I saw a priest, who had once repeated the Asvin sastra (there are . scarcely more than half a dozen Brahmans living all over India who actually have repeated it), make the posture with great facility, but I found it dificult to imitate it woll. 

The whole Asvina Sastra comprises a thousand Brihatî verses. The actual num ber of verses is, however, larger. All verses in whatever metre they are, are reduced to Brihatis by counting their aggregate number of syllables and dividing them by 38 (of so many syllables consists the Brihati). The full account is cast up in the Kauşîtaki Brâhmapam, 18, 3. 

The first verge of the Sastra is mentioned in the text. It is to be repeated thrice and to be joined, without stopping, to the first verse of the Gayatri part of the Agneya, kratu (gara. Traghag ÀŚy, śr. . 6. 5). After the opening verse which stands by itself altogether, just as the opening verse in the prátaranayaka, the three kratus or liturgies of the Prâtaranuváka (agneya, uşasya, and aspani) are repeated. These form the body of the Asvin' Sastra. Hach kratu is preceded by the Stotriya Pragatha, i.e., that couple of yerses of the Sandhi Stotra (see page 266) which refers to that deity, to which the respective krati is devoted. So the agneya kratu, i.e., the series of hymns and verses, addressed to Agni, in seven different kinds of metre, is preceded by the first couple of verses of the Sandhi Stotra, which are, ena vo agnim namaså (Såm. Banh, 2, 99-100); the uşasya kratu is preceded by praty u adarsy ayati (Sâm. Samh. 2, 101, 102), the deity being Uşas, and the áśvina-leratu by ima u vam diviştaya (Sam, Samh.my 103-104) being addressed to the two Asvins. Each couple of these verses is to be made a 

183 

[289] 7. (The Marriage of Prajâpati's Daughter, Sürya. The Asvina Sastra uas the Bridal Gift. In What Way the Hotar has to Repeat it. Its Begin ning Verse.) 

Prajâ pati gave his daughter, Sûrya Savitri, '.in[270]marriage to the king Soma. All the gods came as paranymphs. Prajapati formed, accord ing to the model of a vahatu, i.e., things (such as turmeric, powder, &c., to be carried before the paranymphs), this thousand (of verses), which is called the Asvina (Sastra). What falls short of (arvak) one thousand verses, is no more the Asvin's. This is the reason that the Hotar ought to repeat only a thousand verses, or he might repeat more. He ought to eat ghee before he commences repeating. Just as in this world a cart or a carriage goes well if smeared (with oil), thus his repeating proceeds well if he be smeared (with ghee, by eating it.) Having taken the posture of an eagle when starting up, the Hotar should recite (when commencing) the call somsavom (i.e., he should commence repeating the Afvina Sastra). 

The gods could not agree as to whom this (thousand verses) should belong, each saying, "Let it be mine." Not being able to agree (to whom it should belong), they said, " Let us run a race for it. He of us who will be the winner shall have it." They made the sun which is above Agni, the horise-father (above the Gârhapatya fire), the goal. That is the reason that the Asvina Sastra commences with a verse addressed to 

· Agni, viz., agnir hotâ grihapatih (6, 15, 13). triplet, by repeating the last pada several times, just as the Sama singers do. 

(बाहतात्रयस्तृचा:। स्तोनिया : प्रगाथा वा तान्पुरस्तादनुदैवतं स्वस्य छन्दसो बधा स्तुतं शंसत 

(đố v, 6, 5). The Hotar must repeat less than a thousand verses before sunrise : FEBIEHACAT: After sunrise, he repeats the verses addressed to Sürya, which all are mentioned in the Aitareya Brâhmagam, as well as all other remaining verses of the Asvina Sastra. The whole order of the several parts of this Sastra is more clearay stated in the Kusitaki Brahm. (18,2), than in the Aitareya. "The verses addressed to Indra follow after the Sürya verses (4, 10). At the end of the Sastra, there are two Puronuvákyås and two Yajyás, for there are two Asvins. 

The Aấvina Sastra is, as one may see from its constituent parts, a Pratara nuvāka, or early morning prayer, including the worship of the rising sun, and a sastra accon panying a Soma libation. It follows the Sandhi Stotra at the end of the Atiratra, and is regarded as the sastra belonging to this Stotra. To the fact of its containing far more verses than the Sandhi Stotra, the term atisařsati, i.e. "he repeats more versos" 

(used in 4, 6) refers. 

2 This is the model marriage. It is described in the well-known marriage hymn satyenottabhitá (10, 85). 

; . That is to say, they started when running the race from the Gârbapatya fire, and can up as far as the sun, which was the goal (kâştioa). 

184 

According to the opinion of some (theologians), the Hotar should in stead of this verse) commence (the recitation of the Asvina Sastra) with agnim manye pitaram (10, 7, 3); for they say, he reaches the goal by means of the first verse through the words (contained in its fourth pada): divi śukram yajatam súryasya, i.e., the splendour of the sun in heaven which deserves worship. But this opinion is not to [271] be attended to. (If one should observe a Hotar commencing the Asvina Sastra with the verse agnim manaye) one should say to him, “ If (a Sastra) has been com menced with repeatedly mentioning agni * fire, the Hotar will (ultimately fall into the fire (be burnt by it).” Thus it always happens. Thence the Hotar ought to cominence with the verse : agnir hotâ grihapatiḥ. This verse contains in the terms grihapati, house-father, and janima, generations, the propitiation (of the word agni, fire, with which it commences, and is therefore not dangerous) for attaining to the full age. 

He who has such a knowledge attains to his full age (of one hundred years). 

8. (The Race Run by the Gods for Obtaining the Asvina Sastra as a Prize.) 

Among (all) these deities who were running the race, Agni was with his mouth (the flames) in advance of all others) after they had started. The Asvins (closely) followed him, and said to him, "Let us both be winners of this race." Agni consented, under the condition that he should also have a share in it (the Asvina Sastra). They consented, and made room also for him in this (Aøvina Sastra). This is the reason that there is in the Asvina Sastra a series of verses addressed to Agni. 

The Asvins (closely) followed Uşâs. They said to her, “Go aside, that we both may be winners of the race." She consented, under the condition that they should give her also a share in it (the Abvina Sastra), They consented, and made -room also for [ 272 ] her in it. This is the reason that in the Asvina Sastra a series of verses is addressed to Uşas. 

The Asvins (closely) followed Indra. They said to him, "Maghavan, we both wish to be winners of this race." They did not dare to say to him, "Go aside." He consented, under the condition that he should also obtain a share in it (the Asvina Sastra). They consented, and made room also for him. This is the reason that in the Advina Sastra there is a series of verses addressed to Indra. 

Thus the Asvins were winners of the race, and obtained (the prize). This is the reason that it (the prize) is called Asvinam (i. e., the Asvina 

2 The verse in question contains four times the word agni. This is regarded as inauspicious. The deity should not be always mentioned with its very name, but with its epitheth. ' 

185 

Sastra). He who has such & knowledge obtains what he may wish 

for. 

They ask, Why is this (Sastra) called Asvinam, notwithstanding there being in it verses addressed to Agni, Uşâs, and Indra? (The an swer is) the Asvins were the winners of this race, they obtained it (the prize). This is the reason that it is called the Asvina Sastra. He who has such a knowledge obtains what he may wish for. 

(What Animals were Yoked to the Carriages of the Gods when they were Running the Race for the Ašvina Sastra. The Verses Addressed to Surya in this Sastra.) 

Agni ran the race, with a carriage drawn by mules. When driving them he burnt their wombs; thence they do not conceive. 

Uşâs ran the race with cows of a reddish colour, thence it comes that after the arrival of Uşas (Dawn), there is a reddish colour shining as it were (spread over the eastern direction) which is the characteristic of Uşas. 

[273] Indra ran the race with a carriage drawn by horses. Thence a very noisy spectacle (represented by the noise made by horses which draw a carriage) is the characteristic of the royal caste, which is Indra's. 

The Ašvins were the winners of the race with a carriage drawn by donkeys; they obtained (the prize). Thence (on aceount of the excessive efforts to arrive at the goal) the donkey lost its (original) velocity, became devoid of milk, and the slowest among all animals used for drawing carriages. The Asvins, however, did not deprive the sperm of the ass of rits (primitive) vigour. This is the reason that the male ass (vd jt) has two kinds of sperm (to produce mules from a mare, and asses from a female ass). 

Regarding this (the different parts which make up the Asvina Sastra), they say, “The Hotar ought to repeat, just as he does for Agri, Uşds, and the Asvins also, verses in all seven metres for Sûrya. There are seven worlds of the gods. (By doing so) he prospers in all (seven) worlds." 

This opinion ought not to be attended to. He ought to repeat (for Sürya) verses in three metres only. For there are three worlds which are three-fold. (If the Hotar repeats for Sürya verses in three metres only, this is done) for obtaining possession of these worlds. 

Regarding this (the order in which the verses addressed to Sürya **are to be repeated), they say, " The Hotar ought to commence (his recitation 

186 

. of the Sarya verses) with ud u tyam jätavedasan (1, 50, in the Gayatri 

metre)." But this opinion is not to be attended to. (To commence with this verse) is just as to miss the goal when running. Ho ought to commence with suryo no divas påtu (10, 158, 1, in the Gâyatrî metre). (If he do so) he is just as one who reaches the goal when running. He repeats: ud u tyan as the second hymn. 

[274] The Tristubh hymn is, chitram devánam ud agad (1, 115). For that one (the sun) rises as the chitram devândm, i.e., as the mani. festation of the gods. Thence he repeats it. 

The hymn is, namo mitrasya varuṇasya (10, 37). In this (hymn) there is a pada (the fourth of the first verse, súryaya samsata) which contains a blessing (âsîh). By means of it, the Hotar imparts a blessing to himself, as well as to the sacrificer. 

10. (The Verses which Follow those Addressed to Sürya in the Ašvina Sastra 

Must Bear some Relation to Surya and the Brihati Metre. The Pragathas to Indre. The Text of the Rathantara Saman. The Pragatha to Mitro parund. The Two Verses to Heaven and Earth. The Dvipada for Nirriti.) 

Regarding this (the recitations for Sûrya), they say, Sûrya is not to be passed over in the recitation; nor is the Brihati metre (of the Asvina Sastra) to be passed over. Should the Hotar pass over Sûrya, he would fall beyond (the sphere of) Brahma splendour (and consequently lose it). Should he pass over the Brihati, he would fall beyond the (sphere of the) vital airs and consequently die). 

He repeats the Pragâtha, addressed to Indra, viz., indra kratum na (7, 32, 26), i.e., "Carry, O Indra! our (sacrificial) performance through, just as a father does to his sons (by assisting them). Teach us, O thou who art invoked by many, that we may, in this turn (of the night) reach alive the (sphere of) light." The word “light” (jyotis) in this verse, is [275] that one (the sun). In this way, he does not pass over the sun. 

By repeating a Bârbata Pragatha he does not pass over the Bșihati. By repeating the principal text of the Rathantara Sâman (which is in the Brihati metre, viz., abhi två súra, 7, 32, 22-23), according to whose tune 

* This verse evidently refers to the Atirâtra feast, for which occasion it was in all likelihood composed by Vasiştha. Sây., in his commentary on this passage in the Ait. Br. takes the same view of it. It forms part of the Asvina Sastra which is repeated at the end of the night. Kratu means the Atirátra feast; for Atiratra is actually called a kratu ; yaman is the last watch of the night. That Atiratra was well-known to the great Rişis, we may learn from the well-known “praise of the frogs" (1, 103), which is by no means one of the latest hymns, as some scholars have supposed. 

187 

the Sama singers chant the Sandhi Stotra for the Asvina Sastra, he does, botoverpraise the Brihati. This is done in order to have provided (for the Sandhi Stotra) its principal text (lit., its womb). In the words of the Rathantara Sâman, isanám asya jagatah svardrišam, i.e., the ruler of this world who sees the sky, there is an allusion made to Sûrya by“ svardrisan," 2.e., who sees the sky. By repeating it, he does not pass the sun. Nor does he by its (the Rathantaram) being a Bârhata Pragatha pass over the Brihati. 

He repeats & Maiträvaruņa Pragâtba, viz., bahavaḥ śúrachakşase (7, 66, 10). For Mitra is the day, and Varuņa the night. He who, performs the Atira tra, commences (his sacrifice) with both day and night. By repeating a Maitrâvaruņa Pragatha, the Hotar places the sacrificer in day and night. By the words surachakşase he does not overpraise Sûrya.. The verse being a Brihati Pragatha, he does not pass over the Brihati. 

He repeats two verses addressed to Heaven and Earth, viz., mani dyduh prithivi (1, 22, 13), and te hi dyâvá prithivi visvas ambhuva (1, 160, 1). Heaven and Earth are two places for a firm footing; Earth being the firm. footing here, and Heaven there in the other world). By thus repeating two verses [276] addressed to Heaven and Earth, he puts the sacrificer in two places on a firm footing. By the words, dero devi dharmand suryaḥ suchih (in the last pada of 1, 160, 1), i.e., “the divine brilliant Sârya passes regularly between the two goddesses (i.e., Heaven and Earth)," he does not pass over Sûrya. One of these verses being in the Gâyatri, the other in the Jagati, metre, which make two Brihatis, he does not pass over the Břihati. 

He repeats the Dripada verse : visvasya devi mrichayasya (not to be found in the Samhitâ, but in the Brâhmanam), i.e., may she who is the ruler of all that is born and moves (mrichaya) not be angry (with us), nor visit us (with destruction). They (the theologians) have called the Aévina. Sastra a funeral pile of wood (chitaidhú). For, when tbe Hotar is about to conclude (this Sastra), Nirriti (the goddess of destruction) is lurking with her cords, thinking to cast them round (the Hotar). (To prevent this) Brihaspati saw this Dvipada verse. By its words, "may she not be angry (with us), nor visit us (with destruction)," he wrested from Nirriti's hands her cords and put them down. Thus the Hotar wrests also from: the hands of Nirriti her cords, and puts them down when repeating this: Dvipadâ verse, by which means he comes off in safety. (He does so) for 

The Brihatî contains thirty-six syllables, the Gayatri twenty-four, and the Jarati forty-eight. Two Bțihatîs make seventy-two, and one Gayatri and Jagatî make together noventy-two syllables. 

188 attaining to his full age. He who has such a knowledge attains to his full age. By the words, mrichayasya janmanah, i.e., " what is born and mores," he does not pass over the sun in his recitation, for that one (the sun) moves (marchayati) as it were. - 

As regards the Dvipadâ verse, it is the metre corresponding to man (on account of his two padas, i.e., (277) feet). Thus it comprises all metres (for the two-legged man is using them all). In this way, the Hotar does not (by repeating the Dripada) pass over the Brihati. 

11. (The Concluding Verses of the Asvin Sastra. The Two Ydjyds of 

it. In What Metre They Ought To Be.) The Hotar concludes with a verse addressed to Brahmaņaspati. For Brahma is Brihaspati. By repeating such a verse he puts the sacrificer in the Brahma. He who wishes for children and cattle should conclude with, evä pitre piśvaderdya (4, 50, 6). For, on account of its containing the words, “O Brihaspati, might we be blessed with children and strong men, might we become owners of riches," that man becomes blessed with children, cattle and riches, and strong men, at whose sacrifice there is a Hotar, knowing that he must conclude with this verse in order to obtain this object wished for). 

He who wishes for beauty and acquirement of sacred knowledge ought to conclude with, brihaspate atiyad (2, 23, 15). Here the word ati, z. e., beyond, means that he acquires more of sacred knowledge than other men do. The term, dyumat (in the second pada), means "acquirement of sacred knowledge," and vibhati means, that the sacred knowledge shines everywhere, as it vere. The term didayat (in the third pada) means, that the sacred knowledge has been shining forth ( in the Brahmans). The term, chitra (in the fourth pada), means that the sacred knowledge is, as it were, apparent (chitram). 

He, at whose sacrifice there is a Hótár knowing that he must conclude with this verse, becomes 'endowed with sacred knowledge and famous for sanctity. Thence a Hotar who has such a knowledge ought to conclude with this Brahmanaspati verse. [278] By repeating it, he does not pass over the sun. The Trishțubh," when repeated thrice, comprises all metres. In this way, he does not pass over the Brihati (by repeating this Triştubh). 

He ought to pronounce the formula, Vauşat, along with a verse, 

* The verse brihaspate ati is in the Triştubh metre. On account of its being the Last verge of the Shastra, it is to be repeated thrice, 

189 

in the Gayatri, and one in the Triştubh metre. Gayatri is the Brahma, and Triştubh is strength. By doing so, he joins strength to the Brahma. ' 

He, at whose sacrifice there is a Hotar knowing that he in order to obtain the objects mentioned) must pronounce the formula, Varşat, * with a verse in the Gâyatri, and one in the Triştubh metre becomes ondowed with sacred knowledge and strength, and famous for sanctity. (The Triştubb verse is) aśvind vâyund yuvari (3, 58, 7); (the Gâyatri is) ubhd pibatam (1, 46, 15). 

(There is another way of pronouncing the formula Varışat.) 

He ought to pronounce the formula Varşat along with a verse in the Gâyatrī, and one in the Virat metre. For Gâyatri is Brahma, and Virât is food. By doing so, he joins food to the Brahma. 

He, at whose sacrifice there is a Hotar knowing that he must pronounce the formula Vauşat along with a verse in the Gayatri, and one in the Virâle metro, becomes endowed with sacred knowledge, and famous for sanctity and eats Brahma food (ie., pure food). Therefore, one who has such a knowledge ought to pronounce the formula Vazgat along with a verse in the Gayatri, and one in the Tristubh metre. They are, pra vâm andhamsi (7, 68, 2, Virât ) and ubha pibatam (1, 46, 15, Gâyatri). 

[2791 12. (The Chaturvimsa , Day of the Sacrificial Session, called Gavâm 

Ayanám.) On this dayło (which follows the Atïrätra ceremony) they celebrate 

* That is to say, he should then make the Yajyas; for only at that occasion the formula vaugat is pronounced 

* This is the name of a day, and a stoma, required at the Sattra or sacrifatal se sion, called the gavdm ayanam (see more about it, 4, 17). It lasts for a whole year of 860 days, and consists of the following parts : 1) The Atiratra at the beginning. 2) The Obaturvimba or beginning day; it is called in the Aitareya Br. árambha niya, In the Tagdya Br. (4, 2,) prayaniya. 3) The periods of six days* performance (Salakay son tinded during five months, so that always the four first salahas are Abhiplavas, and the fifth a Pristhya (see on these terms 4, 15-17). 4) In the sixth month, there are three Abhiplava Salabás, and one 'Pristhya Salaba. 5) The Abhijit day. 6) The three Svaraså man, days. 7) The Visuvan or central day which stands quite apart. 8) The thres Svarastman days again. 9) The Visvajít daje 10) A Pristhya Salahs, and threo Abhi plavas during four months continuously. 12) In the last month (the twelfth of the Sattra) there are three Abhiplavas, one Gostoma, one Ayustoma, and one Dasaratra (the ten days of the Dvadastha). 15) Tbo Mahávratu day, which properly conclades the performance; it corresponds to the Chaturvinsa at the beginning. 14) The con eluding Atiratra Ses As 7. Sr. &. 11, 7. 

10 Ahah, has, according to say, the technical meaning of the Soma ceremony, which is performed on every partioular day.of a sacrificial session, 

190 

the Chaturvimsa (Stoma). It is the beginning day (of the year during which the sacrificial session is to last). For by this day they begin the year, and also the Stomas and metres, and (the worship of) the deities. If they do not commence (the Sattra) on this day, the metres have no (proper) beginning and the (worship of the) deities is not commenced. Thence this day is called drambhaniya, i. e., the beginning day. On account of the Chaturviñsa (twenty-four-fold) Stoma being used on it, it is (also) called Chaturvinsa. There are twenty-four half months. (By beginning the Sattra with the Chaturvimáa Stoma, i.e., the chant, consisting [280] of twenty-four verses) they commence the year as divided into half-months. 

The Ukthya (performance of the Jyotistoma) takes place (on that day). For the ukthas (recitations) are cattle. (This is done) for obtaining cattle. 

This (Ukthya sacrifice) has fifteen Stotras and fifteen Sastras. 1 1 (These make, if taken together, one month of thirty days.) By (perform ing) this (sacrifice) they commence the year as divided into months. This (Ukthya sacrifice) has 360 Stotriya verses * as many as the year has days. By (performing) this (sacrifice) they commence the year as divided into days. 

They say, "the performance of this (first) 'day ought to be an Agniętoma. Agnistoma is the year. For no other sacrifice, save the Agniştoma, has kept (has been able to keep) this day (the performance of this day), nor developed its several parts (i.e., has given the power of performing all its several rites). 

Should they perform (on the beginning day) the Agniştoma, then the three Pavamâna Stotras 18 of the morning, midday, and evening libations are to be put in the Aştachatvarimsa Stoma (i.e., each of the Stotriya triplets is made to consist of forty-eight verses by means of repetition), and the other (nine) Stotras in, the Chaturvimsa Stoma. This makes (on the whole) 360 Stotriyas, as many as there are days (in the year). (By performing the Agniętoma in this way) they commence the year as divided into days. i : 

[281] The Ukthya sacrifice should, however, be performed (on the beginning day of the Sattra, not the Agniştoma). (For) the sacrifice is wealth in cattle, the Sattra is (also) wealth in cattle (and cattle is represent 

1. See page 234. 

12 Each of the Afteen Stotra triplets is made to consist of twenty-four verses by repetition, according to the theory of the Chaturviinsa stoma. 24 times 16 makes 360. 

*These are, the Bahiş-pavamana, the Pavamâna, and Arbhavapavamâna. 

191 

ted by the Ukthya). If all Stotras are put in the Chaturvimša Stoma (as is the case when the Ukthya is performed), then this day becomes actually throughout a Chaturviñía (twenty-four-fold). Thence the Ukthya sacri fice ought to be performed (on the beginning day of the Sattra). 

13. (on the Importance of the Two Samans, Rathantaram and Brihat. They are Not to be used at the Same Time. The Succession of the Sacrificial Days in the Second-Half of the Year is Inverted.) 

The two (principal) Sâmans at the Sattra are the Brihat and Rathan taram. These are the two boats of the sacrifice, landing it on the other shore (in the celestial world). By means of them, the sacrificers cross the year (just as one crosses a river). Brihat and Rathantara are the two feet (of the sacrifice); the performance of the day is the head. By means of the two feet, men gain their fortune (consisting of gold, jewels, &c.) which is to be put (as ornament) on their heads. 

Bribat and Rathantaram are two wings; the performance of the day is the head. By means of these two wings, they direct their heads to fortune, and dive into it. 

Both these Sâmaps are not to be let off together. Those performers of the sacrificial session who would do so, would be floating from one shore to the other (without being able to land anywhere), just as a boat, whose cords are cut off, is floating from shore to shore. Should they let off the Bathantaram, then, by means of the Brihat, both are kept. Should he let off [282] the Brihat, then, by means of the Rathantaram both are kept." (The same is the case with the other Sama Pristhas.) Vairûpam'* is 

14 This refers to the so-called Sama pristhas, i.e., combination of two different Såmans, in such a way, that one forms the womb (yoni), the other the embryo (garbha). This relationship of both Samans is represented by repeating that set of verses which form the womb in the first and third turns (paryayas) of the Stomas (see 237-38), and that one which is the embryo, in the second turn. In this way, the embryo is symbolically placed in the womb which surrounds it on both sides. The two Såmans which generally form the womb, are the Brihat and Rathantaran. Both are not to be used at the same time; but only one of them. Both being the two ships which land the sacrificer on the other shore (bring him safely through the year in this world), they cannot be sent ofi at the same time; for the sacrificer would thus deprive himself of his conveyance. One of them is tied to this, the other to the other shore. If he has landed on the other shore, he requires another boat to go back. For, before the end of the year, he cannot establish himself on the other shore, nor, as long as he is alive, on the shore of the celestial world. By going from one shore to the other, and returning to that whence he started, he obtains a fair knowledge of the way, and provides himself with all that is required for being received and admitted on the other shore after the year is over, or the life has berminated 

10 The Vairûpa Såma is, yadya va indra te satam (sâm. Samb. 2,21%-13).192 

the same as Brihat, Vairajale is the same as Brihat, Sakvaram'? is the same as Rathantaram, and Raiyatam 18 is the same as Brihat. 

Those who, having such a knowledge, begin the Sattra (sacrificial session) on this day, hold their (sacrificial) year in performing austerities, enjoying the Soma draught, and preparing the Soma juice, after having reached the year as divided into half-months, months, and days. 

[288] When they (those who hold the Sattra) begin the performance of the other part1' (of the sacrifice), they lay down their heavy burden, for the heavy burden (if they are not released) breaks them down. There -fore, he who, after having reached this (the central day of the yearly sacri ficial session) by means of performing the ceremonies one after the other, begins (the second part of the sacrificial session) by inverting the order of the ceremonies, arrives safely at the end of the year. - 

14. (On a Modification of the Nişkevalya Sastra on the Chaturvitsa and Mahâurata Days of the Sattra. 

This Chaturviṁsa day is (the same as) the Mahâvrata*(the Niş kevalya Sastra being the same as in the Mahâvrata sacrifice). By means of the Brihad-deva byman,*1 the Hotar pours forth the seed. Thus he makes the seed (which is poured forth) by means of the Mahâvrata day produce offspring. For seed if effused every - year is productive (every year). This is the reason that (in both parts of the Sattra) the [284) Brihad-deva hymn forms equally part of the Nişkevalya Sastra. 

He who having such a knowledge performs, after having reached the central day by performing the ceremonies one after the other, the 

** The Vairāja Sima is, piba somam indra mandatu (Sam. Samh. 2, 277-79). " The så vara sama is, pro şvasmái puroratham (8&m. Samh. 2, 9, 1, 14, 1-3). 18 The Raivata Sáma is, revatir nan sadhamáda (Sam. Samh.2, 434-36). 

** This sense is implied in the words, ata urdhvam, " beyond this," i, euy beyond the ceremonies commencing on the drambhaniya day of the Sattra. The first six months of the sacrificial session lasting all the yoar, are the first, the second six months the other turn; in the midst of both is the Visuvan day (see 4, 18. ), i. e, the equator. After that day the same ceremonies begin anew, but in an inverted order; that is to say, what was performed immediately before the Vişuvan day, that is performed the day after it, &c. 

** This sacrifice is described in the Aranyaka of the Rigveda. It refers to generation and includes, therefere, some very obscene rites. Its principal sastra is the Mahaduka tham, i, e, the great bastra, also called the Brihati sastra. The Mahâvrata forms part of a Battra. It is celebrated on the day previous to the concluding Atirktra, and has the same position and importance as the Chaturvinsa day after the beginning. Atiratra. The Brihad-deva hymn is required at the Nişkevalya sastra of both. But, instead of the Chaturvimśa Stoma, the Panchavimsa (twenty-five-fold) Stoma is used at the Maharat sacrifice.

He who knows this shore and that shore of (the stream of) the year, arrives safely on the other shore. The Atirâ tra at the beginning of the Sattra) is this shore of the year), and the Atirâtra at the end of the Sattra) is the other shore. 

He who has such a knowledge, arrives safely at the end of the year. He who knows how to appropriate the year (according to half-months, months, and days), and how to disentangle himself from it after having passed through it) arrives safely at the end of the year. The Atirâtra at the beginning is the appropriation, and that at the end is the disentangle ment. 

He who has such a knowledge, safely reaches the end of the year. He who knows the präna (air inhaled) of the year and its a pána (air ex haled) safely reaches the end of the year. The Atirá tra at the beginning is its prana, and the Atirå tra at the end its udâna (a pâna). He who has such a knowledge, safely reaches the end of the year.

THIRD CHAPTER. (The Şalaha and Vişuvan Day of the Sattras with the Performance of the Days Preceding and Following the Vişuvan.) 

15. (The Tryaha and Salaha, i. e, periods of three and six days at the Sattra. The Abhiplava.) 

They (those who hold the sacrificial session) perform [280] (now) the Jyotiz-Go and Ayuş-Stomas. This world is the Jyotis (light), the airy region the Go (Stoma), that world âyus (life). The same Stomas (as in the first three days out of the six) are observed in the latter three days. (In the first) three days (the order of the stomas is), Jyotişı Go and Ayuş Stomas. (In the latter) three days (the order is) Go-Ayus Jotis-Stomas. (According to the position of the Jyotiş Stoma in both parts) the Jyotis is this world and that world; they are the two Jyotiş (lights) on both sides facing (one another) in the world. 

They perform the Şaļaha (six days' Soma sacrifice), so that in both its parts (each consisting of three days) there is the Jyotis Stoma (in the first at the beginning, in the latter at the end). By doing so, they gain a firm footing in both worlds, in this one and that one, and walk in both, 

Abhiplava Şalaha? is the revolving wheel of the gods. Two Agnişa 

The Sattra is divided into periods of six days, of which period every month has five. Such a period is called a Salaha, i.e, six days' sacrificial work. The five times repetition within a month is abhiplava.

tomas form the circumference (of this wheel); the four Ukthyas in the midst are then the nave. By means of this revolving (wheel of the gods) one can go to any place one may choose. Thus he who has such a knowledge, safely reaches the end of the year. He who has a (proper) knowledge of the first Salaha safely reaches the end of the year, and so does he who has a (proper) knowledge of the second, third, fourth, and fifth Salahas, i.e., all the five Şaļahas of the month, 

16. (On the Meaning of the Celebration of Five Şaļahas during the Course 

of a Month. They celebrate the first Salaha. There are six seasons. This makes six days. Thus they secure [286] the year (for themselves) as divi ded into seasons, and gain a firm footing in the several seasons of the year. 

They celebrate the second Salaha. This makes (in addition to the previous six days) twelve days. There are twelve months. Thus they Becure the year as divided into months, and gain a firm footing in the several months of the year. 

They celebrate the third Şalaha. This makes (in addition to the previous twelve days) eighteen days. This makes twice nine. There are nine vital aire, and nine celestial worlds. Thus they obtain the nine vital airs, and reach the nine celestial worlds, and gaining a firm footing in the vital airs, and the celestial worlds, they walk there. 

They celebrate the fourth Salaha. This makes twenty-four days. There are twenty-four half-months. Thus they secure the year as divided into half-months, and, gaining a firm footing in its several half-months, they walk in them. 

They celebrate the fifth Şalaha. This makes thirty days. The Virâţ metre has thirty syllables. The Virâţ is food. Thus they procure virâț (food) in every month. 

Those who wished for food, were (once) holding a sacrificial session. By obtaining in every month the Virâ t (the number thirty), they become possessed of food for both worlds, this one and that one. 

17. (Story of the Sacrificial Session held by the Cows. Different kinds of the 

great Sattras, such as the Gavâm Ayanam, Adityanam Ayanam, and Angimasam Ayanam). 

They hold the Gavâm Ayanam, i.e., the sacrificial session, called '"cow's walk." The cows are the [287] Âdityas (gods of the months). By holding the session called the "cow's walk," they also hold the walk of the Adityas. 

195 

The cows being desirous of obtaining hoofs and horns, held (once) a sacrificial session. In the tenth month (of their sacrifice) they obtained hoofs and horns. They said, “We have obtained fulfilment of that wish for which we underwent the initiation into the sacrificial rites. Let us rise (the sacrifice being finished).” When they arose they had horns. They, however, thought, "let us finish the year," and recommenced the session. On account of their distrust, their horns went off, and they consequently became hornless (túpara). They (continuing their sacrificial session) produced vigour (ar)). Thence after (having been sacrificing for twelve months and) having secured all the seasons, they rose (again) at the end. For they had produced the vigour (to reproduce horns, hoofs, &c., when decaying). Thus the cows made themselves beloved by all (the whole world), and are beautified (decorated) by all.2 

He who has such a knowledge, makes himself beloved by every one, and is decorated by every one.. 

The Adityas and Angiras were jealous of one another as to who should (first) enter the celestial world, each party saying, "we shall first enter." The Adityas entered first the celestial world, then the Angiras, after (they had been waiting for) sixty years. 

(The performance of the sacrificial session called Adityanam ayanam agrees in several respects with the Gavâm ayanam). There is an Atirâtre at the beginning, and on the Chaturvimía day the Ukthya is [288]per formed; all the (five) Abhiplava Salahas are comprised in it; the order of the days is different, (that is to, say, the performance of the first, second days, &c., of the Abhiplava are different from those of the Gavâm ayanam). 

This is the Adityânâm ayanam, 

The Atirâ tra at the beginning, the Ukthya on the Chaturvimsa day, all (five) Abhiplava performed with the Prişthas, the performance of the ceremonies of the several days (of the Abhiplava) being different from the Gavâm ayanam, &c.): this is the Angirasâm ayanam. 

The Abhiplava Şalaha is like the royal road, the smooth way to heaven. The Prişthya Şalaha is the great pathway which is to be 

* It is an Indian custom preserved up to this day to decorate cows, chiefly on the birth-day of Krisha (Gokul aştamí). 

In the Gavám ayanam there are only four Abhiplava Şalabas; but in the Adityanam ayanam there are all five Abhiplava Şalahas required within a month. The last (@fth) Salaba of the Gayam ayanam is a Pristhya, that is, one containing the Pristhas. The difference between an Abhiplava Salaha, and a Prigthya Salaha, is, that during the latter, the Sama Přiştbas is required, that is to say, that on every day at the midday libation the Stomas are made with a combination of two different Sâmans in the way described above (page 282), whilst this is wanting in the Abhiplava,

trodden everywhere to heaven. When they avail themselves of both roads, they will not suffer any injury, and obtain the fulfilment of all desires which are attainable by both, the Abhiplava Şaļaha and the Pristhya 

Şalaba.4 . 

18. (The Ekavimsa or Vişuvan Day.) They perform the ceremonies of the Ekavimba day, which is the equator, dividing the year (into two equal parts). By means of the performance of this day, the gods had raised the sun up to the heavens. This Ekavinsa day on which the Divâkirtya mantra [289] (was produced), is preceded by ten days, 5 and followed by ten such days, and is in the midst (of both periods). On both sides, it is thus put in a Virâţ (the number ten). Being thus put in a Virâţ (in the number ten) on both sides, this (Ekaviṁsa, i.e., the sun) becomes not disturbed in his course through these worlds. 

The gods being afraid of the sun falling from the sky, supported him by placing beneath three celestial worlds to serve as a prop. The (three) Stomas. (used at the three Svarasâman days which precede the Vişuvan day) are the three celestial worlds. They were afraid, lest he (the sun) should fall beyond them. They then placed over him three worlds (also), in order to give him a prop from above. The (three) Stomas (used at the three Svarasâman days which follow the Vişuvan day) are the three worlds. Thus there are before (the Vişuvan day) three seventeen-fold Stomas (one on each of the preceding Svarasâman days), and after it (also), three seventeen-fold Stomas. In the midst of them there is the Ekavimsa day (representing the sun) held on both sides by the Svarasâman days. On account of his being held by the three Svarasämans (representing the three worlds below and the three above the sun) the sun is not disturbed in his course through these worlds. 

The gods being afraid of the sun falling down from the sky, support ed him by placing beneath the highest worlds. The Stomas are the highest worlds. 

The gods being afraid of his falling beyond them being turned 

* In the Gayam ayanam, both the Abhiplava Salaha and the Pristhya Salaha are required. Thence the sacrificers who perform the Gea vâm ayanam, avail themselves of both the roads leading to heaven. 

The ten days which precede the Ekavinsa are, the three Svarasamânah, Abhijit, and a $alana (a period of six days). The same days follow, but so, that Svarasâ mânah, which were the last three days before the Ekavinsa, are the first three days after that day, &c. 

Uustomas, see the noto to, 4.

upside down, supported him by [290] placing above him the highest worlds (also). The Stomas are the highest worlds. 

Now there are (as already mentioned) three seventeen-fold Stomas before, and three after (the Vişuyan day). If two of them are taken together, three thirty-four-fold Stomas are obtained. Among the Stomas the thirty-four-fold is the last. ? 

The sun being placed among these (highest worlds) as their ruler, burns with (his rays). Owing to this position, he is superior to every thing in creation that has been and will be, and shines beyond all tbat is in creation. (In the same way, this Vişuvan day) is superior (to all days which precede or follow). 

It is on account of his being prominent as an ornament, that the man who has such a knowledge, becomes superior (to all other men). 

19. (The Svarasámans. Abhijit. Visvajit. Vişuvan.) They perform the ceremonies of the Svarasâman days. These (three) worlds are the Svaras@man days. On account of the sacrificers pleasing these worlds by means of the Svarasâmans, they are called Svarasaman (from asprinvan, they made pleased). 

By means of the performance of the Svarasâman days, they make him (the sun) participate in these worlds. 

(291] The gods were afraid lest these seventeen-fold Stomas (employed at the Svarasâman days) might, on account of their being all the same, and not protected by being covered (with other Stomas), break down. Wishing that they should not slip down, they surrounded them, below with all the Stomas, and above with all the Prişthas. That is the reason that on the Abhijit day which precedes (the Svarasâman days) all Stomas are employed, and on the Visvajit day which follows (the Svaraså man days after the Vişuvan day is over) all Priştbas are used. These (Stomas and Pșişthas) surround the seventeen-fold Stomas (of the Svarasâman days), in order to keep them in their proper place) and to prevent them from breaking down. 

* This is not quite correct. There is a forty-eight-fold Stoma, besides. * See the Asval. Śr. S. 8, 5-7. 

* This etymology is certainly fanciful ; Svara cannot be traced to the root sprint, a modification of pri, to love. The name literally means, “The Sämans of the tones." This appears to refer to some peculiarities in their intonations. These Sämans being required only for the great Sattras, which have been out of use for at least a thousand years, it is difficult now to ascertain the exact nature of the recital of these Sämans. 

198 

(The Performance of the Vişuvan Day.) 10 The gods were (again) afraid of the sun falling from the sky. They pulled him up and tied him with five ropes. " The ropes are the Divâkirtya Såmans, 12 among which there is the Mahâdivâkirtya Priştha ; 13 the others are, the Vikarna, the Brahma, the Bhâsa, 14 and the Agnis toma 15 Sâma; [292] the Bțihat and Rathantara Samans are required for the two Pavamâna Stotras (the Pavamâna at the midday, and the Arbhava-pavamâna at the evening, libations). 

Thus they pulled up the sun, tying him with five cords, 16 in order to keep him and to prevent him from falling. 

(On this day, the Vişuvan) he ought to repeat the Prâtaranuvâka after the sun has risen ; for only thus all prayers and recitations belong ing to this particular day become repeated during the day-time (the day thus becomes divákirtyam). 

As the sacrificial animal belonging to the Soma libation (of that day) and being dedicated to the sun, they ought to kill such an one as might be found to be quite white (without any speck of another colour). For this day is (a festival) for the sun. *** 

He ought to repeat twenty-one Sâmidheni verses (instead of fifteen or seventeen, as is the case at other occasions); for this day is actually, the twenty-first (being provided with the twenty-one-fold Stoma). 

19 See the Âśval. śr. S. 8, 6. 11 The term is raśmi, ray, which Sây, explains by parigraha. 

12 Sây, explains the words by: faaa qaraaraa a ita i en the five Såmans which are to be repeated only at day. This explanation may appear at first somewhat strange, but it is quite correct. For the employment of the different tunes is regulated by the different parts of the day. Up to this time, certain tunes (råga, the word somana being only the older denomination for the same thing) are allowed to be chanted only at day, such as the Sáranga, Gauragáranga, &c., others are confined to the early morning, others to the night. 

13 This is the triplet vibhrad brihat pibatu (sam. Bank, 2, 802-804), 

** The Vikarşam Sama is, priksasya urişno (6, 8, 1). The same yerse is used, accord ing to say., for the Brahma, as well as for the Bhasa, såmans. 

15 The Agniętoma Sama is not especially mentioned by Sây. He simply says in the same manner in which the Pandits up to this day explain such things : 4T WIETHETAHEST 

ha aglagtHETH Now the Saman with which the Agnistoma becomes com pleted, i.e., the last of the twelve Stotras is the so-called Yajāà Yajõîya Sâman; yajua yajtá vo agnaye (Sim. Sam. 2, 53-54). This one is expressly called (in the Same prayogas) the Ågnistoma-sama, being the characteristic Såman of the Agniştoma. 

. 19 The ive tanes or Sâmans representing the five cords are, the Mahadivå kîrtyang the Vikarpa, Brahma, and Bhâsa tunes, being regarded only as one on account of their containing the same verse; the Agniştoma Sama, and the Brihat, and Rathantaram.

After having repeated fifty-one or fifty-two verses 17 of the Sastra (of this day), he puts the Nivid (addressed [293] to Indra) in the midst of the hymn indrasya nu veryâni, 1, 32). After this (the repetition of the Nivid) he recites as many verses (as he had recited before putting the Nivid, i, e., fifty-one or fifty-two). (In this way the total number of verses is brought to above a hundred.) The full life of man is a hundred years; he has (also) a hundred powers and a hundred senses. (By thus repeating above a hundred verses) the Hotar thus puts the sacrificer in the possession of his full) life, strength, and senses. 

20. (The Hamsavati Verse or the Tårkşya Triplet to be Repeated in the Dürohana way. Explanation of both the Hansavatî and Târkşya.) 

He repeats the Dûrohanam as if he were ascending (a height). For the heaven-world is difficult to ascend (dürohanam). He who has such a knowledge ascends to the celestial world. 

As regards the word dürohanam, that one who there burns (the sun) has a difficult passage up (to his place) as well as any one who goes there (i. e., the sacrificer who aspires after heaven). 

By repeating the Dürohanam, he thus ascends to him (the sun). 

He ascends with a verse addressed to the hamsa (with a hamsavati.)18 (The several terms of the (294) ham savati are now explained). This (Aditya, the sun) is “the swan sitting in light.” He is the “ Vasu (shining being) sitting in the air." He is the "Hotar sitting on the Vedi." 

11 The number fifty-one or fifty-two depends on the circumstance that of the Nivid hymn, indrasya nu viryani, either eight or nine yerses might be recited before the insertion of the Nivid. The rule is that at the midday libation the Nipid should be inser ted after the first half of the hymn has been exceeded by about one verse. The song in question has fifteen verses. The insertion can, therefore, not take place before the eighth, and not after the ninth. 

1 This verse forms the Darohang mantra. Its repetition is described by Asval. śr. 5. 8,2, in the followin way : 

श्राहय दूरोहणं रोहेद्वंसः शूचिषदिति पच्छोऽधर्चशस्त्रिपधाचतुर्थमनवानमुक्त्वा प्रणुत्यावस्येमुनस्त्रिय qua: 937 gen HAAGUIRU; i. e, after having called somsávon, he should repeat the verse hamsah suchísud (4, 40,5) in the Dúrohana way first by padas, then by half verses, then taking three padas together, and, finally, the whole verse without stopping, and conclude (this first repetition) with the syllable om. Then he ought to repeat it again, commencing with three padas taken together, then by half verses (and ultimately) by padas, which makes the seventh repetition (of the same verse). This is the Darohanan. See Ait. Br. 4, 21. The Maitråvaruņa has it to repeat always on the sixth day of the Abhiplaya şalahas. On the Vişuyan day it is repeated by the Hotar, The hamsavati fornis part of a hymn addressed to Dadhikrävan, which is a name of the sun; hamsa, i, eng swan, is another metaphorical expression for "sun." 

200 

He is the “guest sitting in the house." He is “sitting among men." He “sits in the most excellent place" (varasad), for that place, in which sitting, he burns, is the most excellent of seats. He is “sitting in truth" (ritasad). He is "sitting in the sky” (vyomasad), for the sky is among the places that one where sitting he burns. He is "born from the waters” (abja), for in the morning he comes out of the waters, and in the evening he enters the waters. He is "born from cows” (goja). He is "born from truth.” He is "born from the mountain” (he appears on a mountain, as it were, when rising). He is " truth” (ritam). 

He (the sun) is all these (forms). Among the metres (sacred verses) this (hamsavati verse) is, as it were, his most expressive and clearest form. Thence the Hotar should, wherever he makes the Dûrohanam, make it with the Hamsavati verse. 

He who desires heaven, should, however, make it with the Târkşya verse (10, 178, 1). For Târkşya showed the way to the Gâyatri when she, in the form of an eagle, abstracted the Soma (from heaven). When be thus uses the Tårkşya (for [295] making the Dûrohanam), he does just the same as if he were to appoint one who knows the fields as his guide (when travelling anywhere). The Târkşya 19 is that one who blows (i. e., the wind), thus carrying one up to the celestial world. 

The Târkşya hymn is as follows:-(1) " Let us call hither to (our) “safety the Târkşya, that horse instigated by the gods, (the horse) which "is enduring, makes pass the carriages (without any impediment), which “keeps unbroken the spokes of the carriage wheel, which is fierce in battle "and swift." 

He (the Târkşya) is the horse (vâ jt) instigated by the gods. He is enduring, makes pass the carriage (without any impediment); for he crosses the way through these worlds in an instant. He keeps the spokes of the carriage wheel unbroken, conquers in battle (pritanâja being explained by pritand jit). By the words, " to (our) safety," the Hotar asks for safety. By the words, "let us call hither the Târksya,” he thus calls him, 

(2) " Offering repeatedly gifts (to the Târkşya) as if they were for *Indra, let us for (our) safety embark in the ship (represented by the ** Dürohanam) as it were. (May) the earth (be) wide (to allow us free "passage). May we not be hurt when going (our way) through you two " (heaven and earth) who are great and deep (like an ocean).” 

** It is often identified with the Garuda, i. e., the celestial eagle. According to Naigh. 1, 14, it means "horse" Whether it is a personification of the sun, as is assumed in the Samskřit Dictionary of Boehtlingk and Roth, ili, page 310, is very doubtful to me 

201 

By the words, "for safety," he asks for safety. By the words, "let .. us embark in the ship," he thus mounts him (the Tarkssa), in order 

to reach the beavenly world, to enjoy it and to join the celestial [296] inhabitants). By the words, “ (may) the earth (be) wide, may we not be hurt," &c., the Hotar prays for a (safe) passage and (a safe) return.** 

(3) "He (the Târkşya) passes in an instant by dint of his strength " through the regions of all five tribes (z. e., the whole earth), just as the sun * extends the waters (in an instant) by its light. The speed of him (the “ Tarkşya) who grants a thousand, who grants a hundred, gifts, is as irre * sistible as that of a fresh arrow." 

By the word, szérya, he praises the sun openly. By the words, "the speed of him," &c., he asks for a blessing for himself and the sacrificers. 

21. (On the Way of Repeating the Dürohanan.) After having called sorsávom, he makes the Dûrohanam (represent ing the ascent to heaven). The celestial world is the Dîrohanam (for it is to ascend). Speech is the call sornsávom ; (Brahma is Speech). By thus calling somsávom, he ascends through the Brahma, which is this call, to the celestial world. The first time he makes his ascent by stopping after every pada (of the Dûrobana mantra). Thus he reaches this world (the earth). Then he stops after every half verse. Thus he reaches the airy region. Then he stops after having taken together three padas. Thus he reaches that world. Then be repeats the whole verse without stopping. 

Thus he gains a footing in him (the sun) who there burns. 

(After having thus ascended) he descends by stopping after three padas, just as one in this world) holds the branch of the tree (in his hand when [297] descending from it). By doing so, he gains a firm footing in that world. By then stopping after each half verse, he gains a firm foot ing in the airy region, and by stopping) after each pada (be gains a firm footing) in this world (again). After having thus reached the celestial world, the sacrificers obtain thus a footing (again) in this world. 21 

For those who aspire only after (a footing) in one (world), that is, 20 श्राच पराच मेष्यन् are explained by Say. as प्रागमिष्यन् and पुनरपि परावृत्य गमिष्यन्. 

31 One has to bear in mind that the sacrificer does not wish to reside permanently in heaven before the expiration of his full life-term, viz., one handred years. Bat by means of certain sacrifices he ean secure for himself, even when still alive, lodgings in heaven, to be taken up by him after death. He must already, when alive, mystically ascend to heaven, to-gain a footing there, and to be registered as a future inhabitant of the celestial world. After having accomplished his end, he descends again to the earth. His ascent and descent are dramatically represented by the peculiar way in which the Dürohana mantra is repeated. 

26202 

after heaven, the Hotar ought to repeat (the Dûrohanam) without making the descent (11 the way described, by stopping first after three padas, &c.) They (thus conquer only the celestial world, but they cannot stay long, as it were, in this world. 

Hymns in the Tristubh and Jagatî metre are mixed to represent a pair. For cattle are a pair; metres are cattle. (This is done) for obtaining cattle. " 

(To What the Vişuvan Day is like. Whether or not the Sastras of the 

Vişuvan Day are to be Repeated on other Doys during the Sattro also. On the Merit of Performing the Vişuvon Day. On this Day an Ox is to be Immolated for Viśvakarma.) 

The Vişuvan day is like a man. Its first half is like the right half (of a man) and its latter half like the left half. This is the reason that it (the performance [298] of the six-months' ceremonies following the Vişuvan day) is called the " latter" (half). 

The Vişuvan day is (just as) the head of a man whose both sides are equal."2 Man is, as it were, composed of fragments (bidala). That is the reason that even here a suture is found in the midst of the head. 

They say, He ought to repeat the recitation for) this day only on the Vişuvan day. 23 Among the Sastras this one is Visuvan. This Sastra (called) Vişuvan is the equator (vişuvan). (By doing so) the sacrificers become rişurat (2.e., standing like the head above both sides of the body) and attain to leadership, 

But this opinion is not to be attended to. He ought to repeat it (also) during the year (the Sattra is lasting). For this Sastra is seed. By doing so, the sacrificers keep their seed (are not deprived of it) during the year. . 

For the seeds produced before the lapse of a year which have required (for their growth) five or six months, go off (have no productive power). The sacrificers will not enjoy them (the fruits which were expected to come from them). But they enjoy (the fruits of) those seeds which are produced after ten months or a year. 

22 The terra in the original is prabâhuk, which appears to mean, literally, measured by the length of arms (which both are equal). Sây, cxplains it in the following way: 

प्रवाहक सतो वामदक्षिणभागौ समौ कृत्वाऽवस्थितस्य शिरो यथोबतं सन्मध्येऽवतिष्ठते. 

* That is to say, tho performance of the Vişuvan day must be distinguished from that of all other days of the Sattra. The Mabadivakîrtyam Saman, the Darohapam, &c, ought to be peculiar to it. Anas hore clearly means “the performance of the ceremonies," or more especially the "Sastras required for the Soma day." 

24 This is implied in the term (97 ) upa, meaning, “ in addition.' 

203 

[299] Therefore, the Hotar ought to repeat the (Sastra for the) Vişuvan day during the year (also). For this day's Sastra is the year. Those who observe this day's performance (during the year) obtain the (enjoyment of the) year, 

The sacrificer destroys, by means of the Vişuran day's performance, during the year, all consequences of guilt (påpman). 

By means of (the performance of the Sattra ceremonies in) the months (during which the Sattra is lasting), he removes the consequences of guilt from his limbs (the months being the limbs of the year). By means of the Vişuyan day's performance during the year he removes the conse quences of guilt from the head (the Vipuran being the head. He who has such a knowledge removes, by means of the Vişuvan day's perform ance, the consequences of guilt. 

They ought (on the Mahâvrata day) to kill for the libations an ox for Vigvakarian (Tvastar), in addition (to the regular animal, a goat, required for that occasion); it should be of two colours, on both sides. 

Indra, after having slain Vạitra, became Višvakarman. Prajapati, after having produced the creatures, became (also) Višvakarman. The year is Višvakarman.25 Thus (by sacrificing such a bullock) they reach Indra, their own Self, Prajâ pati, the year, Viúvakarman (i.e., they remain united with them, they will not die), and thus they obtain a footing in Indra, in their own Self (their prototypel, in Prajâ pati, in the year, in Višvakarman. He who has such a knowledge, obtains a firın footing.

FOURTH CHAPTER. (The Dvadasäha Sacrifice. Its Origin, and General Rules for its Performa 

ance. The Initiatory Rites.) 

23. (Origin of the Dvadasaha. Its Gayatri Form.) Prajapati felt a desire to create and to multiply himself. He under went (in order to accomplish this end) austerities. After having done so, he perceived the Dvadasâha sacrifice (ceremonies to be) in his limbs and vital airs. He took it out of his limbs and vital airs, and made it twelve fold. He seized it and sacrificed with it. Thence he (Prajâ pati) was produced (i.e., that form of his which enters creatures, his material body), Thus he was reproduced through himself in offspring and cattle. He who 

25 Višvakarman means it who does all work." Generally, the architect of the gods is meant by the term, 

204 

has such a kvowledge, is reproduced through himself in offspring and cattle. 

Having the desire to obtain, through the Gâyatrî, throughout the Dvadasâha everywhere, the enjoyment of all things, (he meditated) how (this might be achieved.) 

(It was done in the following way.) The Gâyatri was at the beginning of the Dvadasâba in (the form of) splendour, in the midst of it, in (that of the) metre, at its end in (that of) syllables. Having pene trated with the Gâyatri the Dvâdasâha everywhere, he obtained the enjoyment of everything 

He who knows the Gayatri as having wings, eyes, light, and lustre, goes by means of her, being possessed of these things, to the celestial world. 

The Dvadasaha (sacrifice) is the Gâyatri with wings, eyes, light, and lustre. The two wings (of the Drâdašâha) are the two Atirâtras which are at the beginning and end of it (lit., round about). The two Agniştomas (within the two Atirâtras) are the two [301] eyes. The eight Ukthya days (between the Atirâtra and Aguiştoma at the beginning, and the Agnistoma and Atirâ tra at the end) are the soul. . 

He who has such a knowledge, goes to heaven by means of the wings, the eyes, the light, and lustre of the Gâyatri. 

24. (On the Different Parts, and the Duration of the Dvadasäha Sacrifice, On the Brihati Nature of this Sacrifice. The Nature of the Brihati.) 

The Dvâdasâha consists of three Tryabas (a sacrificial performance lasting for three days) together with the "tenth day" and the two Atirâtras. After having undergone the Diksâ ceremony (the initiation) during twelve days, one becomes fit for performing (this) sacrifice. During twelve nights he undergoes the Upasads? (fasting). By means of them, he shakes off (all guilt) from his body. 

He who has such a knowledge, becomes purified and clean, and enters the deities, after having during (these) twelve days been born anew and shaken off (all guilt) from his body. 

The Dvadasâha consists (on the whole) of thirty-six days. The Brihati has thirty-six syllables. The Dvâdasâha is the sphere for the Brihati (in which she is moving). By means of the Brihati, the gods 

"He keeps the fasting connected with the Upasad ceremony. At this occasion he must live on milk alone. The Upasads are, at the Dradasaha, performed during four days, on each day thrice, that makes twelve. See about them 1, 25. 

205 

med} 

obtained (all) these worlds ; for by ten syllables they reached this world (the eartb), by (other) ten they reached the air, by (other) ten the sky, by 

four they reached the four directions, and by two they gained a firm footing in this world. 

[302] He who has such a knowledge, secures a firm footing (for himself). 

About this they (the theologians) ask, How is it, that this (particular metre of thirty-six syllables) is called Brihati, 2.e., the great one, there being other metres which are stronger, and exceed the (Brihati) in number of syllables? (The answer is) It is called so on account of the gods having reached by means of it (all) these worlds, by ten syllables, this world (the earth), &c. He who has such a knowledge, obtains any thing he might desire. 

25. (Prajapati Instituted the Dvadasaha. The Nature of this Sacrifice. By 

Whom it should be Performed.) The Dvadasâha is Prajâpati's sacrifice. At the beginning, Prajapati sacrificed with it. He said to the Seasons and Months, "Make me sacri fice with the Dvådaśâha (1.e., initiate me for this sacrifice)." 

After having performed on him the Dikşà ceremony, and pre vented him from leaving (when walking in the sacrificial compound) they said to him, "Now give us (first something), then we shall make the sacrifice." He granted them food, and juice (milk, &c.). Just this juice is put in the Seasons and Months. . When he granted them that, then they made him sacrifice. This is the reason that only the man who can afford to give something is fit for performing this sacrifice. 

When receiving his gifts, they (the Seasons and Months) made him (Prajâpati) sacrifice. Thence must be who receives gifts, sacrifice for another. Thus both parties succeed those who, having such a knowledge, bring sacrifices for others, as well as those who have them performed for themselves. 

[303] The Seasons and Months felt themselves burdened, as it were (with guilt), for having accepted at the Dvadasaha (which they performed for Prajapati) a reward. They said to Prajapati, "Make us (also) sacrifice with the Dvadasaha." He consented and said to them, “Become ye initiated (take the Dikşâ)!" The deities residing in the first (the 80 called bright) half of the months first underwent the Dikşâ ceremony, and thus removed the consequences of guilt. Thence they are in the 

206 

daylight as it were ; for those who have their guilt (really) removed, are in the daylight, as it were (may appear everywhere). 

The deities, residing in the second half of the months) afterwards underwent the Dikşâ. But they could) not wholly remove the evil consequences of guilt. Thence they are darkness, as it were ; for those who have their guilt not removed are darkness, as it were (comparable to it). 

Thence he who has this knowledge ought to have performed his Diksâ first and in the first half (of the month). He who has such a kaowledge, thus removes (all) guilt from himself. 

It was Prajapati who, as the year, resided in the year, the seasons, and months. The seasons and months thus resided (also) in Prajapati as the year. Thus they mutually reside in one another. He who has the Dvâdasáha performed for himself resides in the priest (who performs it for him). Thence they (the priests) say, “No sinner is fit for having the Dvadasaha sacrifice performed, nor should such an one reside in me." 

The Dvâdasâha is the sacrifice for the first-born, He who first had the Drâdasâha performed (became) the first-born among the gods. It is the sacrifice for a leader (a śreştha). He who first performed it (be came) the leader among the gods. The first-born, [304] the leader (of his family or tribe) ought to perform it (alone); then happiness lasts (all the year) in this the place where it is performed). 

(They say} "No sinner ought to have the Dvâdasâha sacrifice performed; no such one should reside in me (the priest).” 

The gods (once upon a time) did not acknowledge that Indra had the right of primogeniture and leadership. He said to Brihaspati, "Bring for me the Dvadasâ ha sacrifice.” He complied with his wish. Thereupon the gods acknowledged Indra's right of primogeniture and leadership. 

He who has such a knowledge, is acknowledged as the first-born and leader. All his relations agree as (to his right) to the leadership. 

The first three (Soma) days of the Dvâdasáhal are ascending (ie, the metres required are from the morning to the evening libation increasing in number); the middle three (Soma) days are crossed, (i. e., there is no regular order of increase nor decrease in the number of syllables of the metres); the last three (Soma) days are descending (i.e., the number of syllables of the metres from the morning to the evening libations is decreasing).* 

* Here are the nine principal days of the Dyâdasáha sacrifice mentioned. They constitute the Navaratra, i.e., sacrifice lasting for nine nights (and days). It consists of

On account of the (metres of the first three days (tryuha) being ascending, the fire blazes up, for the upward region belongs to the fire. On account of the (metres of the) middle three days being crossed, the wind blows across; the wind moves across (the other [305] regions), and the waters flow (also) across ; for the region which is across (the others) belongs to the wind. On account of (the metres of) the three last days being descending, that one (the sun) burns downwards (sending his rays down), the rain falls down, (and, the constellations (in heaven) send (their light) down. For the region which goes down belonge to the sun. 

The three worlds belong together, so do these three Tryabas. These (three) worlds jointly shine to the fortune of him who has such a knowledge.

Prajâpati. Jamadagni Sâmidheni terses required. The Purodasa for Vayu. On Some Peculiar Rite when the Ducidasáha is Performed as a Sattra.) 

The Dikşâ went away from the gods. They made it enter the two months of spring, and joined it to it; but they did not get it out (of these months for using it). They then made it subsequently enter the two hot months, the two rainy months, the two months of autumn, and the two winter months, and joined it to then. They did not get it out of the two winter months. They then joined it to the two months of the dewy season (Sisira); they (finally) got it out of these (two months for using it). 

He who has such a knowledge, reaches any one he wishes to reach, but his enemy will not reach him. 

Thence the sacrificer who wishes that the Dikşâ for a sacrificial session should come (by itself) to him, should hare the Dikrâ rites performed on himself [306] during the two months of the dewy season. Thus he takes his Dikşâ when the Dikşâ herself is present, and receives her in person. 

(The reason that he should take his Dikşâ during the two months

three Tryanas, i.e., three days' performance of the Soma sacrifice. The order of metres on the first three days is, at the morning libation, Gayatri (twenty-four syllables); at the midday libation, Triştubh (forty-four syllables); at the evening libation, Jagati (forty-eight syllables). On the middle three days the order of metres is, Jagati, Gayatri, and Triştubh, and on the last three days, Tristubh, Jagati, and Gayatri, 

The Dyadasaha is regarded as a Sattra or session. The initiation for the per formance of a Sattra is a Sattra díkså. 

of the dewy season is) because both tame and wild animals are, in these two months (for want of green fodder), very thin and show only, bones, and present in this state the most vivid image of the Dikså (thè aim of which ceremony is to make the sacrificer lean by fasting). 

Before he takes his Dikşâ, he sacrifices an animal for Prajapati. For (the immolation of) this (animal) he ought to repeat seventeen Sâmi dhenit verses. For Prajapati is seventeen-fold. (This is done) for reaching Prajâpati. Aprî verses which come from Jamadagni are (required) for (the immolation of) this animal. About this they say, Since at (all) other animal sacrifices only such Aprî verses are chosen as are traceable to the Rist ancestors (of the sacrificer), why are at this (Prajapati sacrifice) only Jamadagni verses to be used by all ? (The reason is) The Jamadagni verses have a universal character, and make successful in everything. This (Prajapati) animal is of a universal character, and makes successful in everything. The reason that they use (at that occasion) Jamadagni verses, is to secure all forms, and to be successful in every thing. 

The Purodása belonging to this animal is Vâyu's. About this they. ask, Why does the Purodása, which forms part of the animal sacrifice, belong to Vayu, whilst the animal itself belongs to another deity (Prajapati)? (To this objection) one ought to reply, Prajapati is the sacrifice; (that Purođâša is given to Vậyu), in order to have the sacrifice performed without any mistake. Though this [307] Purodasa belongs to Vâyu, it is not withheld from Prajapati. For Vậyu is Prajapati. This has been said by a Rişi in the words, pavamânah prajapatih (9,5, 9), i.e., Prajapati who blows. 

If the Dvadasâha be (performed as) a Sattra, then the sacrificers -should put all their several fires together, and sacrifice in them. All 

should take the Dîkşâ, and all should prepare the Soma juice. 

He concludes (this sacrifice) in spring. For spring is sap. By doing so, he ends (his sacrifice) with (the obtaining of) food (resulting from the sap of spring).

(The Rivalry of the Metres. The Separation of Heaven and Earth. They 

Contract a Marriage. The Sâma Forms in which they are Wedded to one another. On the Black Spot in the Moon. On Poşa and Uşa.) , 

Each of the metres (Gâyatri, Tristubh, and Jagatî) tried to occupy 

See 1, 1. *At Sattra or sacrificial session all the sixteen priests in their turn become sacrificers. They perform the ceremonies for one another, 

200 

the place of another actre. Gayatri aspired after the place of Triştubh and Jagatî, Triştubh after that of Gayatri and Jagati, and Jagati after that of Gayatri and Trişțubh. 

Thereupon Prajapati saw this Dvadasâha with metres being remove;l from their proper places (vyúlhachhandasa). He took it and sacrificel with it. In this way, he made the metres obtain (fulfilment of) all their desires. He who has such a knowledge, obtains (fulfilment of) all desires. 

The Hotar removes the metres from their proper places, in order that the sacrifice should not lose its essence. 

This circumstance that the Hotar changes the proper place of the metres has its analogy in the fact (308) that (great) people when travelling (to a distant place) yoke to their carriages, at every stage, fresh horses or oxen which are not fatigued. Just in the same way, the sacrificers travel to the celestial world by employing at every stage fresh metres (repre senting the horses or oxen) which are not fatigued. (This results) from changing the places of the metres. 

These two worlds (heaven and earth) were (once) joined. (Subse quently, they separated. (After their separation) there fell neither rain, nor was there sunshine. The five classes of beings (gods, men, &c ) then did not keep peace with one another. (Thereupon) the goils brought about a reconciliation of both these worlds. Both contracted with one another a marriage, according to the rites observed by the gods. 

In the form of the Rathantara Siman, this earth is wedded to heaven; and in the form of the Bțihat Saman, heaven is wedded to the earth. (And again) in the form of the Naudbasa Sâman, the earth is wedded to heaven; and in the form of the Syaita Saman, heaven is weddeci to tho earth. 

In the form of smoke, this earth is wedded to heaven; in the form of rain, heaven is wedded to the earth. 

The earth put a place fit for offering sacrifices to the gods into heaven. Heaven (then) put cattle on the earth. 

The place fit for offering sacrifices to the gods which the earth put in heaven is that black spot in the moon. 

This is the reason that they perform their sacrifice in those hall months in which the moon is waxing and full (for only then that black spot is visible); for they only wish to obtain that (black spot). to Heaven (put) on the earth herbs for pastorage. About them Tura, the son of Kavaşa, said:0 Janamejaya, what is to be understood by the worils) (309) poşet (fodder) and uş (herbs of pasturage)? This is the reason that those who care for what proceeds from the cow (sub as milk, &c.) 

balti. 

put the question (when sending a cow to a pasturage), are there ûşas, i.l., herbs of pasturage ? For uşa is fodder, 

That world turned towards this world, surrounding it. Thence heaven and earth were produced. Neither came heaven from the air, nor the earth from the air. 

28. 

(On the Sama Prışthas.) At the beginning, there were Brihat and Rathantaram ; through them there were Speech and Mind. Rathantaram is Speech, Brihat is Mind. Bribat being first created, thought Rathantaram to be inferior; the Rathantaram put an embryo in its body and brought forth Vairûpain. These two, Rathantaram and Vairûpam joined, thought Brihat to be in ferior to them; Brihat put an embryo in its own body, whence the Vairâjam was produced. These two, Bribat and Vairâjam joined, thought Rathantaram and Vairûpam to be inferior to them. Rathantaram then put an embryo in its body, whence the Sâkvaram was produced. These thee, Rathaptaram, Vairûpam, and Sâkvaram thought Bribat and Vaira jam to be inferior to them. Brihat then put an embryo in its body, whence the Raivatam was produced. These three Samans on each side (Rathantaram, Vairûpam, Sâkvaram, and Brihat, Vairâjam, Raivatam) became the six Prişthas." 

At this (time, when the Sâma Pristhas originated) the three metres (Gayatri, Triştubh, and Jagati) (310) were unable to get hold of these six Pristhas. Gayatri put an embryo in herself and produced Anustubh, Triştubh put an embryo in hereself and produced Pankti. Jagati put an embryo in herself and produced the Atichhandas (metres). The three metres having thus become six, were thus able to hold the six Přişthas. 

The sacrifice of him becomes (well) performed and (also) becomes well performed for the whole assemblage (of sacrificer), who at this occa sion takes his Dikşâ when knowing this production of the metres and Přişthas.

FIFTH CHAPTER. (The Two First Days of the Dvádasáha Sacrifice) 

29. (The Sastras of the Morning and Midday Libations on the First Day.) 

· Agni is the leading deity of the first day. The Stoma (required) is . .See page 214. 

? The purport of this paragraph is to show why on certain days of the Dyadasaha the Rathantara Sâman, and on others the Brihat Sâman, is required for forming a Pristha with another Sâman. See on these different Şâmans 4, 13. 

Trivrit (the nine-fold), the Saman Rathantaram, the wotre Gayatri. Tie who knows what deity, what Stoma, what Saman, what metre (aro re quired on the first day), becomes successful by it. The words i, and pro are the characteristics of the first day. (Further) characteristics of this day are : yukta joined, ratha carriage, dśu swift, på to drink, the mentioning of the deities in the first padas (of the verses repeated) by their very names, the allusion to this world (earth), Såmans akin to Ra thantaram, metres akin to Gayatri, the future of kri to make. 

The Ajya hymn of the first day is, upa prayanto adhraram (1,74); for it contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

[811] The Pra-uga Sastram is, vayavâyâhi daréateme (1,2-3); for it contains the term d, a characteristic of the first day. 

The Pratipad (beginning) of the larutvatiya Sastra is, a två ratham yathotaye (8, 57, 1-3); its Aluchara (sequel), idar vaso suitam andhal (8, 2, 1-3); they contain the terins ratha and piba (drink), which are characteristics of the first day. 

The Indra-Nibava Pragâtha is, indra nediya ed ihi (Välakis, 5, 5-6); here the deity is mentioned in the first pada, which is a characteristic of the first day, 

The Brahmaṇaspatya Pragatha is, praitu Brahmanaspatih (1, 10, 3-4); it contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The Dbâyyâs are, agnir netà, toam Soma kratubhik, pintanty apak (Ait. Br. 3, 18); here are the deities mentioned in the first padas, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The Marutvatiya Pragatha is, prava indraya brihate (8, 78, 3-4); it contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The (Nivid) hymn is, â yatv indro vase (4, 21); it contains the term it, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

(Nişkeralya Sastra) The Rathantara Pșiştham is, abhi två súra 12onumo (7, 32, 22-23) and abhi två púrvapitaye (8, 3, 7-8); (this is done) at a Rathantara day, of which characteristic the first day is. 

The Dhâyyâ is, yad vãvâna (Ait. Br. 3, 22); it contains the term a, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The Sârga Pragâtha is, piba sulasya (8, 3, 1-2); it contains the torm piba, “ drink,” which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The Târkşyam is, tyam at şu rájinam (Ait. Br. 4, 20). The flotar repcats it before the (Nivid) hgmn (812) (of the Nişkevalya Sastra). The Târkşyam is safe journey. (It is repeated) for securing safety, 

He 

be a characteristicha is, pita sulasyctic of the first 90%. The flotarIle who has such a knowledge makes his journey in safety and reaches the end of the year in safety. 

30. (The Rest of the Nişkevalya Sastra, and the Sastras of the Dvening 

Libation) The (Nivid) hymn (of the Nişkevalya Sastra) is, a na indro dúrúd (4, 20); it contains the term â, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

Both Nivid hymns, that of the Marutvatîya as well as that of the Nişkevalya Sastras are (so called) Sampdtas. ' Vamadeva, after having seen (once) these (three) worlds, got possession of them (samopatat) by means of the Sampátas. On account of his getting possession of (sampati) by means of the Sampâ tas, they are called by this name (sampâtas). 

The reason that the Hotar, on the first day, repeats two Sampata hymns, is, to reach the celestial world, to get possession of it, and join (its inhabitants). 

The Pratipad (beginning verse) of the Vaišvadeva Sastra on the first day, which is a Rathantara day? [318] is, tat savitur vrinimahe, (5, 82, 1-3); its Anuchara (sequel) is, adya no deva savitar (5, 82, 4-6). It is used at a Rathantara day, which is characteristic of the first day, 

The (Nivid) hymn for Savitar is, yusījate mana uta (5, 81); it con tains the term yuj to join, which is a characteristic of the first day, 

The (Nivid) hymn for Heaven and Earth is, pra dydvd yajñâih (1. 159); it contains the pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The (Nivid) hymn for the Ribhus is, iheha vo manasá (3, 60). If it would contain pra, and Q, the (proper) characteristics of the first day, then all would be pra, i, e., going forth, and consequently the sacrificers would depart (präisyan) from this world. This is the reason that the Hotar repeats on the first day (as Nivid hymn for Heaven and Earth) iheha mono though it does not contain the term characteristic of the first day). 

1 See Ait. Brâhm. 6, 18. 

2 The so-called Rathantara days of the Dvadasaha are the first, third and fifth. Sày, here remarks that the Pratipad of the Vaišvadera Sastras is joined to the Rathantara Sa man. This is, however, an erroneous statement, as I can prove from the Sama prayoga of the Dvadasaha (the last sacrifice of this kind has been, in this part of India, performed about fifty years ago) which is in my possession. The triplet addressed to Savitar is always (at all Soma sacrifices) the opening of the Vaišvadeva Sastra on the evening libation ; but on the first day of the Dvadasâha, there is besides the Arbhava Pavamâna Stotra, only the Yajña yajõiya Sâma used, the same which is required at the evening libation of the Agnistoma. Sây. wrote that explanation only to explain the term råthantara. This means only that this is done on the « Rathantara day." The Rathantara is on this day required at the midday libation. 

213 

Tha, i.e., here, is this world. By doing so, the Ilotar makes the sacrificers enjoy this world. 

The (Nivid) hymn for the Visvedevâh is, devån hure briħach chha vasah svastaye (10, 66). The deities are mentioned in the first pada, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The reason that the Hotar repeats this hymn (as Nivid Sûkta) for the Vigvedevâh on the first day, is to make the journey (of the sacrificers) safe, because those who hold a session lasting for a year, or who perform the Dvadasaha, are going to set out on a long journey. Thus the Hotar makes (for them) the journey safe. 

He who has such a knowledge reaches in safety the end of the year, as well as those who have a Hotar knowing this and acting accordingly, 

The Partipad of the Agnimâruta Sastra is, vais vânardya prithu pâjase (3, 3). The deity (Vaišvânara) [314] is mentioned in the first pada, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas is, pra tvakşasaḥ pra tavasah (1, 87). It contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

He repeats the Jâtavedâs verse, jâta vedase sunavâma (1, 90, 1) before (the Jâtavedâs) hymn. The Jâtavedâs verse is safe journey. (It is repeated) for securing a safe journey. Thus he secures a safe journey (for the sacrificer). He who has such a knowledge reaches in safety the end of the year. 

The (Nivid) hymn for Jâtavedâs is, pra tavyasím navyasim (1,143). It contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the first day. 

The Agnimâruta Sastra (of the first day of the Dvadasâha) is the same as in the Agniştoma? The creatures live on what is performed equally in the sacrifice (i.e., in several different kinds of sacrifices). Thence the Agnimâruta Sasta (of the first day of the Dvadasaha) is identical (with that of the Agniştoma). 

31 (The Characteristics of the Second Day of the Drádasáha. The Sastras of the Morning and Midday Libations. Story of Saryata, the son of Manu) 

Indra is the leading deity of the second day; the Stoma (required) is the fifteen-fold (pañchadaśa), the Sâman is Brihat, the metre is Tris țubh. He who knows what deity, what Stoma, what Sâman, what metre (are required for the second day) succeeds by it. On the second day, neither a nor pra (the characteristics of the first day) are used, but sthân (derivations from this root)" to stand," is the characteristic. Other 

* See 3, 35-38. 

characteristics of the second day are, urdhva (315) upwards, prati to wards, antar in, between, vrişan male, vridhan growing, the deities men tioned (by their names) in the second pada, the allusion to the airy region, what has the nature of the Brihat Sâman, what has the nature of the Trişçubh the present tense". 

The Ajya (hymn) of the second day is, agnim dritam vrinimale (1, 12); this contains the present tense (in vrinimahe), which is a charac teristic of the second day. 

The pra-uga Sastra is, vâyo ye te sahasrino (2, 41); it contains the terın vridhan growing, increasing, in the words sutah soma zità ridha (2, 41, 4), which is a characteristic of the second day. 

The Pratipad (beginning) of the Marutvatîya Sastra is, viścânarasya vaspatêm (8, 57, 4-6), and its Anuchara (sequel), indra it Somapt (8, 2, 4-6). They contain the terms vridhan (8, 57, 5) and antar (8, 2, 5), which are characteristics of the second day. 

The constant (Indra-Nihava) Pragatha is, indra nediya edihi. 

The Brahmaṇaspati Pragâ tha is, uttiştha brahmanaspate, it contains the term úrdhva up, upwards, (in the word uttiştha, i.e., rise), which is a characteristic of the second day. 

The constant Dhâyyâs are, agnir netd tvam soma kratubhih, pinvanty apah. 

The Marutvatîya Pargâtħa is, brihad indraya gâyata (8, 87, 1-2); it contains the term vridhan increasing, in the word ritarridhá. 

The (Nivid) hymn (of the Marutvatîya Sastra) is, indra somam soma pate (3, 32); it contains the (316) term vrişan in the word â vrişasva "gather strength" (show yourself as a male 3, 32, 2), which is a charac teristic of the second day. 

The Brihat Priştham (i. e., Stotriyam, and Anurûpam) is tvam iddhi havâmahe (6, 46, 1-2) and toam hyehi cherave (8, 50, 7-8); (this is done) on the Bârhata day, of which kind the second day is (the use of the Bțihat priştha), being a characteristic of the second day. 

The constant Dhâyyâ (of the Niskevalya Sastra) is, yad vävdna. 

The Sâma Pragatha is, ubhayan śrinavachcha (8, 50, 1-2); (the term ubhayam, i. e. both) means, what is today and what was yesterday. It belongs to the Brihat Sâman, which is a charateristic of the second day. 

The constant Târkşya is, tyam u şú våjinam. 

The word for " present tense" in the original is kurvat, which is the participle of the present tense of the root leri to wake. That it cannot have any other meaning, undoubtedly follows from the application of this term to the hymn aguim dutam vrin, muhe, in the wbole of which there is nowhere any present tense or present participle of tho root kri, but present tenses of otlor verbs. 

* Tho Barh a ta days are the second, fourth, and sixth.

(The Remainder of the Nişkeralya Sastra and the Sastras of the Erening 

Libation on the Second Day) 

The (Nivid) hymn of the Niskevalya Sastra) is, ya ta ttiz arami (6, 25); it contains the term vrişan, in tbe word vrisnyú ni 16, 25, 3), which term is a characteristic of the second day. 

The Pratipad of the Vaišvadeva Sastra is, viśvo derasya netus (5, 50, 1), and tat savitur varenyam (3, 62, 10-11), the Anuchara (sequel) is, o viśvadevam satpatim (5, 82, 7-9). It belongs to the Brihat day, and is thus a characteristic of the second day (which is a Bțihat day). 

The (Nivid) hymn for Savitar is, ud u Sya derah sarita (6, 71); it contains the trem “ up upwards” (in ut), which is a characteristic of the second day. [317] The Nivid hymn for Dyâvâprithivi is, te hi dyarâprithici (1, 160); it contains the term antar, which is a characteristic of the second day. 

The Nivid) hymn for the Ribhus is, takşan ratham (1, 111), it con tains the term vrişan, in the word orişanvast, which is a characteristic of the second day. 

The (Nivid) hymn for the Visvedevâh is, yajñasya yo rathyam (10, 92); it contains the term oraşã in the words trışa ketur, which is a characteristic of the second day. This hymn is by Sâryâta. As the Ad giras were engaged in a sacrificial session for going to heaven, they be came always confounded in their recitations) as often as they were going to perform the ceremonies of the second day of the Şalaha). Sáryâta, the son of Manu, made them repeat the hymn, yajñasya rathyam on the second day, whereupon they got aware of the sacrifice (the sacrificial personage), and (by means of it) of the celestial world. The reason that the Hotar repeats this hymn on the second day is (to help the sacrificer), to get aware of the sacrifice, and consequently to see the celestial world (of which he wishes to became an inhabitant). 

The Pratipad (beginning) of the Agnimâruta Sastra is, prikşasya vrişno (6,8); it contains the term vrişan, which is a characteristic of the second day, 

The (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas in the Agnimiruta Sastra is, vrisne sardhâya (1, 64); it contains the term vrisan, which is a charac teristic of the second day. 

The constant Jatavedâs verse is, Jatavedase sunacôma. 

The (Nivid) bymn for Jatavedaš is yajñena vardhata (2, 2); it con tains the term vridh, which is a charcteristic of the second day.

FIRST CHAPTER (The Characteristics and Sastras of the Third and Fourth 

Days of the Dvadasáha) 

(The Characteristics of the Third-Day. The Sastras of the Morning 

and Midday Libations) The leading deities of the third day are the Visvedevah; its (leading) Stoma is the so-called Saptadasa (seventeen-fold), its Sâman the Vairûpam, its metre the Jagati. He who knows what deity, what Stoma, what Saman, what metre (are required on the third day), becomes successful by it. 

What hymn has a refrain, that is a characteristic of the third day, Other characteristics are: ašva horse, anta end, repetition, (punarduritti) consonance (in the ending vowels), cohabitation, the term "covered, close (paryasta), the term three, what has the form of anta (end), the mentioning of the deity in the last pada, an allusion to that world, the Vairûpam Sâman, the Jagatî metre, the past tense. 

The Ajya Sastra is, yukşvå hi devahůtamán (8,64). The gods went to heaven by means of the third day. The Asuras (and) Raksas prevented them (from entering it). They said (to the Asuras), “Become deformed, become deformed ” (virûpa); when the Asuras were becoming deformed, the Devas entered (heaven). This produced the Samnan called Vairūpam, thence it is called so (from virúpu deformed). He who has become deformed in consequence of his own guilt, destroys it (his deformity) by means of this knowledge. 

(819) The Asuras persecuted the Devas again, and came into contact with them. The Devas turned horses (ašva) and kicked them with their feet. Thence the horses are called aśva (from as to reach). He who krows this obtains (ainute) all he desires. Thence the horse is the swiftest of animals, because of its kicking with the hind legs. He” who has such a knowledge destroys the consequences of guilt. This is the reason that the Ajya hymn on the third day contains the term esva horse, which is a characteristic of the third day. 

dia 

The Pra-uga Sastra consists of the following triplets : viyaviylihi vitaye (5, 51, 5-7) vayo yahi sivid (8, 26, 23-25), indras cha củyoo esim sutanam (5, 51, 6-8), & mitre varuine vayam (5, 72, 1-3), ašvindveha gachhatám (5, 75, 7-9), dyâhy adribhih (5, 40, 1-3), sajûr deveblir visuebhir (7, 34, 15-17), uta nah priya (6,61 10-12). They are in the Uşnih metre, bave a refrain (samânodarkam), which is a characteristic of the third day. $ 

Tam tam id rådhase (8, 57, 7-9), traya indrasya Soma (8, 2, 7-9) are the beginning and the sequel of the Marutvatiya Sastra, which contain the terms, nytå, i.e., consonance (8, 57, 7) and traya, i e, three, which are characteristics of the third day. Indra nediya (Vál. 5, 5-6) is the constant (Indra-Nihava) pragathah." Prantnam Brahmaraspatir (1, 40,5-6) is the Brahmanaspatya Pragatha which has a consonance (of vowels), is a charac teristic of the third day. Agnir netâ (3, 20, 4), toar Soma kratubhik (1,91, 2), and pinvanty apô (1, 64, 6) are the immovable Dháyyas. Nakih Sudásô rathan (7, 32, 10) (820) is the Marutvatiga Pragatha, which contains the term prayasta, i.e., covered, closed. Tryaryama manuşo devatâtå (5, 29) is the (Nivid) hymn (for the Marutvatiya Shastra) ; it contains the term “ three." Yad dydra indra (8, 59, 5-6), yad indre ydratas (7, 32, 18-19) form the Vairûpam Pristham on the third day, which is a Rathantara day, which is a characteristic of the third day. 

Yad väváno (10, 74,6) is the constant Dhûyyi. By repeating (after this Dhayya) : abhi tuâ sira nonumah (7, 32, 22-23) the Hotar turns back the womb of this day), because this (third) day is, as to its position, a Rathantara day which Sâman is, therefore, the womb of it. Indra tridhätu saranam (6, 46, 9-10) is the Sama Pragatha ; it contains the term "three" (in tridhata). Tyam û şut vajinan (10, 178) is the constant Tarksya.

of the Evening Libation of the Third Day) Yo jatô eva pratham manasud n (2, 12) is the (Nivid) hymn, overy verse of which ends in the same words (sa jardsa Indrah), which is a characteristic of the third day. It contains the words sa jana and Indra. If this be recited, then Indra becomes possessd of his Indra (peculiar) power. The Sâma singers, therefore, say, the Rigvedis (the Hotars) praise Indra's peculiar nature (power, indrasya indriyam). This hymn is by the Rişi Gritsamada. By means of it, this Rişi obtained Indra's favour 1 Bayaga explains-panarnirritam as follows: gan auregui, 99: 44 RECTI, This clearly expresses what we call consonance ; tha recurronce of the same vowel as the end is compared to the movements of a dancer (ninrittam),

and conquered the highest world. He who has this knowledge obtains Indra's favour and conquers the highest world. 

Tat Savitur vrinimahe vayan (5, 82, 1-3) and adyâ nô deva savitah (5, 82, 3-5), are the beginning and the (321) sequel of the Vaišvadeva Sastra on the third day, which is a Rathantara day. 

Tad devasya Savitur vâryam mahad urinimahe (4, 53, 1) is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar. Because the end (which is aimed at) is a great one (mahad); and the third day is also an end. Ghritena dyavá prithivi (6, 70) is the (Nivid) hymn for Dyâvâprithivi. It contains the words ghritasriyâ, ghsita pricha, ghritavridhâ, in which there is a repetition (because the word ghrita is three times repeated) and the consonance of the terminating vowels (because there is three times à at the end), which are characteristics of the third day. 

Anaśvô jâtô anabhišur (4, 36) is the (Nivid) bymn for the Ribhus. It contains, in the words rathas trichakrah, the term 'three" (tri), which is a characteristic of the third day. 

Parávato ye didhişanta (10, 63) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Vidvedevâh. Because the word anta (the end) is to be found in the word paravató (atô in the strong form antó), and the third day is an end (an object). This is the Gayasûkta, by which Gaya, the son of Plata, obtained the favour of the Visvedevah and conquered the highest world. He who has this knowledge obtains the favour of the Visvedevah and conquers the bigbest world. 

Vaisvanaraya dhisanám (3, 2) is the beginning of the Agnimâruta Sastra. The anta (end) is in dişand (but the t is wanting). The third day is also an "end"(to a Tryaha or period of three days). . 

Dhårádard maruto (2, 34) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas. Here by anta is the plural (most of the nominatives of this verse are in the plural) to be understood, because the plural is the end (the last among the terminations, following the singular and dual). The third day is also the end of the Tryaha). [822) Jatavedase sunavama (1, 99, 1) is the constant verse for Jatavedâs. Toam agne prathamo angird (1, 31) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jâtavedås, where each verse begins by the same words (tvam agne), which is a characteristic of the third day. By repeating tvam tvam in every verse), the Hotar alludes to the following three days (from the fourth to the sixth) for connecting (both series of three days). Those who, with such a know ledge, repeat (at the end of the last Sastra of the third day a hymn every verse of which contains the term tvam) have both series of three days performed without interruption and breach. 

1 

(On the Vyaikha)* (Sây. These periods of three days form part of the Navaritra-uine nights included in the Dvadasaha. [828] The first Tryahah or period o€ three days is now explained, and the very same is the first part of the pristhyam, comprising six days. Now the middle part of the Navaratra (the second three days) are to be explained. 

The Stomas and Ohhandas are at an end (i.e., all the Stoma conubi nations, and the metres are exhausted) on the third day ; that one only remains. This "that one" is the syllable vich, which consists of three sounds; vâch is one syllable, Cand (this) syllable consists of three sounds, which represent the latter thre days (out of the six), of whicb Vach (Speech) is one, and Gâus (Cow) is one, and Dyaas (Heaven) is one. Therefore, Vâch alone is the leading deity of the fourth day. 

On just the fourth day, they make Nyåskha of this syllable by pronouncing it with a tremulous voice, increasing and decreasing (divid ing) the tone. It serves for rising the fourth day (to make it particularly important). Because the Nyûñkha is (produces) food, for the singers seeking a livelihood wander about, in order to make food grow (by their singing for rain). 

By making Nyüõkba on the fourth day, they produce food; (because it is done) for producing food. Thence the fourth day is jätabat, Liens productive. Some say, one must make Nyûíkha with a word comprising four sounds; for the animals are fourfooted, in order to obtain cattle. Others say, one must make Nyünkha with three sounds. These three sounds are the three worlds. In order to conquer these worlds, they say, 

* The rules for making the Nyd õkba are laid dwon in Asyal. Sr. S (7,11), They are प्रातरनुवाक प्रतिपद्यर्चा योयूखो द्वितीयस्वरमांकारं त्रिमात्रमुदात्तं त्रिस्तस्य तस्य चोपरिष्टादपरिमितान्पं 

Tra 

*, TIL LEHER CAR, , on the fourth day is the second sound (syllable) of each of the two first half verses in the beginning of tho Prâtaranuvâke to be pronounced with Nylökha. (This Nydükha is made in the followiog manner). The ô (in ápô revatir and râyo) is pronounced thrice with three moras, in the high tone (udatta); this (ô thus pronounced in the high tone with three moras is each time followed by an indeönite number of balf os (i.e, the vowel o pronouncod vory abruptly with half a mora only) or by five only, the last 6 (with three moras) being, however, followed by three half os only ; the first sound is pronounced with some impetus, when a syllable is spoken with Nyužkha. 

This description which is quite exact, as I can assure the reader from my having heard the Nyûñka pronounced by a Srotriya, is iHastrated in Afv by several instances. It occurs twice in the first verse of the Prâtaranuvâka (after the words yoj na rayas, the last syllable of both being changed into 6), and once in the Ajva Sukta (lignim na 10 21), after the å of the word yajiliya, and in the Nişkevalya Sastra. The Nygökha is always followed by a pratigara, pronounced by the Adhyarya, containing also the Nyúökha. 

220 

one must make Nyûñkha with one sound only. Sangalayana, the son of Mudgala, a Brahman, said " The word ' Vâch 'comprises one syllable only; therefore he who makes Nyûñkha by one sound only, does it in the right way." They say, one must make Nyûõkha with two sounds for (324] obtaining a stand-point, for man has two legs, and the animals have four; thus he places the two-footed man among the four-footed animals. Therefore, the Hotar ought to make Nyûñkha with two sounds. At the beginning, he makes Nyúñkha in the morning prayer (Prâtaranuvâka); because creatures first eat food with the mouth. In this way, the Hotar places the sacrificer with his mouth (ready for eating) towards food. 

In the Ajya Sastra, the Nyúñkha is made in the middle ; for, in the middle, he makes the creatures fond of food, and he places thus the sacrificer in the midst of food. In the midday libation, the Hotar makes Nyûñkha at the beginning, because animals eat food with their mouth. Thus he places the sacrificer with his mouth towards food. Thus he makes Ngâñkha at both the libations (morning and midday) for obtaining food. 

(The Characteristics of the Fourth Day. The Sastras of 

the Morning and Midday Libations) The leading deity of the fourth day is the Vach. The Stoma is the twenty-one-fold, the Sâman is Vairaja, the metre is Anuştubh. He who knows what deity, what Stoma, what Sâman, what metre (are required) on the fourth day, succeeds through it (the fourth day). The terms & pra are the characteristics of the fourth day. The fourth day has all the characteristics of the first, viz., yukta ratha âśu på (to drink); the mentioning of the deity in first pada, an allusion to this world. Other characteristics of the fourth day are the játa, hava, sukra what has the form of speech (the Nyûñkha), what is by Vimada viriphita, what has different metres (vichhandas), what is wanting in syllables,and [325] what has an excess of them ; what refers to Viraj and to Anuştubh ; the tense in future (karişyat). 

Agnim na svavriktibhih (10, 21) is the Ajya hymn of the fourth day, 

It is by the Risi Vimada, whose name is contained in an alliteration in it (in vivo made), and has alliterations, consonances, and assonances (viriphitam). Such a hymn is a characteristic of the fourth day. It con-- 

3 The word viriphitam has, it appears, been misunderstood by gâyaga, who explains it by “ nyúikhita," i. e,, in which the Nyankha'is made. It is true, the Nyaikha is made by the Hotar, when repeating the two Vimada hymns (agnim na svavriktibhir 10, 21, and kuha śruta indroh 10, 22) on the morning and midday (of the fourth day (See Asy. 

221 

sists of eight verses, and is in the Pankti metre ; because the sacrifice is a Pankti (series of ceremonies); and cattle are of the Paokti nature (i, e., they consist of five parts);(it is done) for obtaining cattle. 

These eight verses make ten Jagatis, * because (326) this morning libation of the middle three days (from the fourth to the sixth) belongs to the Jagat (i, e., Jagatí). This (the connection of the Jagati with the morning libation) is a characteristic of the fourth day. 

These eight verses comprise ten Apustubhs; for this is the Anuß gubh day, in the application of which metre one of the characteristics of the fourth day consists. 

These eight verses contain twenty Gâyatris; for this day is, again, a day of commencement (like the first, where Gâyatri is the metre). In this consists a characteristic of the fourth day. 

Although this hymn is neither accompanied by the chants of the Sama singers, nor by the recitations of the Hotri priests, the sacrifice does not lose its essence by it, but the sacrificial personage is even actually present in it); thence it serves as the Ajya Sastra of the fourth day. They thus develop (stretch) out (of the form of) the sacrifice (contained in this hymn), the sacrifice (i. e., this hymn is the external shape, in the boundary of which the sacrifice-conceived as a being extends and thrives), and obtain (through the medium of this hymn) the Vâch again. (This is done) for establihshing a connection (between the several periods of three days. Those who have such a knowledge move continually within the closely connected and uninterrupted periods of three days (required for having success in the sacrifice). 

Sr. S. 7, 11). Bat the term nyúňkha being perfectly known to the author of our Brahmanam, and its application even being accurately described by him (in 5, 3), it is surprising only why he should call this peculiar way of lengthening the syllable ô (m) in the midst of a verse, here viriphita, Besides, the Nyünkha does not take place in the Vimada hymn only, but in the beginning verses, the Prâtaranavâka of which verse is by the sadra Rişi Kavaşa Ailûşa. Viriphita must refer to some peculiarities which lie in the two hymns alladed to. On reference to them, every one will observe that in the first of them, each verse concludes with the word vivakşase, and contains the words vi vo made, which are an allusion to the name of the Risi Vimada, who is therefore also called zririphita ; in the second, there occurs in the two first verses in the same place in the commencement of the second pada) the term adya, and at the end of several padas in the following verses, the word vajrivaḥ. These repetitions of the same words, generally commencing with va, vi, vo is, no doubt, the proper meaning of the term “ viriphitam," as understood by the author of our Brahmanam. 

4. This is brought about by repeating thrice the first and last verses. The pankti con sists of 41 syllables. In this way of computation, one obtains 480 syllables, just as many as 10 Jagatîs comprise (Bay.) If they are divided by 32 (the number of syllables for the Apuştubh metre), then we obtain 15 Agustubhs, and if divided by 24, 20 Gayatris.مست بسته به 

The Pra-uga Sastra, which is in the Anuştubh metre, is composed of the following verses : Vâyô śukro (4, 47, 1), vihi hotrà avità (4, 48, 1). vâyô śatan harinâm (4, 48,5), indras cha vâyav eşám (4, 48 2-1), a chikitâna sukrutų (5, 66, 1-3), â no visvabhir útibhiḥ (7, 24, 4-6), tyam u vo aprah. anam (6, 44, 4-6), apa tyam vrijinam ripum (6,51, 13-15) ambitamo naditame (2, 41, 1-3), In them, there occur the words, [327] à pra, and śukra, which are characteristics of the fourth day. 

Tam två yajñebhir imahe (8, 57. 10) is the beginning (pratipad) of the Marutvatîya Sastra. The word imahe “ we ask for " in this verse, means that this day's work is to be made long (in consequence of the multitude of rites) as it were (just as one has to wait long before a request is acceded to). This is a characteristic of the fourth day (for it indicates the multitude of its rites). 

The verses, Idam vaso sutam andhah (8, 2, 1-2), Indra nediya (Val 5.5-6), prditu Brahmanaspatir (1,4, 34), Agnir netá (3, 20, 4), tvan Soma kratubhiḥ (1, 91, 2), pinvanty apô (1, 64, 6), pra va indraya brihate (8, 78, 3), which form part of the Marutvatiya Sastra of the first day, are also re quired for the fourth day, and are a characteristic of it. Śrudhi havam ma pişanya (2, 11, 1) is the hymn which contains the word hava (call), being a characteristic of the fourth day. In the hyma Marutvam Indra vris aðhô (3, 47), there is, in its last quarter (47,5), in the word huvema, the root hu perceptible, which is a characteristic of the fourth day. This hymn is in the Triştubh metre. 

By means of the padas of this hymn which stand firm, the Hotar keeps the libation lest it fall from its proper place (it should be kept in its proper place, like a piece in machinery). Imam nu mâyinam huva (8, 65, 13) is the setting (paryasa), containing the word huva, which is a characteristic of the fourth day. The verses (of this hymn) are in the Gayatri metre, for the Gayatri verses are the leaders of the midday libation in these latter three days. That metre is the leading one in which the Nivid is placed ; therefore one puts in (these) Gâyatri verses the Nivid. 

Piba Somam Indra mandatu (7, 22, 1-2) and śrudhi havam vipipa nasyâdrer (7, 22, 4-5) is the Vairâja Pristham of the Brihat days, to which the fourth day belongs. [828] This (reference to the Brihat) is a characteristic of the fourth day. 

Yad vdvâna (10, 74, 6) is the immovable Dhâyyâ. 

Tvậm iddhi havámahe (6, 46, 1) forms the womb (central verse) to which the Hotar brings (all) back, after the Dbâyyâ has been recited ; 

for this is a Bțihat Sâma day, according to its position (thence the * Pragåtha, constituting the text of the Biihat Saman, is its womb), 

223 

Tuan Indra pratitrtişu 18, 88, 5) is the Sama Pragatha ; (the third pada) asastihâ janitâ contains the term " jäta,” which is a characteristic of the fourth day. Tyam su rajinam (10, 178) is the immovable Tärkşya. 

(The Remainder of the Nişkeralya Sastry, and the 

Sastras of the Evening Libation) Kuha śruta indraḥ (10, 22) is the Vimada hymn, with alliterations, assonances, and consonances, by the Rişi whose (name, is contained in an alliteration (vi vo made in 10, 21 being taken as equal to rimada), This is one of the characteristics of the fourth day. The hymn yudhmasia te vrişabhasya (3, 46) contains (in the fourth verse) the word januşa (from the root jan " to be born"), which is a characteristic of the fourth day. It is in the Triştubh metre. By means of the padas of this hymn which stand firm, the Hotar keeps the libation, lest it fall from its proper place. 

Tyam uvah satrásaham (8,81) is the setting. Its words, visvasu girşu âyatam, indicate that this day's work is to be made long, as it were, which is one of the characteristics of the fourth day. They are in the Gayatri metre ; the Gâyatris are the leaders of the midday libation in these three 

(latter) days. [829] The Nivid is to be put in that metre which leads (the day); therefore they put the Nivid in the Gayatris. Diścô devasya netus (5, 50, 1), tat savitur varenyam (3, 62, 10-18), a visvadevam saptatim (5, 82, 7-9), are the beginning and sequel of the Vaišvadeva Sastra on the furth day, which is a Brihat day, being one of the characteristics of the fourth day. A devô yatu (7, 45) is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar; it contains the term a, which is a characteristic of the fourth day. . 

Pra dydvd yajñåih prithiot (7, 53) is the (Nivid) hymn for Dyávê prithivi; it contains the term pra, which is a characteristic of the fourth day. Pra ribhubhyô dutam iva vâcham işya (4, 33) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Ribhus; it contains the words pra and vacham isya, which are characteristics of the fourth day. Pra śukraitu devimanîşa (7, 34) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Visvedevâb ; it contains the terms pra and śukra, which are characteristics of the fourth day. It has different metres, such as consist of two padas, and such as consist of four padas. This is a characteristic of the fourth day. 

Vaisvânarasya sumatâu syama (1, 98) is the beginning of the Agni mâruta Sastra; it contains the term jäta, which is a characteristic of the fourth day. Ka in vyakta (7,56) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas. 

(In the third pada of its first verse) there are the words, nakir hy eşám janiinşi veda, which contain the root jan to be born (in jantnşi), which is a characteristic of the fourth day. The verses of this bymn are in unequal metres; some have two padas, some four. This constitutes a characteristic of the fourth day. 

Jatavedase sunaváma somam (1, 99, 1) is the immovable Jâtavedås verse. Agnim narô didhitibir (7, 1) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jâtavedâs ; it contains the term janayanta, which is a characteristic of the fourth [880] day. Its meters are unequal; there are in it Virajas and Tris tubhs. This constitutes a characteristic of the fourth day.

SECOND CHAPTER. (The Characteristics and Sastras of the Fifth and Sixth Days of the Dvádasdha) 

6 The Characteristics of the Fifth day. The Sastras 

of the Morning and Midday Libations) The leading deity of the fifth day is Gdus (the cow). Its Stoma is the Triņata (twenty-seven-fold), the Saman is the Sakvaram, the metre is Pañkti. He who knows what deity, what Stoma, what Sâman, what metre (are required on this day), succeeds by it. What is not å and not pra, what is fixed (stapding), that is a characteristic of the fifth day. Besides, the characteristics of the second day re-occur in the fifth, such as urdhva, prati, antar, vrişan, vridhan: the mentioning of the deity in the middle pada, an allusion to the airy region. (In addition to these, there are the following peculiar characteristics), dugdha, (duh to milk) udha (udder), dhenu (cow) przśni (cloud, cow) mad (drunk), the animal form, an increase (adhyásah),' for the animals differ in size, as it were, one being smaller or bigger than the other.' This (fifth) day is jagatam, i.e., it refers to the movable jagat) things (or the Jagati metre), for [381] the animals are movable ; it is bárhatam, for the animals have reference to the Bșihatî metre; it is páriktam, for the animals refer to the Pañkti metre; it is våman, i.e., left, because the animals are of this quality. It is havişmat, i.e., having offerings; because the animals 

* The Pašu is considered to have five feet, the mouth being reckoned as the fifth. Say

Sây. interprets the word váma here differently. He takes it to mean slovely, beautiful." This, he says, refers to the song (what song, he does not specify) which is pleasing to hear on account of its sweet tones and sounds, or to the beautiful view which animals, such

225 

are an offering (serve as an offering); it is rapuşmal, 1.2., having a body ; for the animals Lave a body; it is sakvaram pânictam, and has the present tense, just as the second day. 

Imam û şuvo atithin (6, 15) is the Ajya Sastra. It is in the Jagati metre with additional other metres (such as Sakvari, Atis akvari, &c.); this is the animal characteristic of the fifth day. 

The Pra-uga Sastra of the fifth day, which is in the Brihati metre, consists of the following verses : A no yajñam divisprisam (8, 90, 9-10), à no vâyo (8, 46, 25), rathena prithapd jasa (4, 46,5-7) bahavah sirachak şaså (7, 66, 10-12), imâ u vam diriştayo (7, 74, 1-3), piba sutasya rasino (8, 3, 1-3), devam deram vo vase deram (8, 27, 13-15) brihail 24 giyişe vacha ( 7, 96, 1-3). 

In the verse yat pañchajanyayarisi (8, 52, 7), which is the beginning of the Marutratiya Sastra, there is the word pâñchajanyayê (consisting of five families) which (five) is a characteristic of the fifth day (it being pankta, i. e., five-fold.) 

Indra åt somapa ekah (8, 2, 4), Indra nediya edihi (Val. 5, 5), uttistha Brahmanaspate (1, 40, 1), Agnir netd (3, 20, 1), tram soma kratubhik (1, 91, 2), (882) pinvanty apô (1, 64, 6), brihad Indrayo gayata (8, 78, 1) is the extension (of the Marutvatiya Sastra) of the fifth day, which is identical with that of the second day. 

Avitási sunvatô (8, 36) is a hymn which contains the word mad “to be drunk." There are (in the first verse) five padas, which is in the Pankti metre, all these are characteristics of the fifth day. Ittha hi soma in mada (1, 80) is another hymn in the Pankti metre, consisting of five padas which contains the word mad also. 

The hymn Indra piba tibiiyam suto madaya (6, 40), composed in the Triştubh metre, contains the word mad also. By means of this pada which remained firm, the Hotar keeps the libation in its proper place, preventing it from slipping down. The triplet marutvam indra midhva (8, 65, 7-9) is the setting containing neither the word å por pra which is a characteristic of the fifth day. These verses are in the Gyatri metre, which lead the midday libation of the three days' sacrifice. The Nivid is placed in that metre which is the leading one. Therefore the Hotar places the Nivid in (these) Gâyatris. 

as cows, horses, &c., represent to the eye of the spectator. But these explanations have no sense at all, and appear to be mere guesses. I think it beiter to take the word in the meaning ** left" according to which the animals are the “ left part" in creation, opposed to men and gods who represent the right. 

226 

(On the sakvara Sâman and the Mahåndninis. 

The Niskevalya Sastra.) - On the fifth day, which is a Rathantara day, the Sama singers chant the Mahânâmni verses according to the Sâkvara tune ; this is a charac teristic of the fifth day. Indra (having had once a desire of becoming great), made himself great by means of these verses; therefore they are called Mahânâmnî. These worlds (also) are Mahânâmnis, for they are great. [883] Prajapati had, when he created the universe, the power (of making all) this and everything. The power possessed by Prajâpati to make all this and everything when creating these worlds, became the Sakvari verses. Thence they are called Sakvaris (from saknoti, he has the power), He (Prajapatî) made them (these Mahânâmnis) to extend beyond the frontiers. All that he created as extending beyond the frontiers, turned cords (sima). Thence comes the word síman, from sima a cord. 

The verses Svádor itthâ vişūvato (1, 84, 10), upa no haribhih sutam (8, 82, 31), indram visva avivridhann (1, 111, 1), are the Anurûpa (of the Nişkevalya Sastra); they contain the words vrişan, priśni, mad, oridhan, which are characteristics of the fifth day. Yad vâvána (10, 74, 6) is the immovable Dhâyyâ. By repeating Abhi två śúra nonumo after the Dhâyya, the Hotar returns to the womb of the Rathantaram (as the receptacle of all ceremonies), this (fifth) day being a Rathantara day by its position. Mô $tu tu tậghatas chama (7, 32, 1-2) is the Sama Pragatha with an addi tional foot, having the animal form (five parts), which is a characteristic of the fifth day. Tyam şu vajinam is the immovable Tarkşya, 

8. (The Remainder of the Nişkevalya Sastra. The 

Sastras of the Evening Libation.) The hymn, predam brahma (8, 37) is in the Pańkti metre, comprising five padas. The hymn, Indro madáya vâvridha (1, 81) is in the Pankti metre, consisting of five padas, and containing the term "mad.” By means of the hymon Satrú madásas tava (6, 36, 1) which contains the term “nad" also, and is in the Triştubh metre, the Hotar keeps through its padas which remain firm, the libation in its proper place, [334] thus preventing it from falling down. The triplet, tam Indram vajay amasi (8, 82, 7-9) is the setting (paryâsa). (Its third pada) sa vrişâ vriş abho bhuvat, contains the animal from there is the word vrişan, i. e., 

* These are vidá maghavan, Bee 4, 4. 

hy

male, in it). It is in the Gâyarti metre, for the Gůyatris are the leading metres at the midday libation in this Tryaha (the three days from the fourth to the sixth). The Nivid is placed in that metre which is the leading. Therefore the Hotar places the Nivid in (these) Gayatris. 

The verses, tat saritur rrinimahe (6, 82, 1-3) au ya no dera savitar (5, 82, 13-15), are the beginning and sequel of the Vaišvadera Sastra on the Rathantara day, of which the fifth is one. Udu sya derah sarita damuna (6, 71, 4-6) is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar. In it there is the word vámam (in the last pada), 2.e., left, which is a characteristic of the animal form. In the Dyâvâprithivi hymn, mahi dyâróprithivi (4, 56) the words ruvad dhoksa (in the last pada) contain the animal form (be. cause the word dhokşa, from the root duh, to milk, is in it). 

Ribhur vibhvú vája (4, 34) is the Ribhu bymn. Because the auimals are vâjaħ, i. e., property, booty, which (rajah) is an animal form. Stuşe janam suvratart navyasíbhir (6, 49, 1) is a bymn (in the Triştubh metre) with an additional pada (in the last verse, which is in the Sakvari, instead of in the Triştubh metre). This is the animal form (animals being supposed to have fire feet instead of four, the mouth being counted as the fifth) which is a characteristic of the fifth day. Haviş pintam ajaram (10, 88,1) is the beginning of the Agnimaruta Sastra. It contains the word haviş, i, e., offering, which is a characteristic of the fifth day. Vapur na tachchikituşê (6, 66) is the (Nivid) hymn for the larutas, which con tains the word vapus, 2. e., from. Jatavedase sunarâma is the invariable Dhâyyâ. Agnir hata (335) grihapatih (6, 15, 13) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jâtavedâs, with an additional pada (at the end); this is the animal form, which is a characteristic of the fifth day. 

On the Rituyújas of the Sixth Day.) The sixth day is deva kşetra, i. e, the field of the gods. Those who enter on the sixth day, enter the field of the gods who do not live to gether, but each in his own house. They say, No Ritu (season) lives in the house of another Ritu. Therefore the priests perform the Ritu yâjas (offerings to the Ritus), each for himself, without appointing another one to do it for them. Thus the priests prepare all the Ritus 

5 This refers to the circumstance that at the common Soma sacrifices, such as ths Agnistoma, the Rituyaja mantra for the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer are repeated by the Hotar, and not by the Adhyaryu"and the sacrificer themselves. But at a Sattra, to which class of sacrifices the Drådasa ha belongs, this is not allowed; each must act for himself, each member of the body of priests who are performing a Sattra, being alternately priest and sacrificer. The Ritayaja mantras for the Adhvaryu and sacrificer are the eleventh and twelfth in order. See the note on page 135-36. 

228 

without foregoing such or such one (and make them fit for their own use), that the whole assemblage enjoys happiness, each in his own place. They say, No order for making the Ritu offering is required, nor is the formula " vậuşat” to be repeated. Because the order given (by the Maitra varuņa), for the Ritu offerings are the Vâch, who is wearied on the sixth day. When they would give the order (for repeating the Yâjyâs) for the Ritu offerings, and call "vâuşat," then they would have Vâch wearied, tired, sinking under her load (the number of mantras recited on the previous days) and faltering in her (886) voice. But if the priests do not repeat the order for the Ritu offerings, nor repeat vâuşat after the Yâjyâs, then they fall from the line of the sacrifice which should not be broken and consequently they fall) from the sacrifice, from the prâņa (breath), Prajapati and cattle, and will (henceforth) walk crooked. Therefore the order (praiga) to repeat the mantras, as well as the Yajyâ verse (at the end of which the Vaşatkâra occurs) should be preceded by a Rik verse. S Thus they will not have the Vâch wearied, tried, sinking beneath her load, faltering in her voice, nor will they fall from the line of sacrifice which should not be broken, nor from the sacrifice, nor from the prâņa, nor from Prajapati, nor from the cattle, nor walk crooked. 

10. (On the Nature and Meaning of the Paruchhepa Verses.) They place at the two first libations a Paruchhepa verse (one seen by the Rişi Paruchhepa) before each of the Yâjyâs, which are repeated by the seven Hotars in their order (the so-called prasthitas). The name of their metre is Rohita. By means of it Indra ascended the seven heavens. Thus he who has this knowledge ascends the seven heavens. They say, Verses which consist of five padas (steps) are a characteristic of the fifth day, and such ones as consist of six padas are fit for the sixth day, why then are metres of seven padas (as the Rohita is) [387] recited on the sixth day? (The reason is) By six steps the sixth day is reached ; but by cutting off, as it were, the seventh day (by taking it single) they settle with the seventh step down (in heaven after baving reached it by six). Thus they regain the Vâch for the connection (of the whole). Those who are possessed of such a knowledge have the three days connected and un broken. 

NU 

• Riknavahi ; tikra=bhagna, broken, stands, as say. observes, instead of urrkna. * Fanarâvini. * The verse to be prefixed to the Praisa and Yájyâ is tubhyam hinvaná (2, 30, 1). 

* Previons to the recital of every Yajyå, one of the Parucbhepa verses is to be repeated. These are, zrisaun indra vrişa pânâsa indavan (1, 130, 6-11) and piba somam indra suvanam(1, 130, 2-10), 

229 

11. (On the Origin of the Paruchhepa Verees.) The Devâs and Asuras waged war in these worlds. The Depas turned the Asuras by means of the sixth day's ceremonies out of these worlds. The Asuras seized all things which they could grasp, took them and threw them into the sea. The Devas following them behind seized by means of this metre (of the Paruchhepa verses which have seven padas) all they (the Asuras) had grasped. Just this pada, viz., the additional pada (the seventh in the Paruchhepa verses) became a hook for the purpose of gathering the treasures (thrown into the sea by the Asuras). Therefore he who has this knowledge, deprives his enemy of his fortune and turns him out of all these worlds. 

12 (The Characteristics of the Sixth Day. The Sastras of the Morning and 

Midday Libations.) Heaven (Dydus) is the leading deity of the sixth day. The Stoma is the thirty-three-fold, the Sâman is Raivatam, Atichhandâs the metre. What has the same end (refrain) is a characteristic of the sixth day. [838] The sixth day has the same characteristics as the third, viz. the words, aśra, anta, end, repetition, consonance, cohabitation, paryasta (set), three, what has the form of anta; the mentioning of the deity in the last pada, an allusion to that world (heaven). The peculiar characteristics of the sixth day are, the Paruchhepa hymns comprising seven padas, the Narasamsam, the Nabhânediştham, the Raivatam the Atichhandah, and the past tense. 

Ayam jayata manuşo dharimani (1, 128) is the Ajya Sastra, which is a Paruchhepa hymn, an Atichhandah (a metre exceeding the normal measure) comprising seven padas, which is a characteristic of the sixth day. 

The Pra-uga Sastra consists of the following verses, which all are Paruchbepa, and Atichhandah, comprising seven padas : stirnam barhir up no yahi vitaye (1, 135, 1-3), å vám ratho niyutvän (1, 135, 4-6); suşuma yatam adribhir (1, 137, 1-3); yuvám stomebhir devayanto (1, 139, 4-6); avar maha (1, 133, 6-7); astu śrâuşa? (1, 139, 1); O $u no agne śrinuhi tvam ilitô (1, 139, 7); ye devâso divy ekâdasa (1, 139, 11); iyam adadâd rabhasam (6, 61, 1-3). 

Sa púrryô mahânám (8, 52, 1-3) is the beginning of the Marutvatiya Sastra, because mahan is a word in anta (acc. mahántan), and anta, i. e., 

10 Anuhdyq=przşthato gatvá S. 

230 

end, is a characteristic of the sixth day, being the end (the last of the second series of three days). The verses, Traya indrasya Soma (8, 2, 7-9); Indra nediya edihi (Vâl. 5, 5-6); pra núnam Brahmanaspatir (1, 40, 5-6); Agnir netâ (3, 20, 4); tvam Soma kratubhiḥ (1, 91,2), pirvanty apô (1, 64, 6); and nakih sudasô ratham are the extension (âtanaḥ of the Marutvatîya Sastra) and identical with those of the third day. 

Yan tvam ratham indra medha sâtaye (1, 129) is a Paruchhepa hymn in the Atichhandâh metre, consisting [389] of seven padas. Sa yo vrışd vrisnyebhiḥ (1, 100) is the hymn whose verses have the same refrain?? (sama nodarka). Indra Marutvä iha påhi (3, 51, 7) is the hymn," which contains an anta, (a participle of present tense form in ant, or its equiva lent) in the words (verse 9), tebhiḥ sākam pibatu vritrakhâdah ; because vritrakhádô (adó being taken as equivalent to anta) is the anta, and the sixth day is the end (anta). By means of this hymn, which is in the Triştubh metre, the Hotar keeps through its padas which remain firm, the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling. Ayam ha yena (10, 65, 4-6) is the triplet which serves as a setting, for in its words, svar marutvatâ jitam, there is an anta, jita is an anta.1: These verses are in the Gâyâtri metre; the Gâyatris are the leading metres at the midday libation during these three days. The Nivid is put in the leading metre; thence the Hotar puts the Nivid in the Gâyâ tri metre. 

The verses, revatir na sadhamâde (1, 30, 13-15), and revân id (8, 2, 13-15), form the Raivata Priştha (the Raivaita Sâma), which is used on a Bribat day, to which the sixth day belongs. The verse yad vávána is the invariable Dhâyyâ. By “ tvån iddhi havámahê” (6, 46, 1-2) which follows the Dhâyyâ, the Hotar returns all to the womb of the Bțihat Sâma ; for this is a Brihat day according to its position. Indram id devatâtaya (8, 3,5-6) is the Sâma Pragâtha which has the characteristic of ninrila (has a consonance),24 Tyam û şu vâjinam is the invariable Târkşya. 

13 [840] (The Remainder of the Nişkevalya Sastra and the Sastras of the 

Evening Libation.) Endra yahy upa naḥ (1, 130) is the Paruchhepa hymn, in the Aticbhan dâh metre, comprising seven padas. Pra gha nvasya (2, 15) is the hyma whose several verses have the same refrain. 18 In the hymn abhur eko 

1 This is Marutván ro bhavatv indra úti. 1* In the present state of the Samhità it is incorporated with another one. 15 This appears to be an error, the form ant is to be sought in marutvata. 

34 Because in every pada there is the word Indra, the ropetition of which resein bles the sounding of a bell metal instrument.-- Sây. 

15 This is mada indra chakara.

pood 

rayipate (6, 31), the words occur (verse 5) artham stisthira twvintima bhimam ; in it the word stha " to stand, ” marks an end (standing being the end of going) which is a characteristic of the sixth day. By means of this hymn, which is in the Triştubh metre, the Hotar keeps, through its padas which remain firm, the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling. Upa no harilnih stutam (8, 82, 31-33) is the setting which has the same refrain. It is in the Gayatri metre, which is the leading one of the midday libation of the three (latter) days. Therefore the Nivid is to be placed in it. Abhi taym deram Savitâran (Vaj. Samb. 4, 25) is the beginning of the Vaišvadeva Sastra, in the Atichhanda metre. Tat Savitur varenyam (3, 62, 10-11) and doşô agât from the sequel, because gata, i.e., gone, signifies an end, which is a characteristic of the sixth day. 

Uduşya devah savitâ savaya (2, 38) is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar; the words therein, sasvattamam tadapa vannir asthát, contain an anta, for sthita, i.e., standing is an anta. 

Katarâ phrva (1, 185, 1) is the (Nirid) bymn for Dyâvâprithivi, whose verses have the same refrain.18 

Kim u śreşthah kirin yarişthô (1, 161) and upo no râja adhvaran ribhukşa (4, 37) form the Arbhavam [341] Narasamgam hymns, in which the term " three” occurs, being a characteristic of the third day. 

The two hymns Idam itthå raudram (10, 61), and ye yajñena dakşż nayâ samakta (10, 62) form the Vaišvadeva (Nábhânediştha) hymns. 

14. (The Story of Nabhânediştha, the son of Manu.) He recites the Nâbhânediştham. Nâbhânediştha was a son of Manu; who was given to the sacred study (after his investiture in the house of his Guru); 17 his brothers deprived him of his share in the paternal pro perty. He went (to them) and said, " What portion is left to me?" They answered, " Go to the adjudicator 1s and arbitrator." By "adjudicator and arbitrator " they meant their father. He went to his father and said, * They have divided the property including my share among themselves." The father answered, “My dear son, do not mind that. There are the Angirasah just engaged in holding their sacrificial session (Sattra) for going to heaven. As often as they commence the ceremonies of the sixth day, they are puzzled (frustrated in their design). Let them recite on the sixth day those two hymns (abovementioned, Rigveda 10, 61-62), then they will give thee the sum of a thousand which is contributed by all the. 

10 This is dydva raksatan prithivi no abhvát. ** This is the meaning of the term brahmacharyam vasantam. 18 Nistava.232 

sacrificers who participate in the sacrificial session, 29 when they go to heaven.” He said, “Well, let it be so.” He then went to them, saying, “Receive me, the son of Manu, among you, O ye wise !!! They said, "What dost thou wish, that thou speakest thus ?" He answered, (342] " I will show you how to perform the sixth day, then give me the reward for the sacrificial session of a thousand (cows or other valuables), when you go up to heaven." They said, “ Well, let it be so." He made them recite on the sixth day those two hymns; then they became aware of the Yajña (the sacrifice regarded as a person, leading to heaven), and of the heaven-world. Therefore the Hotar recites those two hymns on the sixth day, in order that the sacrificer might become aware of the sacrifice, and to have subsequently pointed out the heaven-world. When: they were going up, they said, “This thousand, 0 Brâhmaņa, belongs to thee." When he was putting all together (the thousand pieces), a man clothed in a blackish (dirty) dress ao alighted and approaching him, said, " This is mide ; I have left it here.” He answered, " The Angirasah have given it to me," The man said " Then it belongs to either of us, thy father may decide." He went to his father. He asked him, "Have they not, my dear son, given you (the reward) ?” He said, “They have given me; but a man clothed in a blackish dress alighted, and approaching me said, “This is mine, I have left it here. So saying, he took it.” The father said, "It is his, my dear son ! but he will give it to thee." He went back to him, and said, " Sir, this belongs only to you ; so says my father." He said, "I give it to thee, because you have spoken the truth, (i.eu, acknowledged that it is my property)." Therefore a man who is learned must speak only the truth. This is the mantra of "the thousand gifts," the Nabhânediştha hymn. Upon that man who has this knowledge, a thousand gifts shower, and he gets a glimpse of heaven by means of the sixth day. 

15. 

(343) On the auxiliary Sastras at the Evening Libation, Nábhånediştha, Valakhilya, the Sukirti Hymn, Vrişů kapi, and Evayámarut. The Agna mdruta Sastra of the Sixth Day. (See 6, 27-30.) 

The Hotar ought to repeat those Sastras which are called the accompaniments (of the others on the sixth day), viz., the Nabhanediş tham, Valakbilyâ, Vripäkapi and Evayâmaruta only as auxiliaries (to the Vaišvadeva-Sastra). If the Hotar foregoes only one of them, 

Is This is the translation of sattra-pariveşanan. ** Siy, says that according to another Sakbà, this man is Rudra, the master of cattle. 

233 

(these additional Sastras, the sacrificer will lose somethiug. If he foregoes the Nábbânediştham, then the sacrificer will lose his semen ; if he foregoes the Vâlakhilgås, then the sacrificer will lose his breath; if he foregoes the Vrişá kapi, the sacrificer will lose his soul; and if he foregoes the Evayáinarutam, then he will turn the sacrificer out of his divine and human position. By means of the Nabhanediş tham, he (the priest) poured the semen into the sacrificer ; by means of the Vålakbilyâ verses, he transformed them to make an embryo). By means of the hymn *1 by Sukirti, the son of Kaksivat, he made the Tomb set forth the child, because therein in the first verse is said), “Let us rejoice in thy shelter, Indra ! (just as people find pleasure in a large commodious roon)." Thence the child (garbha), though being larger, does not damage the womb which is (much) smaller. If the Tomb is pre pared by (this) sacred hymn (Brahma, the Sukirti hymn), then the Hotar imparts to the sarcificer the faculty of walking by means of the Evayâmaruta hymn (6, 87). If he has done all required for making the sacrificer walk, then be walks (he has obtained the faculty of walking). 

Ahaścha krişnam anar arjunam (6, 9, 1-33) is the beginning of the Agnimâruta Sastra, because ahas (344) is a repetition, and a consonance, which is a characteristic of the sixth day. Madhto ko nama marutam yajatra (7, 57) is the Maruta bymp. Here is the plural (because the Marutas are many) to be urged ; because the plural is an anta, and this is a characteristic of the sixth day. 

Jätavedase sunavana (1, 99, 1), is the invariable Jâtavedås verse. Sa pratnatha sahasa (1, 96, 1) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jậtavedas, whose verses have the same refrain, which is a characteristic of the sixth day. 

The priest, apprehending the anta, i. e., ends of the sacrifice, might fall down, keeps them up by repeating twice the word dharayan,22 i. e, they may hold, just as one ties and unties successively the ends of a cord, 38 or just as one (a tanner) is driving in the end of a (wetted) skin a peg, in order to keep it (expanded). It is done to keep the sacrifice uninterrupted Those who have such a knowledge have the three days continuous and unbroken (undisturbed). 

21 Apa pracha Indra (10, 131). 22 It is in the last pada of all verses of this hrinn, 23 In order to make of them a large ring.

THIRD CHAPTER (The Characteristics and Sastras of the Seventh and Eighth Days.) 

16. (The Characteristics of the Seventh Day. The Sastras of the Morning 

and Midday Libation.) 

• The terms a and pra are the characteristics of the seventh day. The seventh day is just like the first, yakta, ratha, đšu, piba, the deity mentioned in the first pada, the allusion to this world (earth,) jata, anirukta, karişyat (future), these are the characteristics of the seventh day. 

[845] Samudrád úrmim (10, 123, 2) is the Ajya hymn. Here is something hidden (aniruktam, i, e, not explicitly stated) which is a characteristic of the seventh day. In the sea (Samudra) is Vâch; because neither the sea becomes (over) extinct, nor Vâch. Thence this (hymn) is the Ajya (Sastra) of the seventh day. From the Yajña (sacrifice) only, the Hotar thus extends the sacrifice, and thus they recover Vách again (to continue the sacrifice). The Stomas are at an end, the meters are at an end on the sixth day. Just as (at the Darsapûrnamâsa Isti) they cause to drip upon the pieces of sacrificial food drops of melted butter (âżya), in order to make them bot again for recovering its essence already gone ; in the same way, they recover the Stomas and meters for regaining (the essence of the sacrifice again by this Ajya Sastra of the seventh day. It is in the Triştubh metrs; because this is the metre at the morning libation during the last) three days. 

The Pra-uga Sastra consists of the following mantras : â váyo bhúsa (7, 92, 1), prayabhir yasi (7, 92, 3) à no niyudbhih satinir 17, 92, 5), pra sota jiro adhvareşv asthát (7, 92, 2), ye vayava indra mada masu (7,92, 4), gà tâm satam (7, 91, 6), o nha god oam Mitravana (6, 67, 9-11), d gomatâ nâsatya (7, 72, 1-3), & no deva savasâ (7, 30, 1-3) pra vo yajñeşu (7, 43, 1-3), pra kşodasă dhấyasă (7, 95, 1-3). In these verses there are the characteristics of the [846) seventh day, â and pra, contained. They are in the Triştubh metre, because this is the metro at the morning libation during the (last) three days. 

* With the sixth day, the sacrifice is finished. Vâch is done up; but the priest commences now developing the Yajõa again. This can be done only by starting from the Yajõa itself (without any other help), and recovering the Vâch in the form of this allusion. 

2 All this is implied in the expression pratyabhigharayan. 

a These six verses form two triplets; they all are so called ekapatinis, and consti tute the two triplets for Våyu and Indra respectively, which are always required at the Pra-uga sastra. 

235 

A två račham yathotaya, (8, 57, 1-2) idam vaso suta in andali (8, 2, 1-2), Indra nediya ed ihi (Vál. 5, 5-6), praitu Brahmanaspatir (1, 40, 3-4), Agnir netá (3, 20, 4), tram soma kratubhih (1, 91, 2), pintanty apah (1, 64,6), pra va indraya brihate (8, 78, 3), are the eztension of the Marut vatiya Sastra) of the seventh day, identical with that of the first. 

In the hymn, Kaya śubhā sarayaśah (1, 165) (9th verse), in the words na jiyamano naśate, na jata the term játa occurs, which is one of the characteristics of the seventh day. This is the Kaydśubhiya hymn which effects unanimity (among people) and prolongs life. By means of it Indra, Agastya, and the Marats became (unanimous). By reciting the Kayâśubhîyam hymn, the Hotar produces unanimity. But it bears upon the prolongation of life also. Who desires that, may have repeated the Kayaśubhiyam. It is in the Triştubb metre. By means of its pada which remains firm, the Hotar keeps the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling down. 

The hymn, tyam su meşam mahaya (1, 52) contains (in the second pada of the first verse) the words atyam na vājam haranasyadamratham, the 

term ratha, 2.e., carriage, being a characteristic of the seventh day. It is in the Jagatî metre, for the Jagatis are the leading metres at the midday libation of these three last days. The Nivid is placed in that metre which is the leading; thence one places (here) the Nivid in the 

Jagatis. 

The hymns representing cohabitation are now repeated"; they are in the Tristubh and Jagati metres. Because cattle is represented by cohabitation and [847) the Chandomas * are cattle and calculated for obtaining cattle. Tvâm iddhi havámahs, and tvan hy ehi (848) cherats (8, 50, 1-2) form the Brihat Pristha on the seventh day. The same Prişthas take place as on the sixth day. The Vairûpam (Sâma) belongs 

"The Chandomâh are three peculair Stomas, which are required on the three last days of Navaratra, or the seventh, eighth, and nixth days of the Dvadasaha and the same of these three days themselves. They are minutely described in the Tagdya Brahmana. 3, 8-13. These Stomas are, the twenty-four-fold (chaturvimša), the forty-fous-fold (chatus chatyarimsa), and the forty-eight-fold (aştáchatváriíśa). The verses required for chanting the Chandomâh on the three last days of Navaratra are (according to the Udget tri prayoga of the Dvadasaha) all put together in the second part of the Sâmavedârchi kam, commencing with the second Ardha of the fourth Prapathaka (pra kävyan usaneva), and ending with the fifth Prapathaka with the verse Yzüksvä hi resina hari). The order is, on the seventh day, all kama verses are put in the twenty-four-fold. Stoma, on the eighth all are chanted according to the forty-four-fold Stona ia three varieties, on the ninth all are put in the forty-eight-fold Stoma, of which there are two varieties enumerated. There is here no change of the Stomas according to the libations, as it is in the Agnistoma and the cognate sacrifices. That Stoma, in which the first Stotram 

236 

to the Rathantaram ; the Vairâjam to the Bșihat; the Sakvaram to the Rathantaram, and the Raivatam to the Brihat. Therefore (because the Raivatam representing the Brihat was chanted on the sixth day) the Bribat Piştha takes place on the seventh day); for they fasten through that Brihat (of the sixth day), the Bribat (of the seventh day) to prevent the cutting off of the Stomas ; for, if the Rathantaram (which is opposed to the Brihat) is used, then the union (of the sixth and seventh days) is destroyed. Therefore only the Bribat is to be used (on the seventh day.) 

Yad våvána is the immovable Dhâyyâ. By the subsequent recital of the Rathantaram abhi två súra nonumah, the Hotar brings all back to the womb; for this is a Rathantara day according to its position. Piba suta. sya rasinah (8, 3, 1-2) is the Sâma Pragatha, which has pība, one of the characteristics of the seventh day. Tyam û şu vajinan is the invariable Tarkşya. 

(The Remainder of the Nişkevalya Sastra. The Sastras of the Even ing Libation, 

Indrasya nu viryani (1, 32) is a hymn which has the characteristic word pra of the seventh day. It is (349) in the Triştubh metre. By 

(the Bahis-pavamana) is chanted, remains in force for the whole day. The Bahiş-pava månas of all three days, generally contain as many verses as the Stoma has members. So, for instance, the Bahiş-pavamâna of the seventh day consists of 24 verses (Sâmaveda ii. 465-88), for the twenty-four-fold Stoma is reigning during this day; the Bahis-pava mâna of the eighth day consists of forty-four verses (Samaveda ii. 524-67), for the Stoma reigning during this day is the forty-four-fold, &c. The four Sâmans which follow the Babiş-pavamana Stotras at the midday libation, are called äjyáni, the four which follow the Pavamâna Stotras at the midday liba tion, go by the name of Pristhäni, and the four which follow the Arbhava-pavamana Stotra at the evening libation are called uthani. Now the ajyani, pristhani and ukthåni generally consist either of three or even only two verses. If they consist of only two verses, they are to be made three, just as is the case with the Rathantara, Náudhasa, and Kaleya Priştha at the Agnistoma. The three verses then are, in three turns; so often to be repeated, as to yield twenty-four, forty-four, or forty-eight. Each turn of the twenty-four-fold Stoma contains, for inse tance, eight verses, in three divisions, in the following order: 

1.82,3;6,4;0,1: II. S a, 1; 1,3; C, 4: III, 8-2,4;0,1; 0, 8. In the forty-four-fold Stoma, the repetitions are arranged in the following way : I. 15-1, 3, 5, 11;c, 1: II. 14-0,1; 6,3; c, 10: III. 15-0, 11;0,1; C, 3. The forty-eight-fold Stoma is as follows: 1.16--3; b, 12; C, 1: II. 16-4,1; 0,3; 6, 12: III. 10 -a, 12; 6,1; 0, 3. 

The forty-eight-fold Stoma is the last of the Stomas ; thence it is called anta, The Chandomab are said to have the animal form. According to the Tâpdya Brahm, (3,8), the animals have eight hoofs, thence are eight verses required in each turn when the twenty-four-fold Stona is made ; or, they are said (8, 12) to consist of sixteen pieces ; thence are sixteen verses in each turn required when the forty-eight-fold Stomā is made.

means of the pâdas which remain firm, the Hotar keeps the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling down. 

Abhi tyam meşam puruhůtam (1, 51, 1) is a hymn in which pra is replaced by abhi, forming a characteristic of the seventh day. It is in the Jagati metre, because the Jagatís are the leading metres at the midday libation. Therefore the Nivid is to be placed in it. 

These hymns representing cohabitation are now repeated, which are in the Triştubh and Jagati metres; because cohabitation represents cattle, and the Chandomâs represent cattle ; (this is done) in order to obtain cattle. 

Tat savitar vinâmahe (5, 82, 1-3), adya no deva Saritar (5, 82, 3-5) are the beginning and sequel of the Vaišvadeva Sastra in the Rathan tara days, on the seventh day. Abhi två deca Savitar (1, 24, 3) is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar, which contains instead of pra the word abhi, which is identical with pra, a characteristic of the seventh day. 

Pretâm yajñasya (2, 41, 19) is the (Nivid) hymn for Dyâvâprithivi, which contains the word pra. Ayam devāya janmana (1, 20, is the (Nivih hymn for the Ribhus, which contains the word jan, to be born. 

He repeats now the verses, consisting of two pâdas, commencing dyâhi ranasa saha, (10, 172, 1); for man has two feet, and animals have four ; animals are represented by the Chandomas. (This is done) for obtaining cattle. If he repeats these verses which consist of two feet, then he places the sacrificer, who has two legs, among the four-footed cattle. 

Abhir agne duvo (1, 14) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Vißvedevâh, which has the characteristic â of the seventh day. It is in the Gayatri metre; for (850) the third libation is headed by the Gâyatri during these three days. 

Visvánaro ajtjanat is the beginning of the Agnimâruta Sastra, which contains the word jan, to be born. Pra yad vas triştu' ham (8,7) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas, which has the word pra. Jätaredase sunavama (1, 99, 1) is the invariable Jätavedås verse. Dutam ro ciśvave dasam (4, 8) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jatavedâs, where the name (Jatave das) is not explicitly mentioned (only hinted at). All these are in the Gayatri metre; for the third libation on these three days is headed by the Gayatri.

18. (The Characteristics of the Eighth day. The Sastras of the Morning, and Midday Libations.) 

Neither the words à nor pra, but what is "standing" is the character istic of the eighth day; because the eighth is identical with the second. The characteristics are, ûrdhvel, prati, antar, vrişan, vridhan, the men tioning of the deity in the middle pâda, an allusion to the airy region, iwice the name Agni (in the same pada), the words mahad, vihuta punar, the present tense. 

Agnim vo devam agnibhih (7, 3) is the Ajya of the eighth day ; bacausa it contains twice the word agni. It is in the Triştubh metre ; for the Triştubh is the leading metre at the morning libation during these three days. The Pra-uga Sastra is composed of the following verses : Kuvid anga namasa (7, 91, 1,) pivo annan (7, 91, 3,) uchhan uşasaḥ (7, 90, 4), uśantá důtâ (7, 91, 2,) yavat taras (7, 91, 4-5,) prati vám súra udite (7, 65, 1-3,) dhenuh pratnasya (3, 58, 1-3), Brahmana indropa (7, 28, 1-3, ürdhvo agnih sumatim (7, 39, 1-3) uta syd naḥ sarasvati (7,95, 4-6). In these verses are the characteristics (851) prati, antar, vihůta, urdhvai contained; they are in the Triştubh metre, which is the leading metre at the morning libation on these three days. 

The extension (of the Marutvatiya Sastra) consists of the following verses : Visvanarasya vaspatim (8, 57, 4), Indra it Somapâ ekah (8, 2, 4), Indra nediya ed ihi (Val. 5, 5-6), uttiştha Brahmanspate (1, 40, 1-2), agnir netâ tvan Soma kratubhih, pinvanty apo, brihad indraya gâyata. This Sastra is identical with that of the second day. 

Now follow the Mahadvat hymns, i, e., such ones as contain the word mahat, great. These are) sarsâ mahâm (3, 49), mahaśchit tvam (1, 169), pibd somam abhi yam (6, 17), in the words úrvam gavyam mahi, maham Endro nrivat (6, 19). This hymn is in the Trişțubh metre; by means of its pâdas which remain firm, the Hotar keeps the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling down. 

Tam asya dyâvâ prithivi (10,113) is a mahadvat hymn also; for, in the second pâda of the first verse, the word mahimano occurs. It is in the Jagatî metre. The Jagatis are the leading metres at the midday liba tion during the three last days (above-mentioned). Thence the Nivid is placed in it. These hymns represent cohabitation ; they are in the Tris tabh and Jagati metres, for cattle is represented by cohabitation, and, for obtaining cattle, the mahadvat hymns are repeated. The air is mahad, in order to obtain the airy region, five hymns (there are five, four in Tiiş 

239 

ţubh, and one in Jagati) are required. For the Paukti metre comprises five pâdas, the sacrifice belongs to this metre, cattle belong to it; cattle is represented by the Chandomâs. 

Abhi två śúra nonumah, and abhi trâ prirvapitaye form the Rathanta ram Přiştham of the eighth day. Yad vâvâna is the invariable Dhâyya. By tvôm iddhi harámahe all is brought back to the womb; [352] for this day is a Bârbata day according to its position. Ubhayam srinarachcha (8, 50, 1-2) is the Sâma Pragatha; the meaning of ubhayam i. e., both, in it is, what is to-day and what was yesterday. This is a characteristic of the eighth day, which is a Bșihat day. Tyam 2 şu vajinam is the invari. able Târkşya. 

19. (The Mahadvat Hymns of the Nişkevalya Sastra. 

The Sastras of the Evening Libation.) The five Mahadvat hymns are, apúrvyâ purutaindni (6, 32), tâm sul te Kirtim (10, 54), tuan mahan Indra yo ha (1., 63), tram mahan indra tubhyam (4, 17). These (four) hymns are in the Triştubh metre; by means of its pâdas which remain firm, the Hotar keeps the libation in its proper place, preventing it from falling down. The fifth is in the Jagati metre, viz., divaschid asya varima (1, 55), which contains in the words, indram na mahnd, the term mahat, great. For obtaining cattle these Mahad vat hymns are repeated. The air is mahat, and for obtaining the airy region two times five hymns must be repeated. Because a Parkti (@ collection of five hymns) has five feet, the Yajña consists of five parts, cattle consist of five parts. Twice five makes ten ; this decade is Virát, Virât is food, cattle are food, the Chandomås are cattle. 

Viśvo devasya netus (5,50, 1), tat savitur varenyar á ris vedevam sapta tim (5, 82, 7-8), are the beginning and sequel of the Vaišvadeva Sastra. Hiranyapdnim utaye (1, 22, 5-7), which contains the word Ardhta, is the (Nivid) hymn for Savitar. Mahi dyâuh prithiri chana (1, 22, 13-15) is the (Nivid) hymn for Dyâvâprithivi, which contains the word mahat. Yuvána (853) pitarâ punar (1, 20, 4-8) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Ribhus, which has the characteristic word "punah." 

Imâ nu kam bhuvand (10, 157) is the hymn which contains only verses of two feet. For man has two feet, whilst the animals have four, and by 

Say --The five Mahadvat hymns of the Marutvatîya, and the five of the Nişkevalyn Sastras are to be understood, 

* It contains five verses, which are called Dvipadů Tristabh. (6áy, in his Commentary. on the Samhita.) 

240 

means of this hymn he places the two-footed sacrificer among the four footed cattle, Devânám id avo mahad (8, 72, 1) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Vißvedevås, which contains the term mahat. These verses are in the Gâyatri metre (except the Dvipâds), because the Gayatri is the leading metre at the evening libation during these three (last) days. 

By ritåvånam vaiśvånaram (Asv. Sr. S. 8, 10, commences the Agni mâruta Sastra ; because in the word agnir vaisvanaro mahón, there is the word nahat contained. Krilam van sardho mårutam (1, 37) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas ; because it contains (in the fifth verse) the word vavridhe, which is a characteristic of the eighth day. 

Jätavedase sunavama is the invariable Jâtavedâs verse. Agne mrila mahân asi (4, 9) is the (Nivid) hymn for Jâ tavedâs; it contains the cha racteristic term mahad. All these verses are in the Gâyatri metre, which is the leading) metre at the evening libation during these three (last) days.

FOURTH CHAPTER. (The Ninth and Tenth Days of the Dvadašaha. Conclusion 

of this Sacrifice.) 

20. (The Characteristics of the Ninth Day. The Sastras of the Morning and 

Midday Libations.) What has the same refrain, is a characteristic of the ninth day. This day has the same characteristics as [854] the third, viz., aśva, anta, punara vrättam, punarninrittam, rata, paryasta, the number three, antarúpa, the mentioning of the deity in the last pada, an allusion to that world, suchi splendour, satya truth, kşeti to reside, gata gone, oka house, the past tense. 

Aganma maha namasî (7,12, 1) is the Ajya hymn of the ninth day, because it contains the word " gone" (in aganma, we went), it is in the Triştubh metre. 

The Pra-uga Sastra consists of the following verses : pra vírya (7, 90, 1), te te satyena manasa (7, 90, 5), divi kşayanta (7, 64, 1), â visva várd (7, 70, 1-3), ayam soma indra tubhyam sunva (7, 29, 1-3), pra Brahmano (7, 42, 1-3, Sarasvatam devayanto (10, 17, 7-9), a no divo brihataḥ (5, 43, 11-13), Sarasvaty abhi no (6, 61, 14-16). These verses have the characteristics, suchi i.e., splendour; satya, i e, truth; kşeti, i.e , residence ; gate, i.e., gone ; oka, i.e., house. They are in the Triştubb metre, which is the (leading) metre at the morning libation, during the three (last) days. 

The extension (of the Varutyatiga Sastra) is the same as on the third day. The five hymns representing cohabitation which contain the cha racteristics of this day, and represent cattle, are, Indra staha pibotak (3, 50); sváha here is an anta ; gâyat súma nabhanyam (1, 173, which contains an anta in the word sear; tişthi hari ratha (335), which contains an anta in stha, to stand ; ima u tvâ purutam asya (6, 21), which contains an anta in rathestha. These four are in the Triştubh metre. The ifth is in the Jagati metre, pra mandine piłumat (1, 101), whose Terses have the same re frain. The Jagatis being the leading metre on the three (last) days, the Nivid is to be put in them. These hymns in the Triştubb and Jagati metres are repeated as (representing) cohabitation. For cattle is cobabitation ; the Chandomâs are (355) cattle. (This is done for obtaining cattle. Five (such) hymns are repeated. For the Pankti consists of five pâdas ; the sacrifice has the nature of the Parkti, and so have cattle (also); the Chandomâh are cattle ; (this is done) for obtaining cattle. 

Trâm iddhi hacâmalic and tram hichi cherare, form the Brihat Priştha. Yad vâvâna is the invariable Dâyyå. By abhi toa stiro nonumo all is brought to the womb, because the ninth day is a Rathantara day accord ing to its position. Indra tridhatu saranam (0, 46, 9-10) is the Sama Pragatha containing the characteristic “three." (The Târkşya just as on the other days.) 

21. (The Remainder of the Niskovalya Sastra. The Sastras of the Evening Libation.) 

There are five other pair-hypns enumerated, the four first are in the Triştubh, the fifth in the Jagatî metre. These are, sani cha tre jagmur (6.34), which contains the word "gone;” kada bhuran (6,35) which con tains the word "kşi" to reside, (in kşayani), which is an antarúpa, “le resides as it were, gone to an end (having gained his object)," å satyo yátu (4, 16) which contains satya truth, tat ta indriyam paramam (1, 103), which contains an anta in the word "paramam," 1. €., highest. Aham Uhuvam (10, 48, 1), which contains an anta in jayami, I conqueri. 

The commencement and sequel of the Vaišvadeva Sastra is, tat Sari tur prinimahe, and adyâ no deva Savitar. (The Nivid) hymn for Savitar is doşa âgât (?). The (Nivid) hymn for Dyâvâprithivi is, praram nahi dynvi abht (4,-56, 5-7). 

(856] Indra işe dadatu rah (8, 82, 34), te no rat nâui (1, 20, 7-8) form the (Nivid) hymn for the Ribhus, the words trira saptúni (1, 20, 7) contain 

For the sentences hero omitted in the translation (ther are only reuocirions, 300 . 19.242 

the characteristic "three." Babhrur eko vişunaḥ (8, 29) is the Dvipada, By repeating a Dvipâd, the Hotar puts the two-legged sacrificer among the four-legged animals. Ye trimsati trayas para (8, 28) is the (Nivid) hymn for the viśvedevah, because it contains the term "three." Vaišvånaro no ataye (AŚy Sr. S. 8, 11) is the Pratipad of the Agnimâruta Sastra ; it contains the term parávatah, which is an anta, 

Maruto yasya hi kşaya (1, 86) is the (Nivid) hymn for the Marutas. It contains the term kşi, to reside, which is an antarúpam; for one resides, as it were, after having gone to a certain) object. 

The (Nivid) hymn for Jâtavedâs is, prágnaye vâcham frayo (10. 187) (each verse of which ends with) sa naḥ pârşad ati dvişah, 2. e., may he (Agni) overcome our enemies, and bring (safely our ceremonies) to a conclusion. He repeats this refrain twice. For in this Navarâtra sacrifice (which is lasting for nine days), there are so many ceremonies, that the committal of a mistake is unavoidable. In order to make good any such mistake, the pâda mentioned must be repeated twice). By doing so, the Hotar makes them (the priests and sacrificers) free from all guilt. These verses are in the Gâyatri metre ; for the Gaya tri is the leading) metre at the evening libation during the three (last) days. 

(T. What the Different Parts of the Dvadasaha are to be likened. The Tenth Day.) 

The six Priştha days (the six first in the Dvadasaha) represent the mouth ; the Chandomâḥ days, from the seventh to the ninth, are then what is (857) in the mouth, as tongue, palate, and teeth ; but that by which one produces articulate sounds of speech, or by which one distin guishes the sweet and not sweet, this is the tenth day. Or the six Pris tha days are comparable to the nostrils, and what is between them, to the Chandomâı days ; but that by which one discerns the different smells, this is the tenth day. Or the six Pţiştha days are comprable to the eye ; the Chandomáh are then the black in the eye, and the tenth day then is the pupil of the eye, by which one sees. Or the six Přiştha days are comparable to the ear; while the Chandomâḥ represent what is in the ear; but by what one hears, that is the tenth day. 

The tenth day is happiness ; those who enter on the tenth day, enter on happiness, therefore silence must be kept during the tenth day ; for 

are then thoich one see omah repres 

243 " we shall not bespeak the (goddess of) fortane," because a happy thing is not to be spoken to. 

Now the priests walk, clean themselves, and proceed to the place of the sacrificer's wife (patnišâlà). That one of the priests, who should know this invocation offering (âhuti), shall say : 

"Hold one another ;" then he shall offer the oblation by repeating the mantra, “here be thou happy, here be yo happy, here may be a hold, here may be a hold for all that is yours ;* may Agni carry it (the sacrifice) up! Svâhâu ! may he take it up!" 

When he says, " be happy here," then he makes happy joyful) all those (sacrificers) who are in this (358) world. When he says, “ enjoy yourselves," then he makes joyful their offspring in these worlds. When he says, " here may be a hold, a hold for all that is yours," then he provides the sacrificers with children, and speech (the power of speech). By the words “may Agni carry it up " (vát), the Rathantaram Sâman is to be understood, and by "Svâhâ ! may he carry it up !" the Brihat Sâman is meant. For the Rathantaram and Bțihat Sâman are the cohabitation of the gods ; by means of this cohabi tation of the gods one obtains generation ; by means of this cohabitation of the gods generation is produced. (This is done) for production. He who has this knowledge, obtains children and cattle. 

Now they all go and make ablution and proceed to the place of the Agnidhra. That one who knows the invocation offering (dhutz) shall say “hold now one another," then he should bring the offering and recite, "he who produced besides us this ground (our) mother, he, the preserver who feeds (us), may preserve in us wealth, vigour, health, and strength, Svâhâ !" Who knowing this, recites this formula, gains for himself, as well as for the sacrificers, wealth, vigour, health, and strength 

23. (The Chanting and Repeating of the Serpent Mantra. The Chaturhotrai 

Mantra. Its effect. Who Oright to Repeat it.) All the other priests (except the Udgâtris) go from thence (the Agni dhrîya fire) and proceed to the Sadas a place in the south-east of the Utta.

råvedi) all walking each in his own way, in this or that direction. But the Udgâtris walk together. They chant the verses (seen) by the Queen of the Serpents (Sarpa-rajña) ; because the earth (iyam) is the Queen of the Serpents, for she is the queen of all that (359) moves (sarpat). She was in the beginning without hair, as it were (without trees, bushes, &c.) She then saw this mantra, which commences, dyam 

gâuh priśnir akranit (10, 189). In consequence of it, she obtained a motley appearance, she became variegated being able to produce) any form she might like (such as) herbs, trees, and all (other) forms. Therefore the man who has such a knowledge obtains the faculty of assuming any form he might choose. 

The three Udgâtris, Prastotar Udgåtar, and Pratihartar, repeat their respective parts in their mind (i. e. they do not utter words), but the Hotar repeats (aloud) with his voice ; for Vâch (speech) and Manas (mind) are the cohabitation of the gods. By means of this cohabitation of the 

gods, he who has such a knowledge, obtains children and cattle. 

The Hotar now sets forth the Chaturhotri mantras;' he repeats them as the Sastra accompanying the Stotram (the chanting of the verses just mentioned) by the Udgâtsis. The sacrificial name of the deities in the Chaturhotéis was concealed. Therefore the Hotar now sets forth these names, and makes public the appropriate sacrificial name of the deities, and brings what has become public, to the public. He who has this knowledge, becomes public (i.l., celebrated). 

A Brahman who, after having completed his Vedic studies, should not attain to any fame, should go to a forest, string together the stalks of Dharba grass, with their ends standing upwards, and sitting on the right side of another Brahman, repeat with a loud voice, the Chaturhotri mantras. (Should he do so, he would attain to fame). 

([860] When and How the Priests Breaks their Silence on the Tenth Day) 

All touch now the branch of an Udumbara tree (which is at the sacrificial compound behind the seat of the Udgåtar) with their hands, thinking "I touch focd and juice ; ” for the Udumbara tree represents juice" and food. At the time that the gods distributed (for the earth) 

* This is generally done before the singing of a mantra by the Udgåtar; but the Udgåtar not being allowed at this occasion to utter words, his office is taken by the Hobar, 

+ The sap of the Udumbara tree is to be understood. It grew out of the food scattered by the gods on the earth.Say. compare 7, 32. 

245 

food and juice, the Udumbara trees grew up; therefore it brings forth every year three times ripe fruits. If they take the Udumbara branches in their hands, they then take food and juice. They suppress speech, for the sacrifice is' speech; in suppressing the sacrifice (by abstaining from it) they suppress the day; for the day is the heaven-world, and (consequently) they subdue the heaven-world. No speech is allowed during the day; if they would speak during the day, they would hand over the day to the enemy; if they would speak during the night, they would hand over the night to the enemy. Only at the time when the sun bas half set, they should speak; for then they leave but this much space (as is between the conjunction of day and night) to the enemy. Or they should speak (only) after the sun has completely set. By doing so, they make their enemy and adversary share in the darkness. Walking round the Ahavanîya fire, they then speak; for the Abavaniya fire is the sacrifice, and the heaven-world; for by means of the sacrifice, which is the gate of the heaven-world, they go to the heaven-world. By the words, "if we have failed, by omission, or improper application, or by excess, of (861) what is required, all that may go (be taken away) to (our) father, who is Prajapati,” they recommence speaking. For all creatures are born after Prajapati (he being their creator). Prajâpati, therefore, is the shelter from (the evil consequences on what is deficient, or in excess (in his creatures); and thence these two faults do no harm to the sacrificers. Therefore all that is deficient or in excess with them who have this knowledge, enters Prajapati. Thence they should commence speaking by (repeating) this (mantra). 

25. (The Chaturhotri Mantras. The Bodies of Prajapati. The Brahmodyan. The Sacrificers take their Seats in Heaven.) 

When the Hotar is about to repeat the Chaturhotri mantra, he cries, "Adhvaryu!” This is the proper form of ahâva (at this occasion, and not somsávôm). The Adhvaryu then responds, “ Om, Hotar! tatha Hotar!" The Hotar (thereupon) repeats (the Chaturhotri mantras), stopping at each of the ten padas! 

(1) Their sacrificial spoon was intelligence! (2) Their offering was endowed with intellect! (3) Their altar was speech ! (4) Their Barhis (seat) was thought! (5) Their Agni was understanding! 6) Their Agnidhra was reasoning! 

246 

(7) Their offering (havis) was breath! (8) Their Adhvaryu was the Sâman ! (9) Their Hotar was Vâchaspati ! (10) Their Maitrâvaruņa (upa-vakta) was the mind! (11) They (sacrificers) took (with their mind) the Graha! (12) O ruler Vachaspati, O giver, 0 name! (13) Let us put down thy name! (14) May'st thou put down our (names); with (our) [362] names go to 

heaven (announce our arrival in heaven)! (15) What success the gods who have Prajapati for their master, 

gained, the same we shall gain !"$ The Hotar now reads the Prajapati tanu (bodies) mantras, and the 

Brahmodyam. (1 & 2) Eater of food, and mistress of food. The eater of food is 

Agni; the mistress of food is Aditya. (3 & 4) The happy and fortunate. By “ happy" Soma, and by " fortu 

nate" cattle are meant. (5 & 6) The houseless and the dauntless. “Houseless" is Vâyu, who 

never lives in a house, and "fearless" is Death, for all fear him. (7 & 8) The not reached, and not to be reached. "The not reached” is 

Earth, and “the not to be reached” is Heaven. (9 & 10) The unconquerable, and the not to be stopped. “The unconquer 

able" is Agni, and "the not to be stopped" is Âditya (sun). (11 & 12) Who has no first (material) cause (apúrva), nor is liable to 

destruction. “Who has no first (material) cause" is the mind 

(manas) and “what is not liable to destruction " is the year. These twelve bodies of Prajapati make up the whole Prajâpati. On the tenth day, one reaches the whole Prajapati. 

They now repeat the Brahmodyam.' " Agni is (368) the house.father; " thus say some, for he is the master (house-father) of the world (earth). « Vâyu is the house-father, thus say others; for he is the ruler of the airy or region. That one (Aditya, the sun) is the house-father ; for he burns 

8. Heaven-world. The gods ascended to heaven by sacrifice. The same is the object of the sacrificers. This is the Graha mantra, recited by the Hotar. Now follow the Prajapati tanu mantras, and the Brahmodyam. There are twelve Prajapati tanı mantras; they are repeated by pairs, every time two. 

9. That is, what Brahmans ought to repeat. It begins with the words, Agnir grihapatih, and ends with arätsma. This Brahmodyam is no proper mantra, but a kind of Brahmaṇam, or theological exposition. However, the whole is repeated by the Hotar as a mantra. See the whole of it also in the Aśv, Sr. 8. 8, 13, 

** (with his rays). The Ritus are the houses. He who knows what “god is their (the Ritu's) house-father, becomes their house-father, and of succeeds. Such sacrificers are successful (they become masters them "selves). House-father (master) becomes he who knows the god who " destroys the evil consequences of sin (Aditya, the sun). This house * father destroys the evil consequences of sin and becomes (sole) "master. These sacrificers destroy the evil consequences of their sin "(and say), O Adhvaryu ! we have succeeded, we have succeeded."

FIFTH CHAPTER. (The Agnihotram. On the Duties of the Brahma Priest). 

26. (The Agnihotram. When the Sacrificer has to Order his Priest to Bring Fire to the Ahavaniya. The Sixteen Parts of the Agnihotram.) 

The Agnihotri says to his Adhvaryu, " Take from ” (here the Gârha patya fire) the Ahavaniya fire.” Thus he says at evening ; for what good he was doing during the day, all that is taken away (together with [864] the fire and brought) eastwards and put in safety. If he says at morning time, "Take from (here) the Ahavaniya,” then he takes with him all the good he was doing during the night (brings it) eastwards and puts it in safety. The Ahavaniya fire is the sacrifice (sacrificial fire); the Ahavaniya is the heaven-world. He who has this knowledge, places the heaven-world (the real heaven) in the heaven-world, which (is represented by) the sacrifice alone. Who knows the Agnihotram which belongs to all gods, which consists of sixteen parts, and is placed among cattle, is successful by means of it. 

What in it (the offering of which the Agnihotram consists) is of the cow (such as milk) belongs to Rudra. What is joined to the calf, belongs to Vayu. What is being milked, belongs to the Asving. What has been milked, belongs to Soma. What is put on the fire to boil, belongs to Varuņa. What bubbles up (in boiling) belongs to Paşan. What is dripping down, belongs to the Maruts. What has bubbles, belongs to Viśvedevas. The cream (of the milk) gathered, belongs to Mitra. What 

1 The Agnihotram is a burnt offering of fresh milk, brought every day, twice during the whole term of life. Before a Brahman can take upon himself to bring the Agnihotram, he has to establish the three sacred fires, Garhapatya, Dakşina and Ahavaniya. This cere. mony is called Agnyâdhôna. The performers of these daily oblations are called "Agni hotris". They alone are entitled to bring the Istis and Soma sacrifices. There are, up to this day, Agnihotris in the Dekkhan, who way be regarded as the true followers of the ancient Vedic religion,

{alls out of the pot), belongs to Heaven and Earth. What turns up (in boiling), belongs to Savitar. What is seized (and placed in the vessel). belongs to Vişnu. What is placed (on the Vedi) belongs to Brihaspati. The first offering is Agni's, the latter portion is Prajapati's, the offering itself (chief portion) belongs to Indra. This is the Agnihotram, belonging to all gods, which comprises sixteen parts. 

27. (How the priest has to make good certain casualties which may happen when the Agnihotram is offered.) 

If the cow of an Agnihotri - which is joined to her calf, sits down during the time of being milked, what is the penance for it ? He shall repeat over it this (365) mantra. “Why dost thou sit down out of fear? From this grant us safety! Protect all our cattle! Praise to Rudra the giver!” (By repeating the following mantra) he should raise her up." The divine Aditi (cow) rose, and put long life in the sacrifice, she who provides Indra, Mitra and Varuņa with their (respective) shares (in the sacrifice)." Or he may hold on her udder and mouth a vessel filled with water and give her (the cow) then to a Brahman, 

This is another Prayaschitta (penance). 

If the cow of an Agnihotri, which is joined to her calf, cries during the time of being milked, how is this to be atoned for? If she cries out of hunger, to indicate to the sacrificer what she is in need of, then he shall give her more food in order to appease her. For food is appeasing. The mantra súyavasad bhagavatt (1, 164, 40) is to be repeated. This is the Prayaschitta. 

If the cow of an Agnihotri which is joined to her calf moves during the time of being milked, what is the Prayaschitta ? Should she in mov ing spill (some milk) then he shall stroke her, and whisper (the following words), “ What of the milk might have fallen to the ground to-day, what "might have gone to the herbs, what to the waters ---may this milk be in ' my houses, (my) cow, (my) calves, and in me." He shall then bring a burnt offering with what has remained, if it be sufficient for making the burnt offering (Homa). 

Should all in the vessel have been spilt (by the moving of the cow) then he shall call another cow, milk her and bring the burnt offering with that milk, and sacrifice it. It is to be offered alone in faith.s 

? The cow herself is called Agnihotri. 

> The meaning of the sentence : Meda gre graad is: this (substitute) is to be offered (completely) even including the sraddha. This is the formula : XT TETA (i.e.) " Iofor (this) in faith (as a believing ono)." 

249 

[366] This is the Prâyaschitta. He who with such a knowledge offers the Agnihotram, has (only) offerings in readiness (which are fit) and has (consequently) all (accepted by the gods). 

28. (On the Meaning of the Agnihotram, if Performed in Perfect Faith. It 

represents Dakşiņâ. The Aśvina Sastra, Mahavrata, and Agnicha yana are hinted at in it.) 

That Aditya (the sun) is his (the Agnihotri's) sacrificial post, the earth is his altar, the herbs are his Barbis (seat of grass), the trees are his fuel, the waters his sprinkling vessels, the directions the wooden sticks laid round about (the hearth). If anything belonging to the Agnihotri should be destoryed, or if he should die, or if he should be deprived of it, then he should receive all this in the other world, placed, as it were, on the Barbis (sacrificial litter). And the man who, having this know ledge, performs the Agnihotram, will actually obtain (all this). 

He brings as Dakşiņa (donation) both gods and men mutually, and everything (the whole world). By his evening offering he presents men to the gods, and the whole world. For men, if being fast asleep without shelter, as lt were, are offered as gifts to the gods. By the morning offering he presents the gods as gifts to men, and the whole world. The gods, after having understood the intention (of men that the gods should serve them) make efforts (to do it), saying “ I will do it, I will go." What world a man, who has presented all this property to the gods, might gain, the same world gains he who, with this kaowledge, performs the Agnihotram. 

By offering the evening oblation to Agni, the Agnihotri commences the Asvina Sastra (which [367] commences with a verse addressed to *Agai). By using the term vâch, 2. e., speech (when taking out the Agnihotram) he makes a (pratigara), i. e., response (just as is done at the repetition of a Sastra). 

By (thus) repeating every day “ Vâch," the Asvina Sastra " is recited by Agni at night, for him who, having this knowledge, brings the Agni. hotram. 

* The Asvina sastra is required at the commencement of the Gavám ayanam, when making Atirätra. See 4, 17-11. The author of our Brâhmana here tries to find out some resemblance between the performance of the evening Agnihotram and the Asvina sas tra. He finds it in the circumstance, that this offering belongs to Agni, and the Aspina Sastra commences with a verse addressed to Agai (4,7). Having thus obtained the commencement of the sastra, he must find out also the pratigara or response which belongs to every Sastra. This ho discovers in the formula : vache tua notre, which the Agnihotri repeats as often as the offering is taken out for being sacrificed, 

250 

By offering the morning oblation to Âditya, he commences the Maha vrata o ceremony. By using (a term equivalent to) prâna, i. e., life (when eating the remainder of the Agnihotram) he makes a pratigara (also). By (thus) repeating every day the word "food " (life), the Mahâvrata (Sas tram) is recited by Aditya at day for him who, with this knowledge, per forms the Agnihotram. 

The Agnihotrî has to perform during the year 720 evening offerings and also 720 morning offerings, just as many bricks (1440) marked by sacrificial formulas as are required at the Gavam ayanam. He who with such a knowledge brings the Agnihotram, has the sacrifice performed with a Sattra (868] lasting all the year (and) with Agni Chitya (the hearth constructed at the Chayana ceremony). 

29, (Whether the Morning Oblation of the Agnihotrê is to be offered Before ore 

After Sunrise. Vrişaśuşma, the son of Vatavata, the son of Jâtukarna, said, “We shall tell this to the gods, that they perform now the Agnihotram, which was brought on both days (on the evening of the preceding, and the morning of the following, day) only every other day." And a girl, who was possessed by a Gandharva, spoke thus, " We shall tell it to the Pitaras (ancestors), that the Agnihotram which was performed on both days, is now performed every other day." 

The 'Agnihotram performed every other day is performed at evening after sunset, and at morning before sunrise. The Agnihotram performed · on both days is performed at evening after sunset, and at morning after sunrise. Therefore, the Agnihotram is to be offered after sunrise. For · he who offers the Agnihotram before sunset, reaches in the twenty fourth year the Gayatri world, but if he brings it after sunrise, in the 

This concludes the Gavam ayanan See the note to 4, 12, The resemblance between the Mahávrata and the morning Agnistoma is found by our author in the following points : The morning Agnihotram belongs to Âditya, and the Niękevalya Sastra of the Mahâ vrata commences with a mantra addressed to the same deity. The Pratigara he finds in the mantra, annam payo reto smásu, which the Agnihotri repeats as often as he eats the remainder of his offering. 

• At each Atirá tra of the Gavâm ayanam, the so-called Ohayana ceremony takes place. This consists in the construction of the Uttara Vedi (the northern altar) in the shape of an eagle. About 1440 bricks are required for this structure, each being conse orated with a separate Yajus mantra. This altar represents the universe. A tortoise is buried alive in it, and a living frog carried round it and afterwards turned out. The fire kindled on this new altar is the Agni Chitya. To him are the oblations of flesh and Soma to be given. · The whole ceremony is performed by the Adhvaryu alono. 

251 twelfth. When he brings the Agnihotram before sunrise during two years, then he has actually sacrificed during one year only. But if he sacrifices after sunrise, then he completes the yearly amount of offerings in one year. Therefore (869) the Agnihotram is to be brought after sunrise. He who sacrifices after sunget at evening, and after sun rise in the morning, brings the offering in the lustre of the day-night (Ahorâtra). For the night receives light from Agni, and the day from the sun (Aditya). By means of this light the day is illuminated. Therefore he who sacrifices after sunrise, performs the sacrifice only in the light of Ahorâtra (that is, he receives the light only once, instead of twice, the offering brought before sunrise belonging to the night, and being illumi -pated by Agni, not by Aditya). 

30. (Several Stanzas Quoted Regarding the Necessity to bring the Agnihotram 

After Sunrise). 

• Day and night are the two wheels of the year. By means of both, he passes the year. He who sacrifices before sunrise, goes by one wheel, as it were, only. But he who sacrifices after suprise, is going through the year with both wheels, as it were, and reaches his destination soon. There is a sacrificial Gâthâ (stanza) which runs as follows: 

“All that was, and will be, is connected with the two Sâmans, Brihat and Rathantaram, and subsists through them. The wise man, after baping 

established the sacred hearths (the Agnihotri), shall bring a different * sacrifice at day, and a different one at night (i. e., devoted to different "deities)." 

The night belongs to the Rathantaram, the day to the Brihat. · Agni is the Rathantaram, Aditya the Brihat. Both these deities cause him to go to the heaven-world, to the place of splendour (bradhna), who with this knowledge sacrifices (the Agnihotram) after sunrise. Thence it is to be sacrificed after sunrise. Regarding this, there is a sacrificial Gâthe chanted, which runs as follows: 

“Just as a man who drives with one pack-horse (870) only without " purchasing another one, act all those men who bring the Agnihotram "" before sunrise." . For all beings whatever follow this deity (Aditya) when he stretches (the arms at sunrise and sunset). He who has this knowledge, is followed by this deity, after whom all follows, and he follows her, For this Aditya252 

is the "one guest" who lives among those who bring the sacrifice after sunrise. Concerning this there is a Gatha (stanza, which runs as fol. lows); 

“He who has stolen lotus fibres, and does not receive (even) one guest k on the evening, will charge with this guilt the not guilty, and take off the * guilt from the guilty." 

This Aditya is the "one guest" (ekätithih) he is it"who lives among the sacrificers.” The man who (371] thinking, it is enough of the Agnihotram, does not sacrifice, to this deity (Aditya), shuts him out from being his guest. Therefore this deity, if shut out, shuts such an Agnihotri out from both this world and that one. 

Therefore he who thinks, it is enough of the Agnihotram, may nevertheless bring sacrifices. Thence they say, a guest who comes at evening is not to be sent away. It happened that once a learned man, Janaśruteya, a resident of a town (a Nagari), said to an Aikadaśakşa, a descendant of Marutantu, "We recognise from the children, whether one brings the Agnihotram with or without the proper knowledge." Aikâda Hâkşa had as many children as are required to fill a kingdom. Just 28 many children will he obtain who brings the Agnihotram after sunrise.

31. (The Agnihotram is to be offered After Sunrise). In rising, the sun joins his rays to the Abavaniya fire. Who, therefore, sacrifices before sunrise, is like a female giving her breast to an unborn 

'Sayaņa makes the following remarks on this rather obscure stanza : 

पुरा कदाचित्सप्तर्षीणां संवादप्रसंगे कश्चित्पुरुषो बिसस्तैन्य लक्षणमपवादं प्राप्य तत्परिहारार्थमृषी सामने शपथं चकार । तदीयशपथोक्तिरूपेयं गाथा बिसानि पद्ममूलानि तेषामपहर्ता प्रत्यवायपरंपरा प्राप्नोतु ॥ पापरहिते पुरुष बिसविषयमपवादं कृतवतो यः प्रत्यवायः पापिनः पुरुषस्य संबंधी पापं स्वीकुर्वतो यः प्रत्यवायः सायंकाले गृहे समागच्छत एवातिथेवैदेशिकस्यापरोधने यः प्रत्यवायः सेयं प्रत्यवायपरंपरा बिसस्तैन्ये सति मम भूयादित्येवं शपधः । अक्षरार्थस्तु अप्रसिद्धो माशः पुरुष स्तेनश्चोरो भूत्वा बिसान्यपजहार चेत् स पुमान् भनेनस पापरहितं पुरुषं श्रोत्रियं एनसा प्रोमिश 

सार पापेनाभिशंसनमपवादं कुर्यात् । तथेष स बिसापहारसायंकाले गृहे समागतं एकातिथिमपरुणद्धि भोजनमदत्वा निःसारयेत् ॥ 

The stealing of bisäni, i.e., lotus obres, from tank appears to have been a great offence in ancient times. Not to receive one guest (at least) on the evening was consi dered as equally wicked. The man who has committed such crimes will, in order to clear himself from all guilt, charge an innocent man with it. The forms abhišaståt and apaharat have evidently the sense of a future tense, as is the case in other instances also. The stanza in question appears to be very old, and was hardly intelligible even to the author of oar Brdhmaṇam. He means by ekátithiḥ "the one guest," the sun, which, according to the context, cannot bave been the original genser.

child, or a cow giving her udder to an unborn calf. But he who sacrifices after sunrise is like a female giving her breast to a child which is born, or like a cow giving her udder to a calf which is born. The Agnihotram being thus offered to him (Sürya), he (Sûrya) gives to the Agnihotri in return, food in both worlds, in this one and that one. He who brings the Agnihotram before sunrise, is like such an one who throws food before a man or an elephant, who do not stretch forth their hands foot caring for it). But he who sacrifices after sunrise, is like such an one who throws food before a man or an elephant who stretch forth their hands. He who has this knowledge, and sacrifices after sunrise, lifts up with this hand (Aditya's hand) his sacrifice, and puts it down [872] in the heaven-world. Therefore the sacrifice is to be brought after sunrise. 

When rising, the sun brings all beings into motion (pranayati). Therefore be is called prána (breath). The offerings of him who, knowing this, sacrifices after sunrise, are well stored up in this prâna (Aditya). Therefore it is to be sacrificed after sunrise. 

That man is speaking the truth, who in the evening after sunset, and in the morning after sunrise, brings his offering. He commences the evening sacrifice by the words, " Bhur, Bhuvah, Svar, Om! Agni is Light, Light is Agni;" and the morning sacrifice by “Bhúr, Bhuvah, Svar, Om! Sun is Light, Light is Şun." The truth-speaking man offers thus in truth, when he brings his sacrifice after sunrise. Therefore it must be sacrificed after sunrise. This is well expressed in a sacrificial stanza which is chanted. 

“Those who sacrifice before sunrise tell every morning an “ untruth; for, if celebrating the Agnihotram at night which ought to be * celebrated at day, they say, Sun is Light, but then they have no light 

" (for the sun has not risen)." 

82. (On the Creation of the World. The Origin of the Vedas and the Sacred 

Words. The Penances for Mistakes committed at a Sacrifice.) Prajapati had the desire of creating beings and multiplying himself. He underwent (consequently) austerities. Having finished them, he created these worlds, viz., earth, air and heaven. He heated them(with the lustre of his mind, pursuing a course of austerities); three lights were produced: Agni from the earth, Vậyu from the air, and Aditya from heaven. He heated them again, in consequence of which the three Vedas were produced. The Rigveda came from Agni, the Yayurveda from 

254 

Täyu, and the Såmaveda from Aditya. Ho heated these Vedas, [8781 in consequence of which three luminaries arose, viz., Bhûr came from the Rigveda, Bhuvah from the Yajurveda, and Svar from the Sâmaveda. He heated these luminaries again, and three sounds came out of them â, u and m. By putting them together, he made the syllable om. There fore he (the priest) repeats "Om! Om!," for Om is the heaven-world, and Om is that one who burns (Aditya). 

Prajapati spread the sacrifice (extending it), took it, and sacrificed with it. By means of the Rich (Rigveda), he performed the duties of the Hotar; by means of the Yajus, those of the Adhvaryu; and by means of the Saman, those of the Udgåtar. Out of the splendour (seed) which is inherent in this three-fold knowledge (the three Vedas), he made the Brahma essence. 

Prajapati offered then the sacrifice to the gods. The gods spread it, took it, and sacrificed with it, and did just as Prajapati had done (regarding the office of the Hotar, &c). The gods said to Prajâpati, “If a mistake has been committed in the Rik, or in the Yajus, or in the Saman in our sacrifice, or in consequence of ignorance, or of a general misfortune, what is the atonement for it?" Prajâpati answered, " When you commit a mistake in the Rik, you shall sacrifice in the Gárha patya, saying Bhuh. When you commit one in the Yajus, then you shall sacrifice in the Agnidhriya fire or (in the absence of it, as is the case) in the Havis offerings, 10 in the cooking fire (Dakşiņa Agni) saying, Bhuvah. When a mistake is committed in the Saman, then it is to be sacrificed in the Abavanîya fire by saying, Svar. When a mistake has been committed out of ignorance, or in consequence of a general [374] mishap, then you shall sacrifice in the Ahavaniya fire, reciting all three words, Bhůh, Bhuvah, Svar. These three " great words” (vyâhriti) are like nooses to tie together the Vedas. It is just like joining one thing to another, one link to another link, like the stringing of anything made of leather, or of any other thing, and connecting that which was disconnected, that one puts together by means of these great words all that was isolated in the sacrifice. These Vyabrītis are the general Prâyaschitta (penance); thence the penances (for mistakes ) at a sacrifice are to be made with them.

and mind. Dy there are both the three 

(On the Office of the Brahma Priest. He ought to remain Silent during all 

the Principal Ceremonies.) The great sages (mahavadah) ask, "When the duties of a Hotar are performed by the Rik, those of the Adhvaryus by the Yajus, and those of the Udgâtar by the Saman, and the three-fold science is thus properly carried into effect by the several (priests employed), by what means then are the duties of the Brahmâ priest performed ?" To this one should answer, “This is done just by means of this three-fold science." 

He who blows (Vậyu) is the sacrifice. He has two roads, viz., speech and mind. By their means (speech and mind), the sacrifice is performed. In the sacrifice there are both, speech and mind, required. By means of speech the three priests of the three-fold science perform one part (assigned to Vach); but the Brahmâ priest performs his duty by the mind only. Some Brahmâ priests, after having muttered the Stomabhâ gas 11 when all arrangements have been made for [875] the repetition of the Prâtaranuváka (the morning prayer) sit down, and speak (without performing any of the ceremonies). 

Respecting this (the silence on the part of the Brahmâ priests); a Brah man;who saw a Brahmâ priest at the Prâtaranuvâka talk, said (once) "they (the priests and the sacrificer) have made one-half of this sacrifice to disappear." Just as a man who walks with one foot only, or a carriage which has one wheel only, falls to the ground, in the same manner the sacrifice falls to the ground (bhreşan nyeti), and if the sacrifice has fallen, the sacrificer falls after it too (if the Brahmâ priests talk during the time they ought to be silent). Therefore the Brahmâ priest should; after the order for repeating the Prâ taranuvâka has been given, refrain from speaking till the oblations from the Upâmáu and Antaryâma (Grahas) are over. After the order for chanting the Pavamâna Stotra has been given (he ought also to refrain from speaking) till the last verse (of the Stotra) is done. And [376] again, he should during, the chanting of the (other) Stotras, and the repeating of the Sastras, refrain from speaking, till the Vaşatkâra (at the end of the Yâjyâ verse of the Sastra) is pronounced. Likewise, as a man walking on both his legs, 

11 The Stomabhägas are certain Yajus-like mantras which are to be found in tho Brahmanas of the Samaveda only (not in the Yajus or Rigveda). Each of these mantras consists of four parts: (a) To what the Stoma is like, such as a cord, a joint, &c.; (b) To what it is devoted or joined; (c) An order to the Stoma to favour the object to

and a carriage going on both its wheels, does not suffer any injury, in the same way such a sacrifice (if performed in this manner), does not suffer any injury, nor the sacrificer either, if the sacrifice be not injured. 

34. (On the Work done by the Brahma. He Permits the Chanters to Chant) 

They say, When the sacrificer has the reward (dakşına) given to the Adhvaryu, he thinks,“ this priest has seized with his hands my Grahas (Soma cups), he has walked for me, he has sacrificed for me." And when he has the reward given to the Udgâtar, he thinks, "he has sung for me ; " and when he has the reward given to the Hotar, he thinks, " this priest has spoken for me the Anuvâkyâs, and the Yâjyâs, and repeated the Sastras." But on account of what work done is the Brahmâ priest to receive his reward ? Shall he receive 12 the reward, thinks the sacrificer, without having done any work whatever ? Yes, he receives it for his medi cal attendance upon the sacrifice, for the Brahmâ is the physician of the sacrifice (which is regarded as a man). Because of the Brahmâ priest performing his priestly function with the Brahma, which is the quintessa ence of the metres. He does one-half of the work, for he was at the head of the other priests, and the others (Adhvaryu, Hotar, Udgatar) do the other half. (The Brahmâ priests tell if any mistake has been commit. [877] ted in the sacrifice, and perform the Prâyaschittas, as described above.)13 which it is joined; (d) An order to the chanters to chant the Stoma by the permission of Savitar in honour of Brihaspati. The last (fourth) part is in all the stomabhagya mantras the same, I give here some of these mantras, which are all to be found in the Tândya Brahmanam (1, 8-9). They commence : 

1 (a) ffhTMA () para car (c) qui para (d) fanga acetad 2 (a) sfarra (6) car (c) forza (d) 3 (a) palarie (6) feat ceny (cfara fora (d) 4 (a) abah (b) Arafata (c) graft fra d 5 (a) faevatske (6) cea ca (c) a do. The proper meaning of the repetition of these and similar mantras by the Brahmå prieste is, to bring the chant (8toma), which is about to be performed, into contact with the external world, with day, night, air, rains the gods, and secure the favour of all these powers and beings. 

12 In the original, narata, which is to be taken in the sense of a future. 

** I have not translated the passage regarding the Prayaschitta to be performed by the Brahma priest if any mistake has been committed ; for it is only a repetition from 5, 92, 

The Prastotar13 says, after the order for chanting the Stotram has been given, "O Brahmâ, we shall now chant, our commander ! " The Brahmâ then shall say at the morning libation, "Bhûr ! filled with the thought of Indra, ye may sing !" and at the evening libation, [878] he says, "Svar! filled with the thought of Indra, ye may sing." 

At the time of the Ukthya or Atirâtra sacrifice, all the three great words, Bhûr Bhuvaḥ Svar are required. If the Brahmâ says, “Filled with the thought of Indra, ye may sing," this means, that the sacrifice is Indra's, for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice. By the words, "filled with the thought of Indra," the Brahmå priest connects the Udgitha (the principal part of the chant) with Indra. This saying of the Brahmâ means, "Do not leave Indra; filled with him, ye may sing." Thus he tells them. 

HRONO 

14 The announcement of the Prastotar, that the chanters are ready to perform their chant, as well as the orders to do so given by the Brahma and Maitråvaruņa, are contained in fall in the Ašval, dr. S. (5,2), and in the Sank, Sr. 8, (6,8). I here give the text from the Aśv. S. : ब्रह्मन् स्तोष्यामः प्रशास्तरिति स्तोत्रायातिसर्जितावतिसृजतो भूरिन्द्रवन्तः सवितृप्रसूता इति जपित्वा स्तुध्वमिति ब्रह्मा प्रातःसवने भुव इति माध्यन्दिने स्वरिति तृतीयसवने भूभवः स्वरिन्द्रवन्तः सवितृप्र. सूता इत्यूर्वमानिमारुतात् । स्तुतदेवेन सवित्रा प्रसूता ऋतं च सत्यं च बदत । आयुष्मत्य ऋचो मा गात तनू पात्साम्न श्रो३मिति जपिल्वा मैत्रावरुणः स्तुध्वमित्युच्चैः॥ (When the Prastotar calls) “ Brahmâ, we shall chant, О commander !" then the two priests (the Brahma and Maitråvarupa) whose daty it is to allow (the chanters to sing) give their permission. The Brahmâ, after having first mattered the words *bhûr, be ye filled with Indra, created by Savitar (or permitted by Savitar)," at the morning libation, says, "chant;" at the midday libation he uses, instead of bhür, bhuvah ; and at the evening libation, svar (the remainder of the Japa being the same). Before all the Stotras which follow the Agnimăruta sastra (which concludes the Sastras of the Agnistoma), that is to say, at the Ukthya, Solasî, Atirâtra sacrifices, &c., the Brahmâ mutters all the three great words (bhir, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ along with the remainder of the formula) at the same time. The Maiträvaruņa, after having mattered, “ Speak what is right and true, ye who are created by Savitar, the god to whose honour praises are chanted, do not lose the sacred verses (chanted by you) which are life, may he protect both bodies of the Saman (the verses and the tune) Om !" says aloud" chant!"

### 01
FIRST CHAPTER. (On the Offices of the Grävastut and Subrahmanya.) 

(On the Origin of the Office of the Gråvastut. The Serpent 

Rişi Arbuda.) The gods held (once upon a time) a sacrificial session in Sarvacbaru. They did not succeed in [880] destroying the consequences of guilt. Arbuda, the son of Kadru, the Serpent Rişi, the framer of mantras, said to them, “You have overlooked one ceremony which is to be performed by the Hotar. I will perform it for you, then you will destroy the consequences of guilt." They said, “Well, let it be done." At every midday libation, he then came forth (from his hole), approached them, and repeated spells over the Soma, squeezing stones. Thence they repeat spells at every midday libation over the Soma squeezing stones, in imitation of him (the Serpent Rişi). The way on which this Serpent Rişi used to go when coming from his holo) is now known by the name Arbudoda Sarpant (at the sacrificial compound). 

1 See also him about Asv, Sr. 8.5, 12. His services are only required at the midday libation. He performs his function of repeating mantras over the Soma, squeezing stones before the so-called Dadhi Gharma ceremony. He enters through the eastern gate, and passes on to the two Havirdhanas (the two carts, on which the sacrificial offerings are put, and the two covered places, in which these two carts are). Having arrived north-east of the exterior front of the axe (akşaśiras) of the southern Havirdhana, he throws off a stalk of grass held in his hand, which ceremony is called nirasanam (it is performed often by other priests also). He then faces the Soma shoots, assuming a peculiar posture. The Adhvaryu gives him a band (uşmişa), which he ties round his face. As soon as the Adhyaryu and his assistants take the Soma sprouts from below, the adhisavana board (see the note to 7, 32), he ought to repeat the mantras over the Gravanas, which are now being employed for extracting the Soma jaice. He commences with verses containing the term su, to squeeze, or derivatives of it. The first is: abhi två deva savitar (1, 24, 3). After some more single Terses follow, the three principal Grå våņa hymns, viz., pruite vadantu (10, 94), á va rimjase (10,76), and pra vo grävánah (10, 175). The first and the last are said to have been seen by Arbuda, the Serpent Rişi, the second by Jarat karna, one of the Serpent tribe also. These hymns very likely formed part of the so-called Sarpaveda or Serpent Veda (see the Gopatha Brahmapam 1, 10, according to whose statement this Veda came from the east), and were originally foreign to the Rigveda. They may be, nevertheless, very ancient. The two lattor hymns are to be repeated before the last verse of the first, and are thus treated like a Nivid at the evaning libation. Either in the midst, or before, or, after these two hymns, the Grå vastut must repeat the 

The King (Soma) made the gods drunk. They then said, “A poison ous serpent (asivişa) looks at our King! Well, let us tie a band round his eyes." They then tied a band round his eyes. Therefore they recito the spells over the Soma squeezing stones, when having tied (round the eyes) a band in imitation of what the gods did). The King (Soma) made them drunk. They said, “He (the Serpent Rişi) repeats his own mantra over the Soma squeezing stones. Well, let us mix with his mantra other verses." They then mixed with his mantra other verses, in consequence of which he (Soma) did not make them drunk.: By mixing his mantra with other verses for effecting propitiation, they succeeded in destroying the consequences of guilt. [381] In imitation of this feat achieved by the gods, the Serpents destroyed all consequences of their own guilt. Having in this state (being quite free from guilt and sin) left off the old skin torn, they obtain a new one. Who knows this, destroys the consequences of his own guilt.

(How Many Verses are to be Repeated over the Grdvanas. How they ought to be Repeated. They are Required only at the Midday Libation. No Order for Repeating them Necessary.) 

They say, With how many mantras should he (the Gråvastut) pray over the Soma squeezing stones? The answer is, with a hundred; for the life of a man is a hundred years, he has a hundred powers, and a hundred bodily organs; by doing so, he makes man participate in age, strength, and bodily organs. (Others) say, He ought to repeat thirty-three verses, for he (the Serpent Rishi) destroyed the sins of thirty-three gods, for there are thirty-three gods. (Others) say, He ought to recite an unlimited number of such mantras. For Prajâpati is unlimited; and this recital of the mantras referring to the Soma squeezing stones belongs to Prajapati, and in it all desires are comprised. Who does so, obtains all he desires. Thence he ought to repeat an unlimited number of such mantras. 

Now they ask, In what way should he repeat these mantras (over the Soma squeezing stones) ? Syllable by syllable, or should he take four syllables together, or pâda by pâda, or half verse by half verse, or 80-called Påvamåní verses (Rigveda 9.) He has to continue his recitation as long as the squeezing of the juice lasts, or he may go on till it is filled in the Grahas få vd graha grahanåt); he then must conclude with the last verse of the first Gråvåna hymn. Besides this ritual for the Grâvastut, another one is given by Aspaldyana, which he traces to Gå nagâri. 

These mantras were the antidote, 

260 

verse by verse? With whole verses (repeated without stopping) one does not perform any ceremony, nor with stopping at every pâda. If the verses are repeated with stopping at every syllable, or every four syllables, then the metres become mutilated, for [382] many syllables (sounds) would thus be lost. Thence he ought to (repeat) these mantras one half verse by another. For man has two legs, and cattle are four-footed: By doing so, he places the two-legged sacrificer among the four-legged cattle. Thence he ought to repeat these mantras by half verses. 

Since the Grâvastut repeats only at every midday libation mantras over the Soma squeezing stones, how do mantras become repeated over them at the two other (morning and evening) libations ? By repeating verses in the Gayatri metre, he provides for the morning libation; for the Gâyatri metre is appropriate to the morning libation; and by repeat ing verses in the Jagati metre, he provides for the evening libation ; for the Jagatî metre is appropriate to the evening libation. In this way he who, with this knowledge, repeats the mantras over the Soma squeezing stones only at the midday libation, supplies these praises for the morning and eveving libations. 

They say, What is the reason, that, whilst the Adhvaryu calls upon the other priests to do their respective duties, the Grâvastut repeats this mantra without being called upon (without receiving a prâişa)? The ceremony of repeating mantras over the Soma squeezing stones is of the same nature as the mind which is not called upon. Therefore the Grâvastut repeats his mantra without being called upon.

(The Subrahmanya Fomula. On its Nature. By whom it is to be Repeated. The Oblation from the Pâtnivata Graha. The Yâjyâ of the Agnidhra.) 

The Subrahmanya is Vâch. Her son is the [383] king Soma. At the time of buying Soma, they call the Subrahmanyâ (thither), just as one calls a cow. 

z The Subrahmanya formula is contained in the Katyåyána srauta Satras (1, 3), the Apnistoma Sima Prayoga, the Satapatha Brahm. (3, 3, 4, 17-20), and the Taittirîya Aranyaka (1, 12, 3-4). The peculiar pronunciation of this formula is noted by Paşini (1,2, 37-38). The most complete information on its use being only to be found in the gamaveda satras, I here give the passages from Katyayana referring to it, along with the formalà itself: 

श्रातिथ्यायों सेस्थितायां दक्षिणस्य द्वारबाहोः पुरस्तात्तिष्ठन्नन्तवदिदेशेऽन्वारब्धे यजमाने पल्ल्यांचं सुब्रह्मण्योमिति निरुक्त्वा निगदं ब्रूयात् । इन्द्रागच्छ हरिव आगच्छ मेधातिथेमेष वृषणध्वस्य मेने गौरावस्कन्दिबहल्यायै जार कौशिक ब्राह्मण गौतम अवातावदहे स्तुल्यामिति याचदहे स्यात् । 

261 

(884) Through this son, the Subrahmanyâ priest milks' (obtains) all desires for the sacrificer. For Vâch grants all desires of him who has this knowledge. They ask, What is the nature of this Subrahmaṇya ? 

After the Atithya Isti has been finished, he (the Subrahmanya) shonld stand in the front part of the enclosure made for the wife of the sacrificer inside the Vedi, and when touching the sacrificer and his wife, after having called thrice " subrahmanyom,*recite the following formula, “ Oome, Indra! come owner of the yellow horses ! ram of Me 

dhatithi ! Menâ of Vrisagašval thou buffalo (gaura) who ascendest the female ** (avaskardin), lover of Abalya! son of Kubika ! Brahmana ! son of Gotama ! (come) & thou who art called " (to appear) at the Soma feast in so and so many days how many there might intervene (between the day on which the Subrahmanya calls him, and that of the Soma festival at which his presence is requested). The Subrah, manya is required on the second, third, fourth and fifth day of the Agnistoma, and almost on every day of the other Soma sacrifices. On the second day, the terms, trua ke sutyám, " three days hence," i.e., on the fifth); on the third day, duyane sutyam. i.e. two days konce; on the fourth, svas, i. e., to-morrow; and on the fifth (the day of the soma feast) adya, i. e, to-day, are used to mark the time when the Soma banquet, to which Indra is by this formula solemnly invited, is to come off. As far as satur which is followed by the mentioning of the time appointed me, z , &c., there is no difference anywhere observable. But the few sentences which follow, and which conclude the formula, differ according to: different schools. Some were (according to Katyayana) of opinion, that only tres * come hithet " is to follow; others recommended TTUSO 

9991." come hither, O Maghavan." Others, such as Gautama, were of opinion, that either is to be omitted, and the concluding formula, a SETU T ETITA rega si come, ye divine Brahmá priests, come, come." has to follow immediately upon rat, 

The name of the tune (Saman), according to which it is chanted (or rather recited) is Brahmasri, the metre is called Sampát, the Rişi is Aditya, and Indra is the deity. 

At the so-called Agnishtut sacrifices, which open the Chaturdasarätra Sattras (sacrifi cial sessions lasting for a fortnight), (Ašv. Sr. 8, 11, 2), the Subrahmanya calls Agni instead of Indra (Kâtydy. 1, 4), according to Gautama, by the following formula : 

अन प्रागच्छ रोहिताभ्यां बहदु माना धूमकेतो जातवेदो विचर्षण आंगिरस ब्राह्मणांगिरस ब्रवाण। że, « Come, O Agni, with (thy) two red ones (horses), thou brightly shining, thou blaz ing in smoke, Jätavedås, thou wise . Angiras. Brahmana, (come) called, " &c, In the concluding formula at may ires, is used instead of Car According to Dhânaõjay the Subrahmanyâ formula for Agni runs as follows: * *g Fara 1145 

\#TETSTFITS : FEIT artrat 

area, (the remainder as above), i. e., & Come, Agnil master of the red horses, goat of Bhardvāja, son of power, thou who ascendest (the female); lover of Usas," &c. The latter formula is just like that one addrossed to Indra. Ágni, as well as Indra, are in both these formālas, which must be very ancient, invoked as family deities, the first pre-eminently worshipped by the Angirasa, the latter by the Kušikas. Both gods are here called s Brâhmans." In later books, Indra appears as a Kşattriya, and as a model of a king. 

On the so-called Agnistomiya day, of all sacrifices (in the Agnistoma, it is the fourth and precedes the Soma day), on which day the animal for Ågni and Soma is slain and sacrificed, an extension of the Subrahmanyâ formula takes place. The Subrahmanyâ priest has on this day to announce to the gods, that such and such one (the name of the sacrificer must be mentioned), the son of such and such one, the grandson of such and such one, offers, as a Diksita, (as initiated into the sacrifi cial rites) a sacrifice (rar 780) The term, "Diksita, forms then henceforth part of the name of the sacrificer, and his descendants down to the seventh degree. In this part of India, there are many Brahmans distinguished by this honorary epithet, which always indicates that, either the bearer of it or his immediate ancestors have performed a Soma sacrifice, and have been proclaimed dikşita by the Subrahmanya in all due form, 

3 Duhe must be a 3rd person singulur, as Sáy, explains it.262 

1885) One should answer, She is Vach. For Vâch is Brahma, and Sub rahma (good Brahma). 

They ask, Why does one call him (the Subrahmanyâ priest) who is a male, a female ? (They answer) Subrahmanyâ represents Vâch (which is in the feminine gender). 

They further ask, When all the other priests are to perform their respective duties within the Vedi, and the Subrahmanya outside the Vedi, how is it that the duty of the Subrahmanyà (in this particular case) becomes performed inside the Vedi) ? One should answer, The Vedi has an outlet where things (which are no more required) are thrown; if the Subrahmanyâ priest calls (the Subrahmanya) when stand ing in this outlet, then, in this way (his duty is performed within the bounds of the Vedi). They ask, Why does he, standing in the outlet repeat the Subrahmanya ? On this, they tell the following story.) 

The Risis held once a sacrificial session. They said to the most aged man among them,“ Call the Subrahmanya. Thou shalt call the gods standing among us (on account of thy age), as it were, nearest to them." In consequence of this, the gods make him (the Subrahmanya) very aged. In this way, he pleases the whole Vedi. 

They ask, Why do they present to him (the Subrahmanya) a bull as a reward for his services ? (The answer is) The bull is a male (vriga), the Subrahmanyâ is a female, both making thus a couple. This is done for producing offspring from this pair. 

The Agnidhra repeats the Yâjyä mantra for the Pâtnivata Gralia (a Soma vessel), with a low voice. For the Pâtnivata is the semen virile, and the effusion of the semen virile passing on without noise, as it were, he does not make the Anuvaşatkára. For (886) the Anuvasatkâra is a stop. Thinking, I will not stop the effusion of the semen, he does not make the Anuvaşatkâra, for the semen which is not disturbed in its effusion, bears fruit. Sitting near the Nestar, he then eats, for the Nestar is in the room of women. Agni (Agnidhra) pours semen in wo men, to produce children. He who has this knowledge, provides through Agni his females with semen, and is blessed with children and cattle. 

The Subrahmanyâ ends after the distribution of the Dakşiņa, for she is Vâch. The Dakşiņå is food ; thus they place finally the sacrifice in food, which is Speech. 

* He represents Agni. * The Dakshina is distributed at the midday libation.

SECOND CHAPTER. On the Sustras of the Minor Hotri-priests at the Sattras.) 

(On the Sastras of Minor Hotri-priests at the Morning and 

Evening Libations.) The Devas spread the sacrifice. When doing so, the Asuras approach ed them, thinking, let us obstruct their sacrifice. They attacked them from the right side, thinking this to be the weak point. The Devas awoke, and posted two of their number, Mitra and Varuņa, on the right side. Through the assistance of these two, the Devas drove the Asuras and Rakşasas away from the morning libation. And thus the sacrificers drive them away (if they have the Maitrâvaruņa Sastra repeated); thence the Maitrâvaruņa priest repeats the Maitråvaruņa Sastra (887) at the morning libation. The Asuras, defeated on the right side, attacked the centre of the sacrifice. The Devas awoke, posted then Indra, and defeated through his assistance the enemies. Therefore the Brâhmanâchchhamsi repeats at the morning libation the Indra Shastra. 

The Asuras, thus defeated, attacked the sacrifice on the northern side. The Devas posted on this side Indrâgni, and defeated thus the Aburas. Therefore the Achhâvâka repeats the Aindragna Sastra at the morning libation. For, by means of Indragni, the Devas drove the Asuras and Rakşasas away from the northern side. 

The Asuras, defeated on the northern side, marched, arrayed in battle lines towards the eastern part. The Devas awoke and posted Agni easta wards at the morning libation. Through Agni, the Devas drove the Asuras and Rakşasas away from the eastern front. In the same way, the sacrificers drive away from the eastern front the Asuras and Rakşasas. Thence the morning libation is Agni's. He who has such a knowledge, destroys the evil consequences of his sin. - The Asuras, when defeated eastwards, went westwards. The Devas awoke and posted the Visve Devâh themselves (westwards) at the third libation, who thus drove the Asuras and Rakşasas away from the western direction at the third libation. Likewise, the sacrificers drive through the Visve Devâh themselves at the third libation the Asuras and Rakşas away. Thence the evining libation belongs to the Visve Devâh. He who has such a knowledge, destroys the consequences of his sin. 

In this manner, the Devas drove the Asuras out of the whole sacrifice. Thence the Devas became masters of the Asuras. He who has this know 

264 

ledge becomes therefore through himself (alone) master of his adversary and enemy, and destroys the consequences (388) of his sin. The Devas drove away the Asuras and destroyed the consequences of sin by means of the sacrifice arranged in such a way, and conquered the heaven-world. He who has this knowledge, and he who, knowing this, prepares (these) libation required in the said manner, drives away his enemy and hater, destroys the consequences of his guilt, and gains the heaven-world. 

(The Stotriya of the Following Day is made the Anurúpa of the Preceding 

Day in the Sastras of the Minor Hotri-priests at Soma Sarcrifices laste ing for Several Days.) 

They use at the morning libation the Stotriya (triplet) (of the following day) as Anurûpag. (of the preceding day). They make in this way the following day the Anurúpa (corresponding to the preceding day). Thus they commence the performance of the preceding day with a view to that of the following. But this is not done at the midday libation ; for the Prişthas' (used then) are happiness (they are independent) ; they have at this (the midday libation) not that position (which the verses have at the morning libation) that they could use the Stotriya (of the following day) as Anurûpa (of the preceding day). Likewise they do not use at the third libation, the Stotriya (of the following day) as Anurûpa (of the preceding day). 

(889) (The Opening Verses of the Sastras of the Minor Hotri-priests at the 

Akargana Soma Sacrifice, 1.e., such ones as last for a Series of Days.) 

Now follow the opening verses (of these Sastras after the Stotriyas have been repeated). Rijunitî no Varuna (1, 90, 1) is that of the Mai trâvaruņa Sastra ; for in its second pâda is said, "Mitra, the wise, may lead !” for the Maitråvaruņa is the leader of the Hotsi-priests. There fore is this the leading verse. - By Indram vo visvatas pari (1, 7, 10) commences the Brâhmanâa chchhamsi ; for by the words " we call him (Indra) to the people” they call 

werpen

2 The Såmans of the midday libation are called Pșişthas ; and the Stotriyas and Anura pas which accompany them, go by the same name.

Indra every day. When the Brâhmanâchchharsi, with this knowledge, recites this verse every day, then no other sacrificer, notwithstanding he (Indra) might be called by different parties (at the same time), can get Indra away. 

Yat soma â sute nara (7,94, 10) is the verse of the Achchhâvâka. By its words "they called hither Indrågni," every called Indrågni every day. When the Achchhâvâka is doing this every day, no other one can wrest (from them) Indragni. These verses (rijuníti &c.) are the boats which lead to the shores of the heavenly world. By their means the sacrificers cross (the sea) and reach the heavenly world. 

(The concluding verses of the same Śastras at the Ahargana 

Soma sacrifices.) Now follow the concluding verses of these Sastras: Te syâma devol varuna (7, 66, 9) is that of the Maitrâ varuņa Sastra. For by its words, “We contemplate food (işam) and light (svar)," they get [390] hold of both worlds ; for “ food” is this world, and "light" is that world. 

By the triplet vyantarikşam atirad (8, 14, 7-9), which has the char acteristic vi, i.e. asunder, the Brâhmanâchchhaxsi opens the gates of the heavenly world. The words, "Indra, inebriated by Soma, cleft the hole and made appear the lights" (8, 14, 7), refer to the passionate desire of those who are initiated into the sacrificial art (for heaven); thence it is called the Balavatı verse.* The words, “He drove out the cows, and revealed them which were hidden, to the Angiras, and flung away Bala'. contain the expression of a gift to them (the Angiras). By the words, “ indrena rochaná divi (verse 9) the heaven-world is alluded to." By the words, “The fixed lights (stars) of heaven have been fastened by Indra, the fixed ones he does not fling away," the sacrificers approach every day heaven and walk there. 

Aham sarasvativator (8, 38, 10), is the verse of the Achchhâvâka. For Sarasvati is the voice ; (the dual is used) for this day belongs to the "two who have the voice." (As to who they are is expressed by the words) “I choose the tone of Indrâgni." For the voice is the beloved residence of Indrâgni. Through this residence one makes both successful. Who has this knowledge, will be successful in his own residence (his own way). 

3 There is the word vala hole, in it, which may be regarded as a proper name of an Asura also. 

206 

(On the Ahina and Aikâhika concluding verses of the Sastras of the 

minor Hotri-priests.) The concluding verses of the Hotri-priests (Maitrâvaruņa, Brâhmana chchhamsi, and Achchhavâka) are, at (391] the morning and midday liba tions of two kinds, viz. âhina (which are proper for Soma sacrifices, which last for several days successively) and aikahika (which are proper for Soma sacrifices which last for one day only). The Maitrâvaruna uses the aikähikas preventing (thus) the sacrificer from falling out of this world. The Achehhâvâka uses the âbinas for making (the sacrificer obtain heaven) The Brahmañáchchhmsi uses both; for thus he holds both worlds (with his hands) and walks in them. In this way he (the Brahmanâchchhamsi) walks holding both, the Maitråvaruna and the Achchhâvâka, the Ahina and Ekâha, and (farther) the sacrifical session lasting all the year round (such as the Gavâm ayanam) and the Agnistoma (the model of all Aikihikas). 

The Hotri-priests require at the third libation Ekâhas only for con cluding. For the Ekaha is the footing, and thus they place the sacrifice at the end on a footing. 

At the morning libation he must read the Yâjyâ verses without stop, ping (anavånam). The Hotar shall not recite one or two additional verses (atisamsanam) for the Stoma. It is just the same case as if one who asks for food and drink must be speedily supplied. Thinking, I will quickly supply the gods their food, he speedily gets a footing in this world. He should make the Sastram at the two latter libations with an unlimited number of verses; for the heaven-world is unlimitted. (This is done) for obtaining the heaven-world. The Hotar may, if he like, recite those verses which the minor Hotri-priests used to repeat on a previous day. Or the Hotri-priests (may, if they like, repeat, those verses) which the Hotar (used to repeat on the previous day) (For Hotar as well as the Hotri-priests form parts of one (892] body only). For the Hotar is the breath, and the Hotri-priests are the limbs. This breath goes equally through the limbs. Thence the Hotar should, if he like, receite those verses which the minor Hotçi-priests used to recite on the previous day. Or the Hotit-priest (may, if they like, repeat those verses) which the Hotar (used to repeat on the previous day). The last verses of the hymns with which the Hotar concludes, are the same with the concluding verses of the minor Hotřî-priests at the evening 

*For the Ekaha sacrifices are the models of the others. 

libation. For the hotar is the soul, and the Hotri-priests are the limbs; the ends of the limbs are equal, therefore the (three) Hotri-priests use, at the evening libation, the same concluding verses.

THIRD CHAPTER. 

(The hymns for lifting the Chamasa (Soma cups).. The Praşthita Yâjyds 

of the seven Llotars concluding this ceremony. The two different kinds of Hotars. Explanation of some apparent anomalies in the perforo mances of the minor Hotris. The Jagati hymns for Indra. The concluding verses of the minor Hotri-priests. On a peculiarity in the Sastras of the Achchháváha.) 

(The number of verses which the Hotar has to repeat at the time of the 

Soma cups being lifted at the three libations.) When at the morning libation the Soma cups are lifted and filled he (the Maitrâvaruņa) recites the hymn de toa vahantu harayal (1, 116 the several verses of which contain the words vrisan (inale), pita (drunk), suta (squeezed), mad (drunk), are complete in their form and are addressed to Indra, for [393] the sacrifice is Indra's. He repeats Gayatris ; for Gayatri is the metre of the morning liabation. At the morning libation he recites nine verses only; one less (than ten). For the semen is poured in to a place made narrow (nyúna). At the midday libation he repeats ten verses ; for the semen which was poured in a narrow place grows very large, after having reached the centre of the woman's body. At the evening libátion he repeats nine* verses, one less than ten) ; for from a narrow place (represented by the third libation) men are born. If he recites these hymns complete, than he makes the sacrificer bring forth the embryo of his (spiritual body) begotten in the sacrifice, which is the womb of the gods. 

Some recite every time only seven verses at the morning, midday and evening libations, asserting that there must be as many Paronuvâkyâs as there are Yajyâs. Seven (Hotři priests) having their faces turned (towards the fire) receite the Yajgás, and pronounce Vauşat! Now they assert that those (seven verses) are the Puronuvâkyâs of these (seven 

They are the hymn, asavi devam gorichikam (76 21). * They are the hymn, ihopayáta savaso (4,37). 

400 

Yajyas) ; but the Hotar ought not to do so (to recite only seven verses.) For in this way they spoil the semen of the sacrificer, and conseqnently the sacrificer himself. 

The Maiträvaruņa carries in this way the sacrificer, for the sacrificer is the hynin, by means of nine verses from this world to the airy region; but by means of ten be carries him further on to that (heaven) world ; for the airy region is the oldest ; from that world he takes him by means of nine verses up to the celestial world. Those who recite (895) only seven verses, do not wish to raise the sacrificer to heaven, Therefore the hymns are to be recited complete onlys, 

10. 

(On the Prasthita Yajydse of the Hotars at the morning libation.) 

Some one (a theologian) has asked, When the sacrifice is Indra's, why do only two, the Hotar and Brâhmanâchhamsi, at the morning libation, for the Soma drops which are in readiness, repeat Yâjyâs where Indra's very name is mentioned, the Yájyâ of the Hotar being idam te somyam madhu (8, 54,8), that of the Brâhmaņâchchhamsi, indra tva vrişabham vayam (3, 40, 1)? 

When the other (priests) repeat verses addressed to different deities, how do they concern Indra ? For the Yajyâ of the Maitrâvaruņa is mitran vayam havâmahe (1, 23, 4), "we invoke Mitra ;' but in its words varunam somapitaye iie. "we call Varuņa to the Soma beverage;" there is an allu sion to Indra ; for whatever word refers to "drinking", hints at Indra. and pleases him. 

The Yâjyâ of the Potar is, Maruto yasa hi kşaye (1, 86, 1); its words sa sugopâtamo janah i.e. " he is the best protector," allude to Indra"; for Indra is the gopå, which is a characteristic of Indra. Thus he pleases Indra. 

The Yâjyâ of the Neştar is, agne patnér ind vaha (1, 22, 9); in its words, tvaştáram somapitaye, (895) there is an allusion to Indra; 

3 The hymns mentioned for the morning and evening libations contain cach nine, that mentioned for the midday libation ten verses, 

4 These Yåjyás are at each libation seven in number, and repated successively by tho so called 'seven Hotars' (Hotar, Maitråvaruga, Brāhmaṇachchhamsi, Potar, Nestar Agnidhra, and Achchhâvâka) when the Chamasa Adhvaryu or cup-bearers, are holding up the cups filled with some. As often as one of them has repeated his Yajyâ, libations from seven cups are thrown at the same time in the fire. The rest is to be drank by them. 

for Indra is Tvastar, which is a characteristic of Indra. Thus he pleases him. 

The Yajyâ of the Agnidhra is, Uksånndya (8, 43, 11); in its words Soma prişthaya vedhase, there is an allusion to Indra; for Indra is Vedhâs (striker, beater) which is a characteristic of Indra. Thus he pleases him. 

The verse of the Achchhâvâka, which is directly addressed to Indra, is complete, viz: prataryavabhir (8, 38, 7), (for in the last part of it there is the term Indrågnt). Thus all these verses refer to Indra. Though there are different deities mentioned (in them) (such as Mitra, Varuņa, &c.) the sacrificer does not satisfy other deities (alone). The verses being in the Gayatri metre, and this being sacred to Agni, sacrificer gains, by means of these verses, the favour of three deities, i. e. Indra, the nånâdevatâs or disferent deities, and Agni. 

11. (The hymn to be repeated over the Soma cups being lifted, and the Pras thita Yájyâs at the midday libation.) 

At the midday libation, when the Soma cups are being lifted, the Hotar repeats, Asdvi devam gorichikam (7, 21.1.). This hymn contains the words, vrişan, pita, suta, mad; its verses are complete in form and addressed to Indra. For the sacrifice belongs to Indra. The verses are in the Triştubh metre; for this metre is appropriate to the midday libation. They say, if the term mad "to be drunk" is only appropriate to the third libation, why do they recite such verses (containing this term) at the midday libation as Anuvâkyâs and Yâjyâs? The gods get drunk, as it were, at the midday libation, and are then consequently at the third libation in a state of [896] complete drunkenness. Thence he repeats verses contain ing the term mad as Anuvâkyâs and Yâjyâs at the midday libation. . 

At the midday libation all the priests repeat Yâjyâs addressed to Indra by his very name (for the Soma drops) which are in readiness. Some (the Hotar, Maitrâvaruņa, and Brâhmanâchchhamsi) make the Yajyas with verses containing (besides the name of Indra) the words, abhi trid. So the Hotar repeats, pibd somam abhi yan ugra tarda (6, 17, 1); the Maitrâvaruņa, sa im pahi ya pigishi (6, 17, 2); and the Brahman âchhamsi, evâ pâhi pratnatha (6, 17,3). 

The Yâjyâ of the Potar is, arvâng ehi somakaman (1, 104, 9). The Yajyâ of the Neşțar is, tacâ yam somas tvam (3, 35, 6). The Yâjyâ of the Achchhâvâka iş, indraya somah pra divo vidânâ (3, 36, 2). The Yajya of the Agnidhra is, âpúrnô asya kalasah sváha (3, 32, 15). 

Those three verses contain forms of the verb trid (Lat, trudere) "to injuro, to kill,"? with the proposition abhi. 

270 

Among these verses there are those containing the words abhi trid. For Indra once did conquer at the morning libation; but by means of these verses he broke down the barriers and made himself master (abhi trinat) of the midday libation. Thence these verses. 

12. (The hymn and the Prasthita Yajyás at the evening libation.) 

At the third libation the Hotar repeats at the time when the Soma cups are being lifted, the hymn ihopayâta savasó napatah (4, 35, 1). Its verses which are complete in form, are addressed to Indra, and belong to the Ribhus, contain the words vrişan, pita, (397) suta mad. They ask, Why is the Pavamana Stotra at the evening libation called Arbhava, though they do not sing Ribhu verses? (The answer is) Prajapati, the father, when transforming the Ribhus who were mortals, into immortals. gave them a share in the evening libation. Thence they do not sing Ribhu verses, but they call the Pavamâna Stotra Arbhava 

One (great Rişi) asked about the application of metres, viz, for what reason does he use the Triştubh metre at the third libation, whilst the appropriate metre for this libation is Jagati, as well as the Gâyatri that for the morning, and the Triştubh for the midday libation? One ought to say (in reply), At the third libation the Soma juice is done ; but if they use a sparkling ( śukriyam) metre as the Trişțubh, the juice of which is not done, then they provide the (third) libation with juice (liquor). Then he makes Indra participate in this libation also. One says, Why. since the third libation belongs to Indra and the Ribhus, and the Hotar alone makes the Yâjyâs for the Soma which are in readiness (prasthita) with an Indra-Ribhu verse, at the third libation, do the other Hotri priests use verses addressed to various other deities for their Yajyâs ? In the Yajyâ of the Hotar, ribhubhir vajadbhiḥ samukşitan (not in the Rigveda) the Ribhus are mentioned, but in the Yâjyâs of the other priests they are only hinted at. 

The Maitrâvaruņa repeats, indravaruna sutapåvimam sutam (6, 68, 10); in the words, yuvo ratho adhvaram devavitaye, there is a plurality (in the words devavitaye=devànám vitaye, i.e. for the enjoyment of the gods) which is a characteristic of the Ribhus. 

The Brahmanâchchhamsi repeats the verse, indraścha somam pibatam (4, 50, 10); in its words, visantu indavah, i. e." may the drops come," a (898) plurality is expressed, which is a characteristic of the Ribhus. 

271 

The Yajyâ of the Potar is, & vo vahantu saptayo (1, 85, 6); in its words, raghu atvanah prajigáta bâhubhir there is a plurality (these three words are in the plural) expressed, which is the characteristic of the Ribbus. 

The Yajya of the Neştar is, ameva nah suhava (2, 36, 3), in it the word gantana "go ye!" expresses a plurality. 

The Yâjyâ of the Achchhâvâka is, indravişnu pibatan madhvo (6, 69, 7); its words, à vậm amdhômsi madirant expresses a plurality, 

The Yâjyâ of the Agnidhra is, imam stoman arhate (1, 94, 1); in its words ratham iva sarmahemâ (this is first person plural) there is a plurality expressed. 

In this way all these verses become Aindra-Arbhavah. By repeating verses being (apparently) addressed to various deities, he pleases other deities (also), save Indra and the Ribhus. They are the conquerors of the jagat i. c. world ; therefore the Jagatî metre is required for the evening libation, to inake it successful. 

18. (On the relationship of those Hotars who have to repeat a Sastra to those who have none. How the Sastras of the minor Hotri-priests are supplied, at the evening libation.) 

Some one asks, Some of the duties of the Hotri-priests being performed without Sastra, some with Sastra, how are then all these ceremonies (as it (899) should be) provided with their respective Sastras, and consequent ly equal and complete ? (The answer is) They call the performance (i.e: the repetition of Yêjyâs) of those (Hotris) who like the Potar, Nestar, and Agnidhra, have no Sastra (to repeat) Hotrà (also), on account of their reciting their (respective) verses along with the other Hotri-priests, such as the Hotar, Maitrâvaruņa &c. who repeat proper Sastras). In this way they are equal. But in the fact that some Hotri-priests perform their duties with Sastras, others without Sastras, lies their inequality. Thus (both kinds of Hotri performances) become provided with Sastras, equalised and successful (for the Yâjyâs of all seven Hotri-priests are repeated one after the other).. 

Besides the Hotar only the Maiträvaruna, Brahmanachhamsi, and Achhâvâka repeat Shastras ; the others, such as the potar, &c. do not do it. But the former ropeat them at the Agnishtoma, only at the morning and midday libations,272 

14 

Now the Hotri-priests (Maitrâvaruņa, Brahmanâchchhamsi, Achchhê Vâka) repeat Sastras at the morning and midday libations only, in what way is this duty performed at the third libation ? One ought to answer, in this way, that they (these three priests just mentioned) repeat at the mid day libation two hymns each. Some one may ask, In what way do the Hotri-priests (who properly speaking repeat one Sastra only) repeat two Sastras, as many as the chief) Hotar? does ? One ought to answer, Their Yâjyâs are addressed to two deities. 

14. 1400) (How the Sastras of the Agnîdhra, Potar and Neştar are supplied. On the two Praişas to the Potar and Neştar. On the additional verse of the Achchhavaka. How the Praişa formula, hotâ yakşat, is applicable to the Potar, Neştar, and Agnidhra. The Prazşa for the chanters. The Praisa for the Achchhâvâka. On the inequality of the the deities of the Sastras and Stotriyas of the evening libation.) 

Some one asks further. If there are the performances of three Hotri priests only provided with a Sastra, how are these Sastras supplied for the performances of the others (the three remaining Lotri-priests) ? (The answer is) The Ajyam is the Sastra for the Yâjyâ repeated by the Agnidhra; the Marutvatiya that one for the Potar's Yâjyâ; the Vais vadevam that one for the Neştar's. These Yâjyâs have the characteristic sign of the respective Sastra.' 

Some one asks further, If the other Hotri-priests are requested only once (to repeat their Sastras), why are the Potar and Nestar requested twice ? 

(Regarding this the following story is reported). At the time when the Gâyatri having assumed the shape of an eagle, abstracted the Soma (from heaven), Indra (out of anger) cut off from these (three) Hotsi-priests (Agnidhra, Potar and Neştar) their Sastras, and transferred them to the Hotar, saying, "Do not call me, you are quite ignorant of it.” The gods said, “Let us give more strength to the performances of these two Hotri-priests (Potar and Neşțar) through Speech (by requesting them once 

* The Agoîdhra addresses the Yâjyâ to Agni, to whom the Ajya sastra belongs ; the Potar to the Marutas, to whom the Marutyatîya sastra belongs, and the Nestar to the Visvedevas, to whom the Vaišvadeva Sastra belongs. 

* The Hotar repeats at the morning libation the Ajya and Pra-uga Sastra, at the midday libation the Marutvatiya and Niskevalya sastra, and at the third libation the Vaišvadeva and Agnimâruta sastra. 

The Agnidhra addresses the Yajya to Agni, to whom the Ajya sastra belongs; the Potar to the Marutas, to whom the Marutvatiya sastra belongs, and the Nestar to my the Viśvedevas, to whom the Vaišvadeva Şastra belongs. 

(401) more than the others). Thence come the two requests (for Neştar and Potar). The performance of the Agnidhra was strengthened by one additional verse to his Yâjyâ; therefore his Yâjyâs are supernumerary by one verse. 

Some one asks, When the Maitrâ varuņa calls upon the Hotar by the words, “ may the Hotar repeat the Yajya ! may the Hotar repeat the Yajya !" why does he call upon those who are no Hotras, but only the repeaters of Hotfi verses, by the same words, "may the Hotar repeat the Yâjyên ?" (The answer is) The Hotar is life, and all the (other) sacrifi cial priests are life also. The meaning (of the formula “may the Hotar repeat his Yâjya," is) "may the life repeat the Yâjyâ, may the life repeat the Yâjyå !" 

If some one asks further, Are there requests for the Udgâtri priests (to chant)? One should answer, Yes, there are. For if all (the priests) are ordered to do their respective duties, then the Maiträvaruņa, after having muttered with a low voice (a mantra), says, “praise ye !"8 These are the summons for the Udgâtsi priests. 

Some one asks, Has the Achchhâvâka any preference (to the other priests) ? The answer is, Yes, he has ; for the Adhvaryu says to him, " Achchhåvaka, speak what you have to speak (and no more) !" 

Some one asks, Why are at the evening libation the Stotriya and Anurûpa verses addressed to Agni, whilst the Maiträvaruņa at that time repeats an Indra-Varuņa Sastra? (The answer is) The Devas turned the Asuras out of the Sastras by means of Agni as their mouth. 

Therefore the Stotriya and Anurûpa are addressed to Agni. 

(402) Some one asks, Why are both the Stotriya and Anurûpa of the singers devoted to Indra at the evening libation, whilst the Sastram repeat ed by the Brâhmanâchchhamsi is addressed to Indra and Brihaspati, and that of the Achchhâvâka to Indra and Vişnu? (The answer is) Indra turned the Asuras out from the Sastras (of which they had got hold) and defeated them. He said to the Devas, "Which (from among you) follows me ?," They said, “T, I,10 (we will follow)," and thus the Devas fellowed. But on account of Indra having first defeated (the Asuras) the Stotriya and Anurûpa of the singers (they precede the Shastram) are addressed to Indra. And on account of the other deities having said, “I, I, (will follow)" and (actually) followed, both the Brâhmanâchhamsi and Achchhậ Vâka repeated hymns addressed to several deities. 

* See note to 5, 34. 

That is, is there anything exceptional to be seen in the performance of his duties ? This refers to the peculiar praisa given to him, which is mentioned in the contexto See also Ašv, Sr. S, 5, 7.

15. (On the Jagati hymns addressed to Indra at the evening libation. On the hymn of the Achchhâváka. The concluding verses of the Maitråvaruna Brahmanâchchhause, and Achchhäváka. The last four syllables of the last Sastra of the Soma day to be repeated twice.) 

Some one asks further, For what reason do they repeat at the comi mencement of the evening libation hymns addressed to Indra, and composed in the Jagatî metre, whereas the evening libation belongs to the Višvedevas ? (The answer is) Having got hold of Indra (arabhya having commenced with him) by means of these (hymns), they proceed to act, being sure of success). The Jagatî metre is used because the evening libation belongs to the Jagatî, implying a desire for this world (Jagat); and any metre (403) which is used after this commencement) becomes related to the Jagati (jagat) if, at the beginning of the evening libation, hymns in the Jagati metre are repeated which are addressed to Indra. 

At the end of the Sastra) the Achchhâvâka repeats a hymn in the Tristubh metre, samvam karmanâ (6, 69, 1.) The word karma (ceremony) alludes only to the praise of drinking (the Soma)." In the words sam işâ the word işå means food; it (serves) for obtaining food (by means of this mantra.) (By the words of the last pada) " both (Indra and Visnu) carry us through on safe paths,” he pronounces every day's something relating to welfare. 

Some one asks, Why do they conclude the evening libation by Triş tubhs, if properly the Jagati metre should be used at it ? Triştubh is strength; (by repeating at the end Trişțubhs) the priests (who are at the Sattras the sacrificers themselve) get finally possessed of strength. 

The concluding verses of the Maitrâvaruņa is, iyam Indram Varunam (7, 84, 5.) That of the Brâhmaņâchhamsi is, Brihaspatir na paripâtu (10, 42, 11.) That of the Achchhâvâka is, ubhâ jigyathur (6, 69, 8.) For "both (Indra and Vişnu) had been victorious jigyathuḥ, i. e., they bad not sustained any defeat, neither of them was defeated ”18 

11 The word alluded to is, panayya, which is traced to a root pan=pan to praise ; but it hardly can mean praising" in general. It refers, as Sâyana justly reparks, to the ** drinking of the Soma juice.” In the fifth verse of the bymn in question, we have the word panaya yyri, which is the same as panayyu, where the words indravişú tat panaya yyan van evidently mean, “this is your praise for having drunk the Soma," 

12 The hymn is to be repeated every day on the Soma sacrifices which last for several days, 

18 This is a paraphrase by the author of the Brahmanam of the first half of the verso 6, 89, 8 (ubha jägyathur.) it differs little from the original, and retains most of the terms 

275 

[404] In the words indraś cha Vişno yat apaspridhetħamle (there is hinted) that Indra and Vişnu fought with the Asuras. After they had defeated them, they said to them, "Let us divide!" The Asuras accepted the offer. Indra then said, "All through which Vişnu makes his three steps is ours, the other part is yours." Then Indra stepped through these (three worlds), then over the Vedas, and (lastly) over Vâch. 

They ask, What is meant by the “sahasram,"16 a thousand ? One should say in reply, these worlds, the Vedas, and Vâch. The Achebbâvâ.com ka repeats twice the (fast) word arrayetham, i.e., “you both (Indra and Vişnu) strode," at the Oktbya sacrifice; for the part (repeated) by the Achhâvâka, is the last in it; whereas at the Agniştoma and Atirâ trai the Hotar (repeats twice the four last syllables of his Sastra); for (tho part recited by him) is in these (405) saerifices, the last. At the Solasi there it is questionable whether or not (the last four syllables) are to be repeated twice. They say, He ought to repeat them twice, for why should he repeat them twice on the other days, and not on this one ? Therefore, he should repeat them twice (also at the Soļasl.) 

18. (Why the Achchhäváha at the end of his Silpa-Sastra does not recite 

verses addressed to Naråsariasan.) Some one further asks, Why does the Achhâvâ ka at the end, in his. Silpas, recite verses not addressed to Narâšansa at the third lībation, although this libation belongs to Narâšansa ? The Narâšaosa part repre sents the change (of the semen into the human form); for the semen be comes by and by somewhat changed that which then has undergone the of the verse without giving any substitute for them. This shows, that many verses and turns of speech in the mantras were perfectly intelligible to the author of the Brahmam. nas. The only difference of the paraphrase from the original is the substitution of tayoh for enoh, which is an uncommon dual form (gen.) of a demonstrative form ; one ought to expect enayoh. 

14 This is the second half of the last verse of 6,69,8, which concludes the bymr repeated by the schchhâvâka. The author of the Bräbmapam explains it also by reporting a story to which he thinks the contents of this latter half allude. However he does not quite overlook the meaning of several terms ; apaspridhetam he explains by uyudhate, "they two have fought," and vyairayethâm by vichakrame, she stepped through." The meaning of these words is certainly correct; but the grammatieal strueture is misunderstood by our author ; atrayetham is taken by him as a singular, thongh it is a dual, for it refers to both Indra and Vişna, and not to Vişnu alone. 

15 In the last pada of the last verse abiiri jugyathur. There the words tredha sahasram vi tad arrayetham mean " ye both strode thrice through this thousand" The thousand** refers to the booty they made in the battle, or perhaps to tho“ thousand cows" given 28 Peward at great sacrifices 

210 

change becomes the pra jâiam (the proper form.):Or the Narâšaro sum is a soft and loose motre, as it were ; and the Achchhâvâka is the last reciter; therefore (it cannot be used), for (the priests think) We must put the end in a firm place for obtaining stability. Therefore the Achha vâka does not repeat at the end, in his Silpas, verses referring to Nara samsa."?

FOURTH CHAPTER.

The Dürohanam.) 

17. 

(See 6, 5.) When they make at Soma sacrifices, which require several days for their performance (ahinas) in order to make them continuous, at the morning libation, the singing verse (Stotriya) of the following day, the Anurûpa of the preceding day, it is just the same as with the performance of a Soma sacrifiice which lasts for one day only (ekdha.) For just as the (three) libations of the one day's Soma sacrifice are connected with each other, in the same way are the days of a Soma sacrifice which lasts for several days connected with one another. The reason that they make at the morning libation, the singing verse (Stotriya) of the following day, the Anurapa of the preceding day, is to make the days during which the sacrifice lasts one continuous series. Thus they make the days of the Abina sacrifices one continuous whole. 

The Gods and Rişis considered. Let us make the sacrifice continu ous by equalising (its several days.) They then saw this equality (of the several parts) of the sacrifice, viz. the same Pragathas, the same Pratipads (beginning triplets), the same hymns. For Indra walks in the sacrifice on the first as well as on the following day, just as one who has occupied a house. (The Soma days are thus equalised) in order to bave (always) Indra (present.): 

14 Sây. says, “For seven nights after the coition the semen has the form of a bubble a fortnight after it is changed into a ball, which, if the change has been completed, assumes the proper (haman or animal) form." The Narasansan is the state of transition for the semen from the bubble into the ball form. Therefore in order not to disturb and stop the course of this change, no verses, referring to the imperfect state, can be repeated. 

11 See on them 6, 32. 

277 

18. On the Sampata hynn. The counter-Sampata hymns. On a peculiarity in the use of the hymn of the Achchhavâka. 

Vibyâmitra saw for the first time (the so-called) (407] Sampâta hymns; but Vâmadeva made those seen by Visvâmitra known to the public (aśrijata). These are the following : evd trâm indra (4, 19); yanna indro (4, 22); kathâ mahâm avridhat (4, 23). He went at once after them (samapatat) and taught them his disciples. Thence they are called Sampátas. 

Visvamitra then looked after them, saying, “The Sampâta bymns which I saw, have been made publics by Vâmadeva; I will counteract these Sampâtas by the publication of other hymns which are like them. Thus he made known as counterparts the following bymns : sadyô ha játo vrişabhaḥ (3, 48); indraḥ půrbhid âtirad (3, 34); imamu şu prabhrż tim (3, 36); ichhanti två somyasaḥ sakhâyaḥ (3, 30); śásad vahnir duhitur (3, 31); abhi taşteva didhayô manişâm (3, 38); (Other Sampâta hymns are), the hymn of Bharadvâja, ya eka id dhavyas (6, 22); those of Vasis tha, yas tigmasringo vrişabho na bhima (7, 19), ud u brahmanairata (7, 23); and that of Nodhâs asmå id u pratarase (1, 61). 

These Hotri-priests (Maitrâvaruņa, Brahmanâchhamsi, and Achchhâ vâka) after having recited at the morning libation of the six days' sacrifice the Stotriya verses, repeat at the midday libation the hymns or the several days' sacrifices (ahina). These hymns are ê satyo yatu maghavan (4, 16); for the Maiträvaruņa (by whom it is to be repeated) is endowed with satya, i. e. truth. The Brahmanachhamsi repeats, asma id u pratavuse (1, 61); for in this hymn there occur the words indraya brahmânâ rîtatama (in the fourth pada of the first verse), and Indra brahmani Gotamâso ak rann (verse 16), 2. e. the Gotamas have made the prayers, Indra ! in which the word "brahma” is mentioned. T'he Achchhâvâka [408] repeats śâsad vahnir (3, 31), in which the words janayanta vahnim (verse 2) occur; for he is the Vahni (guide). 

Some one asks, Why does the Achchhâvâka repeat in both kinds of days' (of the Gavâm ayanam sacrifice) this Vahni hymn in those days which stand by themselves (parañchi) as well as those which form 

* This is the meaning of the expression sama patat. 1 The term is sriy to emit 

3 This refers to two classes of days of which a great Sattra consists, 2. e, single days, which only once occur in the course of the session, and regular periods of the same length which follow one another. Sce page 279, 

278 

regular periods (of six days) one following the other (abhyävarti)? The answer is, the Bahvřicha (Rigveda) priest (i.e one of the Hotris) is endowed with power, and the Vahni hymn leads (vahati); for the Vahni (guide horse) draws the beams to which he is yoked. Therefore the Achchhâvâka repeats the Vahni hymns in both classes of days. 

These Ahîna* hymns are required during the five days in the Gavâm ayanam), viz. on the Chaturvimša, Abhijit, Vişuvat, Visvajit and Mahâyrata days; for these (five) days (though the performance of each lasts for one day only) are ahinas, for nothing is left out (na hiyate) in them; they (further) "stand aloof” and do not re-occur in the other turn (as is the case with the Salabas). Thence the Hotri. priests repeat on these (five) days the Ahîna Sûktas. When they repeat them, then thay think, " may we obtain the heaven-worlds undiminished, in their full forms and integrity.” When they repeat them, they call hither Indra by them, just as one calls a bullock to a cow. They repeat them for making uninterrupted the series of sacrificial days. Thus they make them uninterrupted. 

[409] 19. (On that days, in what order, and by whom the Sampáta hymns are to be 

repeated. The Avapana hymns.) Thereupon the Maitriâváruna repeats on every day (of the Salaba, but not on those five days mentioned) one of the three Sampatas, inverting their order (in the second three days performance of the Sa Jaha). On the first day he repeats evå tvam indra; on the second, yanna indro jujuşe; and on the third, kathâ mahôm avridhat. 

The Brahmaņâchchhamsi repeats three Sampå ta hymns, every day one, inverting their order (in the second three days performance), viz. púrbhid âtirad on the first day ; eka id dhavyas on the second ; and yas tigmas gingo, on the third day. 

In the same manner the Achchhâvâka repeat three Sampåtas, every day one, viz. imam u şu prabhritim on the fisrt day, ichhanti två somyasal on the second day, and śâsad vahni on the third day. 

These three (for there are every day three to be repeated) and nine (nine is the number of all taken together) hymns, to be recited day after day, make twelve in all. For the year consists of twelve months, Prajapati is 

* The Sampatas which are mentioned here are meant. 

• They are here called ahinas from a purely etymological reason. Strictly speaking, they are aikähikus. 

**This is the real meaning of the term viparyúsam. In the second Tryaha of the Salaba, the hymn which was the first in the first Tryaha is mado the last, and the last the barst 

WA 

the year, the sacrifice is Prajapati. They obtained thus this sacrifice, which is Irajâpati, who is the year, and they place thus every day's performance in the sacrifice, in Prajapati, and in the year. 

Between these hymns they ought to insert the Virâj verses by Vimada, to be recited without Nyünkha on the fourth, the Pañkti verses on the fifth, and the Paruchhepa verses on the sixth day. Then on the [410] days when the Mahâstomas are required (the Chhandomâ days) the Maiträvaruna inserts ko adya naryo devakâma (4, 25, 1), the Brahmaņâcbchhamsi, vanena váyo nyadhấyi (10, 29, 1), and the Achchhâvâka, åyåhy arvamg upą (3, 43, 1). These are the Avapana hymns (intercalary hymns), by means of which the Gods and Rişis conquered the heaven-world, and by means of which the sacrificers conquer lieaven (also). 

20. 

(On the hymns repeated by the Maiträvaruna, dc, which precede the 

Sanpätas). Before the (Ahîna) hymns are repeated, the Maitrâvaruņa repeats every day, sadyo ha jito vrişabhah (3, 48). This hymn leads to heaven; for by means of this hymn the Gods conquered the heavenly world, and the Rişis did the same ; by means of it the sacrificers also conquer the heavenly world. This is a Visvâmitra hymn, for Vigvamitra (all friend) was the friend of all; therefore all will be friendly towards him who has this knowledge, if the Maitrâvaruņa knowing this repeats (this hymn) every day before the Ahina Sûktas. This hymn (sadyo ha) contains the word "bull," and is therefore apaśumat (having cattle), serving for obtaining cattle. It consists of five verses ; five-hood com prises five feet, and five-hood is food for obtaining (which this hymn is useful). The Brahmanâchhamsi repeats every day the Brahmâ hymn, whice is complete, ud u brahmâny airata (7, 23). 

This hymn leads to heaven; by means of it the Gods conquered the heavenly world, and the Rişis did the same; by means of it the sacri ficers conquered the heavenly world. It is a Vasiştha hymn ; by means of it Vasiştha obtained Indra's favour, and conquered the highest world. Io who has such a [411] knowledge, obtains Indra's favour, and con quers the highest world. It consists of six verses; for there are six seasons; in order to gain the seasons (ritus), he repeats it after the Samapatas. For the sacrifiers have thus a firm footing in this world, in order to reach the heavenly world (after death). 

280 

The Achchhåvâka repeats every day, abhi taşļeva didhaya (3, 38). This hymn contains the characteristic abhi (towards) in order to establish a connection (with the other world). Its words " abhi priyani marmrišať parâni,'' mean that the other days (those in the other world) are lovely, and that they are seizing them (securing them). Beyond (para) this world is the heaven-world, to which he thus alludes. 

When repeating the words, kavimrichchhamni saṁdrise sumedha, i.e. "I wish to see the wise prophets," he means by kavis the departed Rişis. This hymn (abhi taşteva) is a Vigvamitra hymn, for Visvâmitra was friend to all ; every one will be friendly to him who has this knowledge. 

He repeats this hymn which belongs to Prajapati, though his name is not expressly mentioned aniruktam only hinted at) in it. For Praja pati cannot be expressed in words. (This is done) in order to obtain (com munion with) him. In this hymn the name “Indra " is once mention ed? ; but this is only for the purpose of preserving the Indra form of the sacrifice (to Indra chiefly belongs the sacrifice). It consist of ten verses. For the Virâj consists of ten syllables, and the Virâj is food; it serves for obtaining food. As regards the number ten (of these) verses, it is to be remarked that there are ten vital airs. The sacrificers thus obtain the vital airs, and connect them with one another. [412] The Achchhâvâka repeats this hymn after the Sampatas in order to secure the heavenly world (for the sacrificers), whilst the sacrificers move in this world. 

21. 

(The Kadvat hymns.' The Triştubhs). The beginning Pragâthas of every day are the kadavntas (containing the interrogative pronoun kas who?) viz. kas tam Indra (7, 32, 14-15), kannvayo (8, 3, 13-14), kad Ú nu asya (8, 55, 9-10). By kas i.e., who? Pra jâpati is meant; these Kadvantah Pragathas are suitable for obtaining 

In the last verse (3, 38, 10); but several times alluded to by the name " vrişabha," i. e. buil, 

8 The Sastras of the minor Hotri-priests being at the Dvadasâba and Sattras rather complicated, I here give some hints as to the order of their several parts. At the midday libation, after the Hotar has finished his two Sastras, the Maitråvaruna, Brah mapachhamsi, and Achchhâvâka repeat one after the other the several parts of their Sas tras in the following order : (1) Stotriya and Anûrupa. (2) One of the three Tristabh verses as introductory to the Ahîna bymns and the Kadvantah Pragathas. (3) The Ahina hymns, of which each has to repeat two, viz. the Maitråvarupa sadyo ha játa, the Braun manichhansi aśma id ni pra tavase, and the Achchha paka sasad vunnit ; and further, the

Prajapati. Kam (old neuter form of kas) signifies food, the kadvantas there fore serve for obtaining food. For the sacrificers are every day joined to the Ahina hymns, which become (by containing the term kam i. e. happy) propitiated. They make by means of the kadvad Pragathas propitiation (for the sacrificers). When thus propitiated, these (Abina hymns) become (a source of) happiness for them (the sacrificers) and thus carry them up to the celestial world. [418] They ought to repeat the Triştubhs as the beginning of the (Ahina) hymns. Some repeat them before these Pragathas, calling them (these Trşhtubhs) Dbâyyâs. But in this way one should not proceed. For the Hotar is the ruler, and the performances of the minor Hotri-priests are the subjects. In this way (by repeating Dhâyyâs which ought to be repeated by the Hotar alone) they would make the subject revolt against his ruler, wbich would be a breach of the oath of allegiance." 

(The repetition of these Triştubhs by the minor Hotpi-priests is, however, necessary). He ought to know," these Triştubhs are the helm (pratipad) of my hymns," just as (one requires a helm) if crossing the sea. For those who perform a session lasting for a year or the Dvadas âha, are floating like those who cross the sea. Just as those who wish to land on the shore enter a ship having plenty of provisions, '° in the same manner the sacrificers should enter (i.e., begin with these Trişțubhe. For if this metre, which is the strongest, has made the sacrificer go to heaven, he does not return (to the earth). But he does not repeat at the beginning) of the several Triştubhs the call somsavoms; for the metre must run in one and the same strain (without any interruption, through the call somsavom, in order to be successful). 

The Hotar further ought to think, I will not make the Dhâyyâs, if they recite those (Triştubhs), and further, let us use as a conveyance the hymns with their well known introductory verses (the Trişțubhs). If they then repeat these verses (Tristubbs), they [214] call hither by them Indra, just as a bullock is called to the cow. If they repeat them,

(5) The Sampata hymns, see 6, 19. The principal parts of the Sastras of the minor Hotri-priests are only the two latter, the hymns and verses which precede being regarded only as intercalary (ävapana); thence the Kadvantah Pragathas are here called arainbhaniya, i.e. beginning Pragathas. See on the whole Ašval. br. 8. 7, 4.

it is for making the sacrificial days continuous. Thus tbey make the sacrificial days continuous.

(The Triştubhs of the minor Hatris.) 

· The Maitrâvaruņa repeats every day before the hymns (the Triş tubhlapa průcha Indra (10, 131, 1), in which the idea of safety is expressed ; in the words, " Drive away from round about us all enemies : drive them away, O conqueror ! May they be in the south or north, prostrate (all) O hero! that we may enjoy thy far-extended shelter !" For he (the Main - trâvaruņa) wishes to be in safety (thence he has to repeat this verse). 

The Brahmanâchchhamsi repeats every day Bruhmâna te brahmayuja (3, 35, 4). By the word yunajmi, "I join," the idea of " joining" is inti mated; for the sacrificial days are joined, which is the characteristic of (all) sacrifices which last for a series of days (the Ahinas). 

The Achchhâvâka repeats every day, urum no lokam anuneshi (6, 47, 8). For the term anu" after," implies the idea of going (after), as it were, which is a characteristic of the Ahina sacrifices (for one day follows the other); whereas neşi is a characteristic of a six monthly period of a sacrificial session, 

These verses are recited every day, as well as the concludingil verses, which are every day the same, 

Indra is the occupant of their (of the sacrificer's) house, he is at their sacrifice. Just as the ball goes [415] to the cow, and the cow to her well-known stable, so does Indra go to the sacrifice. He ought not to conclude the Ahina with the verge sunam havema (3, 30, 22), for the king loses his kingdom if he calls him who becomes his enemy (rival). 

How to join and disconnect the Ahênas. There is a joining as well as a disconnecting of the Ahina sacrifice. By the mantra oy antarikşam atirad (8, 14, 7-9) the Brahmanâchchhamsi joins the Ahinas (at the morning libation); by eved Indra (7. 23, 6) he dissolves them (at the midday libation). 

11 These are according to Say.. nu stuta indra (4, 16, 21) repeated by the Maitra varupa ; eved indran (7, 23, 6) repeated by the Brahmanachchhainsi ; and núnam sc tc (, 11 22) repeated by the Achchhà vâka. 

283 

By the mantra â ham sarasvativator (8, 38, 10) the Achchhäráka joins them, and by nuram sa te (2, 11, 22) (he dissolves then). 

By te syama deva Varuna (7, 66, 9) the MaitrâTaruna (joins them), and by nu ştuta (4, 16, 21) he dissolves them.a 

He who knows how to join (at the morning libation) and to disconnecí (at the midday libation ) is enabled to spread the thread of the sacri ficial days (Ahinas). Their (general) junction consists in their being joined on the Chaturvinsa day; and their (general) disconnection in disconnecting them before the concluding Atirâtra (on the labâ vrata) day When the Hotri-priests would conclude on the Chaturviša day with verses appropriate to the Ekahas, then they would bring the sacrifice to a close, without performing the ceremonies referring to the Ahinas. When they would conclude with the concluding verses of the Ahina days, then the sacrificers [416] would be cut off, just as a bullock) who is tired must be cut off, (from the rope, for be does not move). They ought to conclude with both the Ekaha and Ahina verses, just as a man setting out on a long journey takes from station to station fresh animals. Thence their sacrifice becomes connected, and they themselves (the sacrificers) find relaxation. 

He ought not to overpraise the stoma (i. e. not to repeat more verses than the singers chant) at the two (first) libations by (more than) one or two verses. When the Stoma is overpraised with many verses, (i. e. more than two) then they become for the Hotar like extensive forests (through which he has to pass without a resting place). At the third libation (he ought to overpraise the stoma) with an unlimited number of verses. For the heavenly world has no limits. (This serves) for obtaining the celes tial world. The Ahîna sarifice of him who with such a knowledge extends it, remains, if once commenced, undisturbed. 

(The nature of the Valakhilya Sastra 13 How to repeat it.) 17 The verbs jimuti hati as well as yuikte are here used in an elliptical sense (ETCH . To the former, yuikte, and to the latter, vimuschati is to be supplied, each thus implying its contrariety. 

19 The way of repeating the so called Válakbilya Sastra, the text of which consists of the Vâlakhilya verses, now arranged in eight hymns, is very artificial, and considered as the most difficult task to be achieved by a Hotri-priest. It is repeated in a manper similar to the repetition of the Solasi Sastra (gee page 258). The most general term for the peculiar way of repeating both the Vâlakbilya and Solaíí Sastras is vihara, that is, the dissecting of a verse by joining to each of its padas, ar pada taken from another verse, and reciting then both parts in such a way as if they were forming only one verse The way in which the Vâlakbilyas are repeated is a modification of the vikära. It is called vyatimarśa. This consists in a mutual transposition of the several på das or half verses, or whole verses of the first and second Valakhiya hymns, which are repeated in sets, always two being taken together. The first two are to be repeated påda by

24. The gods after having perceived the cows to be in the cavern, 14 wished to obtain them by means of a sacrifice. They obtained them by means of the sixth day.18 They bored at the morning liba tion the cavern with the bore mantra (nabháka). After having suc ceeded in making an opening, they loosened (the stones), and then, at the third libation, broke up the cavern by means of the Valakhilya verses, with the Ekapadà as váchah kata, which served as a weapon and drove the cows out. In this way the sacrificers bore the cavern at the morning libation by means of the Nabhaka, and make, by boring, its structure loose. Hence the Hotri-priests repeat at the morning libation the Nabhaka triplet. The Maiträvaruņa repeats, yah kakubho nidharaya (8, 41, 4-6); the Brâbhmaņâchchhamsi), púrvîşta indra (8, 40, 9-11); the Achchhâvâka, tà hi madhyam bharánâm (8, 40, 3-5). 

pâda: the third and fourth by half verses; the fifth and sixth by wholo verses (Asy. śr. S. 8. 2). The general rule for this transposition is expressed by Aśval E T AT मुत्तरस्य द्वितीयवोत्तरस्थ प्रथमा पूर्वस्थ द्वितीया i.e, he must join the first verse (or half verse or pâda, as the case may be) of the first hymn with the second verse of the following hymn, and then the first of the following hymn with the second of the first. Two such verses form then one Pragatha. 

In order to better illustrate the way of transposition, I bero subjoin an instance The first verse of the first Valakhilya hymn is as follows: 

Abhi pra vah suradhasam indram archa yatha vide Yo jaritrıbhyo maghavd purūvasuh sahasreneva śiksati The second verse of the second hymn is : Šatani ka hetaya asya duştará indrasyu samişo mahih, Girir na bhujmâ maghavastu pinvate yadin sutâ amandipuh. 

If the several pâdas of these two verses are to be mutually transposed, it is thon done in the following way : 

(1) Abhi pra vah suradhasam indrasya samişo mahih. 

satanika hetayo asya duştará indram archâ yatha vidom. (2) Yojaritribhyo maghava purüvasar yadim suta amandişuh. 

Girir na bhugmå maghavutsu pinvate sahasrena śiksatom. 

At the end of the five first Pragatha verses an Ekapada or verse containing one pada only is added. Four of them belong to the performance of the tenth day. These are according to Asval, (8, 2): "(1) indra visvasya goputih ; (2) indra viśva sya bhüpatiḥ ; (3) indra viśvasya chetati ; (4) indra visvasya rajati. The fifth is from the Mahávrata day, sânvendro viśvam virajati. These äve Ekapadás are not joined to the Pragatha without a stop after the latter. (TTTTertag ara NITHY: Tea Ašv. 8,2.) 

The Pragatha with the Ekapada belonging to it is the vâchah kútah, i.e. the point of speech, according to Sâyapa. But this appears not to be quite correct. According to an unmistakable indication in Ait. Br. 6,24 (upâpto vâchah kúta ekapadáyam) it can mean only the Ekapadâ which is added to the Pragatha, 

** This story is frequently alluded to in the Samhita of the Rigveda. " See page 335. 

At the third libation they break up the cavern with the Vâlakhilya verses, and the one footed Váchah kúta which served as a weapon, and obtain the cows. There are six Vâlakhilya hymns. He repeats them in three terms; for the first time be repeats them foot by foot, dissecting the verse by insertion; for the second time half verse by half verse; and for the third time verse by verse. When he repeats them foot by foot, dis secting the verse by insertion, then he ought to put in every Pragatha verse (of which each hyma is composed) one additional foot (ekapadđ ), which is the Vâchah kúlan, i.e. the point of the Vâch. There are five such Ekapadâs, four of them being taken from the tenth day and one . from the Mahâvrata sacrifice. 

He ought (if the two verses joined should fall short of a proper Pragatha by eight syllables) to supply the eight syllables from the Mahânâmnis16 as often as they might be wanting; for the other pâdas (of the Mahânâmnis which he does not require for filling up the deficiency in the Pragatha) be ought not to care. 

When reciting the Valakhilyas half verse by half verse, he ought to repeat those Ekapadâs; and the [419] pâdas from the Mahânâmnis which consist of eight syllables. When repeating the Valakbilyas verse by verse, he ought (also) to repeat those Ekapadâs, and the padas of eight syllables which are taken from the Mahânâmnis. When he repeats, for the first time, the six Vâlakhilya hymns, then he mixes (viharata) breath and speech by it. When he repeats them for the second time, then he mixes the eye and mind by it. When he repeats them for the third time, then he mixes the ear and the soul by it. Thus "every desire regarding the mixing (of the verses) becomes fulfilled, and all desires regarding the Vâlakhilyas, which serve as a weapon, the Váchah kûţa in the form of an Ekapadà and the forma tion of life will be fulfilled (also). 

He repeats the (Vâlakhilya) Pragathas for the fourth time without mixing the verses of two hymns. For the Pragathas are cattle. (It serves) for obtaining cattle. He ought not to insert (this time) an Ekapada in it Were he to do so, then he would cut off cattle from the sacrificer by slaying them. (If one should observe a Hotri-priest doing so) one ought to tell him at this occasion, thou hast cut off cattle from the sacrificer by slaying them with the point of speech (váchah kůta) thou hast deprived him of cattle (altogether). And thus it always happens. Thence one ought never to insert the Ekapadâs at this occasion. 

20 See page 281. 

om uw 

: The two last Valakhilya hymns (the seventh and eighth 17) he adds as a setting (cover). Both are mixed. In such a way, Sarpe, the son of Vatsa, repeated them for a sacrificer, Subala by name. He said, "I have now grasped for the sacrificer the largest number of cattle, the best ones (as a reward for my skill) will come to me.” He then gave (420) him (Sarpi) as much Dakşiņâ, 18 as to the great priests (Hotar, Adhvaryu, Udgâtar, Brahma). This Sastra procures cattle and heaven. Thence one repeats it 

25. (What kind of hymn ought to be chosen for the Dürohanam.) He recites a hymn in the Darohaņa way, about which a Brâhmaņam has been already told (4, 20). If the sacrificer aspires to cattle, then an Indra hymn is required for this purpose. For cattle belong to Indra ; it should be in the Jagati metre, for cattle have the nature of Jagati, they are (movable); it should be a great hymn (a mahasukta) ;19 for then he places, by it, the sacrificer among the largest number of cattle. He may choose for making Dûrohaņam the Baru hymn (seen by the Rişi Baru), which is a large hymn and in the Jagati metre.20 

For one who aspires after a firm footing, an Indra-Varuņa hymn is required; for this performance of the Maitravaruņa (his hotrd) belongs to this deity ; (and) the Indra-Varuņa21 (Yâjyà) is the conclusion of it. It is the Daksiņâ of the great priests. 

(421) This (Dûrohaņa repetition) puts (the reciter) finally in his own place (keeps him in his position). As regards the Indra-Varuņa hymn, it is at this occasion (when performing the Dürohanam) a Nivid (i.e like it). By means of the Nivid all desires become gratified. When he should use an Indra-Varuņa hymn for the Dûrohanam, then he ought to choose a hymn by Suparņa. Thus a desire regarding Indra-Varuna and one regarding Suparņa 22 become gratified (at the same time).

18 The term is only ninaya, to which dakşinâ“on the right side" is to be supplied. Cows horses, &c., which are given as a sacrificial reward, are actually carried to tho right side of the recipient. The word daksinä itself is only an abbreviation of dakşin á nita, " what has been carried to the right side" Very soon the word was used as a feminine substan tive. The noun to be suppliedis diś, direction, The repeater of the Valakhilya Sastra is the Maiträvaruña, who as one of the minor Hotri-priests, obtaios generally only half the Dakşina of the great priests,

(Whether or not the Maiträvaruna should repeat the Ahina and Ekdhe hymns along with the Dúrohanam.) 

Thoy (the interpreters of Brahma) ask, Shall he recite together (with these Durghanas the Ahîna hymns which are required on the sixth day) or shall he not do so ? To this question they answer, he shall recite them; for why should he recite them on all other days, and not do so on this day ? But (others) say he ought not to recite them together with these hymns; % for the sixth day represents the heavenly world; the heaven-world is not accessible to every one (asamâyi); for only a certain one (by performing properly the sacrifices) meets there (tbe previous occupants). Therefore, when the other hymns are repeated together with the Dûrohaņas, then he (the priest) would make all equal (make all those who sacrifice and those who do not sacrifice go to heaven). Not to repeat these other hymus along with the Darohaņas is a characteristic of the heaven-world (the celestial world being accessible to but few). Therefore, one ought not to repeat them. . [422] That is the reason that he does not repeat them. (Should be do so, he would destroy the sacrificer); for the singing verse (Stotriya) is his soul, and the Valakhilyas are his breath. When he repeats (the Ahîna hymns) along (with the Darohana) then he takes away the life of the sacrificer through those two deities (Indra-Varuņa, to whom the Dû robana belongs.) (If one should observe a Hotri-priest doing so), one ought to tell the priest that he has deprived the sacrificer of his vital airs through those two deities (who get angry at it), and that he will lose his life. And thus it always happens. Thence he ought not to repeat (them). 

If the Maitrâvaruņa should think, "I have repeated the Vâlakhilyas (which was a very arduous task), well, I will now repeat before the Důra hana the Ekâha hymns,"24 he should not entertain such a thought (for it is useless). But, however, should be pride himself too much of his skill, that he would be able to repeat after the Dürohana (the repetition of which is very difficult) is over, many hundred mantras, he may do so for gratifying that desire alone which is (to be gratified by repeating many mantras). He then obtains what he was wishing to obtain by repeating many man tras. He would, however, do better not to recite them. For the Valakhilyas 

3Sastram of the Maitråvarupa is to be understood. ** Theso are, charsanidhritam (3, 51), and â vin rájänâu (7, 84). 

288 

belong to Indra; in them there are pâdas of twelve feet25 and every wish to be gratified by an Indra hymn in the Jagatî metre, is contained therein (therefore no other Indra hymn is required). (428) (Another reason that he had better not recite them) is the Indra Varuņa hymn (of the Dûrobana), and the Indra-Varuna (Yajya) which con cludes (for these represent a firm footing, of which the sacrificer might be deprived, when repeating hymns which serve for connecting the several days). 

They say, The Sastra must always correspond with the Stotra. Now the Vâlakhilyas being repeated by mixing verses of two hymns (vihrita) are then the Stotras to be treated in the same way or not? The answer is, There is such a mixing in the Stotra), a pâda of twelve syllables being joined to one of eight.89 

They say, The Yâjys must correspond with the Sastra. If in (the Sastra) there are three deities, viz. Agni, Indra, and Varuņa mentioned, how does he make the Yâjyâ with a verse addressed to Indra-Varuņa alone, and omit Agni ? (The answer is) Agni and Varuna are one and the same being. So said a Rişi in the mantra, “Thou Agni! art born as Varuņa" (5, 3, 1). If he therefore makes his Yâjyâ with an Indra Varuņa mantra, then Agni is not left out.

FIFTH CHAPTER. (The so-called Silpas, viz. the Nâbhânediştha, Nardsansa, Dalakhil ya, Sukirti, Vrişâkapi, and Evayâmarut hymns. The Kuntapa Sastra.) 

27. (The Nábhânediştha and Narasamsa hymns repeated by the Hotar) 

They repeat the Silpas (hymns for producing [424] wonderful pieces of art). There are such wonder-works of the gods, and the arts in this world are to be understood as an imitation thereof. The gilded cloth spread over an elephant, the carriage to which a mule is yoked, are such a wonder-work. This work is understood in this world by him, who has such a knowledge. The Silpas make ready the soul, and imbue it with the knowledge of the sacred hymns. By means of them the Hotri-priest prepares the soul for the sacrificer. 

** Some of the Valakhilyas are in the Pragatha metre, which consists of two strophes, called Brihati and Satobrihati. In the first the third pâda comprises twelve syllables, and in the second the first and third contain as many. Twelve syllables four times taken con stitute the Jagati metre. Thenco the author supposes the Jagatî metre to be contained in " the Valakbilyas. 

Bo The Stotra alluded to is, agne tvar no antaman (5, 24, 1) which is a Dvipada, the first pâda comprising eight, the second twelve feet. 

-0.1 

He repeats the Nubhanediştha hymn (one of the Silpas). For Nâbhânedistha is the sperm. In such a way he (the priest) effuses the sperm. He praises him Nâbhânediştha) without mentioning his name. For the semen is like something unspeakable secretly poured forth into the womb. The sperm becomes blended. For when Prajapati had carnal intercourse with his daughter, his sperm was poured forth upon the earth (and was mixed up with it):" This was done for making the sperm produce fruit. 

He then repeats the Narâšamsa,» for narah means "offspring," and sansah "speech." In this way he (the priest) places speech into children (when they are born.) Thence chidren are born endowed with the faculty of speech. 

Some repeat the Narâdamsa before (the Nâbhânediştha,) saying, Speech has its place in the front (of the body ; others repeat it after (the Nâbhânediştha), saying, Speech has its place behind (in the binder part of the head). He shall recite it in the middle ; for speech has its place in the middle (of (425] the body). But speech being always, as it were, nearer to the latter part of the Nâbhânediştha bymn), the Narasamsa must be repeated before the Nábhånediştha is finished)s 

The Hotar having effused the sacrificer in the shape of sperm (symbo lically), gives him up to the Maitrå varuņa, saying, "form his breaths." 

28. (The Valakhilyas repeated by the Maitrăvâruna.) He (the Maitrâvaruņa) nov repeats the Valakhilyas. For the Vâla khilyas are the breaths. In this way he forms the breaths of the sacrifi cer. He repeats them by mixing two verses together. For these breaths are mutually mixed together, with the Prâņa the Apâna, and with the Apâna the Vyana. The two first hymns are repeated pâda by pâda ; the second set (third and fourth) half verse by half verse, and the third set (Gfth and sixth) verse by verse. By repeating the first set; he makes the breath and speech. By repeating the second set, he makes the eye and mind. By repeating the third set, he makes the ear and soul. Some take, 

1 This is wantioned in the fifth verse of the Nabhanediştha bymn (10, 61), Prajâpati's intercourse with his daughter is alluded to in this hymn. 

This is called the second Nábhanediştha hymy (10, 62), beginning ye yajsiena. There the birth of the Angiras is spoken of. 

3 The Nábbânedistha hymn, idam itthâ rondran (10, 61) consists of twenty-seven verses; after the twenty-fifth verse is finished, the following Narasanisa hymn is repeated. Repeater of both the Nibhänedistha and Narâšamsa hymns is the Hotar, 

* The six first Valakhilya hymns are repeated in three sets, each comprising two hymns, see page 419, 

11 

when repeating these Válakhilya Pragathas, always to Bribatis, and tio Satobribatis together. Though the wish obtainable by mixing the verses is obtained by this way of recital, yet no Pragåthas: are thus formed. 

[428] He must repeat them hy inserting an additional pâda ;8 then. thus are the Pragathas formed. The Vâlakhilya verses are the Pragathas. Therefore he must repeat them by inserting a pâda (in order to obtain the Pragâtba metre). The Brihatî of the Pragatha is the soul, the Satobri hati the life. If he has repeated the Brihati, then the soul, (is made) ; and if he has repeated the Satobrihati, the vital airs (are made). By thus repeating the Brihati and the Satobribatî, he surrounds the soul with the vital airs. Therefore he must repeat the Valakhilyas in such a way as to obtain the Pragatha metre. The BỊihati is the soul, and the Sato brihati cattle. If he has repeated the BỊihatî, then the soul (is made); and if he has repeated the Satobțibati, then cattle (is made). By repeating both he surrounds the soul with cattle. The two last hymns are repeated in an inverted order (first the eighth and then the seventh.) 

The Maitrâvaruņa after having made in this way the rital airs of the sacrificer, hands him over to the Brâhmanâchchhamsi, saying, "create him now (in the human form)." 

. 29 (The Sukirti and Vrışdkapi hymns repeated by the Brahmanâchhamsi.) 

The Brâhmaņâchchhařsi repeats the Sukirti hymn;' for the Sukirti is the womb of the gods. He thus causes the sacrificer to be born out of the sacrifice, which is the womb of the gods. 

He repeats the Vrişåkapi hymns For Vrişâ kapi is the soul. In this way he makes the soul of [427] the sacrificer. He repeats it with Nyünkha. The Nyankba is food. In this way he provides him when born with food, just as a mother) gives the breast to her child. That hymn is in the Pankti i.e. five-hood) metre; for man consists of five parts, viz. hair, skin, flesh, bones and marrow. He prepares the sacrificer just in the same way, as man (in general) is prepared. 

The Brāhmaṇachchhamsi, after having created the sacrificer, hands him over to the Achchhâvaka, saying, "make a footing for him." 

herkese 

o The form required for the Pragatha metre is the combination of the Brihatî with the Satobrihatî. If two Bribatîs are taken together, no Pragatha is formed, nor if two Sato brihatîs are joined, 

• See above page 410. This is called Atimarsa. * This is the hymn, apa prâcha (10, 131). It is repeated by the Brâhmanachchhamsi. $ This is the hymn vihi sotor (10, 86.) 

· This Nyankha differs somewhat from the usual way of making it. The sound is attered sixteen times, three times with three moras, and thirteen times with half moras See Asyal. Sr. S. 8,3,

(The Evayámarut repeated by the AchchhúrákaStory of Bulila) 

The Achchhâvâka now repeats the Evayâmarut hymn, This hymn is the footing; by repeating it the Achchhârâka makes a footing to the sacrificer. He repeats it with Nyûhkha. The Nyünkba is food. Thus be provides the sacrificer with food. In this hymn there is the Jagati and Atijagatî metre, which metres comprise the whole universe what falls in the sphere of movable things as well as what falls beyond it. It is addressed to the Marutas. The Marutas are the waters; and water is food which is to be filled (in the sacrificer like water in a pot). In this way he provides the sacrificer with food. 

The Nâbhânediştha, Valakhilyas, Vạişâ kapi, and Evayâmaruta are called "auxiliary hymns." The priest ought to recite them (all) along with (the other hymns); (if he does not like that) he ought not to repeat any (of them along with the other hymns). (428] But if he should repeat them on different days or occasions) it is just as if one would separate a man from his sperm. Thence he ought either to repeat them along with (the other hymns) or omit them entirely. 

That (famous) Bulila, the son of Ašvâtara, the son of Aśra, being once Hotar at the Visvajit sacrifice, speculated about ibis matter, that is to say, these Silpas (these auxiliary bymns). He thought, " There having been added two Sastras that of the Maiträvaruņa and that of the Brabranâchchhainsi) to the midday libation in the Visvajit of the sacri ficial sessions for a year, I thus (in further addition) will repeat the Evayảmaruta.” Thus he recited it. Whilst be was repeating it Gausla came near him, and said, “ Hotar! Why does thy Sastra proceed with out wheels? How bas it come (that thou art acting in such a way)?” The Evayâmaruta is repeated by the Achchlâvâka standing north from the Hotar. He further said, " The midday libation belongs to Indra. Wby Jost thou wish to turn out Indra from it?" He answered, "I do not wish to turn out Indra from the midday libation,” He said, (Yes, you do), for this particular metre being the Jagati and Atijagati is not fit for the midday libation, 1) and the bymu is besides addressed to the Marutas (not to Iudra, as it should be) ; therefore one should not repeat it now. Bulila then said, “Stop, Achhâvâka, I wish to carry out Gausla's order.", Gausla then said, " He shall repeat an Indra bymn, in which

the mark of Vişņu is impressed.' Thence thou, Hotar, shalt leave [429] out from thy Sastra this Evayâmarula, which was recited after the Rudra Dhâyyâ, and before the Maruta Sastra." He did so, and so they proceed now. 

81 Queries on some particulars of tłie application of these auxiliary hymns. Their meaning).' 

They ask, Why do they not repeat the Nâbhânediştha in the Visvajit, Atirâ tra, and on the sixth day of the Salaha, when they make the sacrifice complete and reproduce the sacrificer (in a mystical way), although the Maitrâvaruņa repeats the Vâlakhilyas which repre sent the breaths, but not the sperm (as the Nâbhânediştha does), whilst the sperm must precede the breaths (in the act of generation)? In the same way why does the Brâhmaņâchchhansi repeat the Vğişákapi when the Nâbhânediştha is not repeated ? For the Vrişâkapi is the soul, whilst the sperm represented by the Nabhânediştha hymn precedes the making of the soul. How then can the sacrificer be reproduced in this way? How can that be effected, if his life is not formed (by the act of genera tion)? For the priests produce the sacrificer (make him anew) by means of the sacrificial process. Therefore the whole being of the sacrificer cannot be made at once at the beginning, but just as an embryo which, lying in the womb, developes itself (grows gradually). If h has all limbs (only then he is entire). The priests should make them all on the same day. If thus the sacrifice is made ready, then the re production of the sacrificer is effected. 

The Hotar repeats, the Evayâmarut at the third libation. For this is the sacrificer's footing on which the Hotar places him at the end.

11 The so-called Kuntâpa hymns are to be repeated by the Brühmanachchhnisi after he has finished the Vrişå kapi. Their repctition has several peculiarities regarding the response, which all are noted by Asval. sc. S, (8, 3). The response for the first 14 verses beginning with idari jana upa sruta is at the end of cach verse only, it is simply othramo daivom, The verses which immediately follow up to eid asvif á plavanta have two

juice of the metres might go away and run over the worlds. Therefore he kept it down by means of metres placed on another part (above tbem). With the Narasarsi be kept down (the juice) of the Gâyatri, with the Raibhi that of the Triştubb, with the Párikşiti that of the Jagatis, with the Kâravyâ that of the Anuş [481] ţubhs. Thus he provided again the metres with good juice. The sacrifice of him who has this knowledge becomes performed with metres keeping their juice, and he spreads it with metres keeping their juice, (i.e., the essence of the sacrifice is not lost). 

The priest now repeats Naraśarisi verses.* For narah (men) means children and sainsal speech. He thus places speech in children. Therefore children of him who has this knowledge are born with the faculty of speaking The Gods and Rişis having gained the heavenly world by repeating the Narâšansa Terses, the sacrificers who repeat them go to the heavenly world also. The priest stops when repeating these versos, after each of the two or three first pâdas, and after the two or three last taken together," 5 just as he does when repeating the Vţişå kapi. For what is of the same nature as the Vrişå kapi (as the Naràsaisis are 

responses each, after every half verse. The seventy pâdas commencing with eta asva have each a response. The six verses commencing with vitatâu Kirandu have eaclia “peculiar response after the first half verse. So the response to vitatáu is dundubhim

Tor the responso (pratigara) is repeated by the Adhyaryu. Similar responses occur in all verses which follow as far as the dcvanitizam, üdityalia naritar ; they all are given in the Atharvaveda, such as pipilakívatal, suci, parasadali, &c., which all aro followed by jaritar othâmo daivon. In the Devanitha (Athar. 20, 135. 6-10) the response is in the first pada of each verso ; it is or lice jaritar otlámo daiva, "These Kuntapa songs do not boar a strictly religious character ; they are praise songs, principally referring to Dakşiņa and belong to that class of ancient poetry which bears the name narásariisi. This may be clearly seen from the commencenient of tho whole collection, idan janci u pasruta nárosainsalu, tavisyate, i.C., hearken ye people to this: Narasa zisah will be praised with chants. The recitation of these pieces is accom panied with musical instruments, such as dundubhi, karkari, &c. The repoater must have been originally the chanter; for in the response ho is always addressed by "jaritar," i. 7, singer.

16 This is a translation of the term pragraha. Several of the versos arc in the Pankti metre : thon the three last pâdas are taken together. As far as this goes, they are just recited as the Vrişâkapi hymn. Only the Nyûähka is not made, but instead of it the Nioarda, which is a substituto for it. This poculiar pronunciation of the vowel takes place in tho socond syllable of the third, and the fourth of the fourth pada. The Pratigara is mzadethama daivom othanno daivom.

supposed to be) follows the same rule. In repeating them, he shall not make Nyûåkha, 26 but pronounce them with a kind of [482] Ninarda, 17 

for this is the Nyûókha of the Narâšamsis verses. 

The priest repeats the Raibhi verses. 18 For the Gods and Risis went by making a great noise (rebhantan) to the celestial world; in the same way, therefore, the sacrificers go to the celestial world. The recital is just the same as that of the Narâšinsis, and subject to the same rules.) 

He repeats tlie Pârikşiti verses.9 For Agni is the dweller round about (pariksit); he lives round the people, and the people live round (pa riksi) him. He who has such a knowledge, obtains union with Agni, and shares the same character and abode with him. As to these Pârikşiti verses (they may have another meaning too. For the year is Parikşit (dwelling round about); for it dwells round about men, and men dwell round about the year. Therefore he who has this knowledge, obtains union with the year(samvatsara) and shares its character and abode. (The Pârikşiti verses are repeated in the same way as the Narâšamsih.) 

He repeats the Kâraryd verses. 20 For any work of the gods crowned with success was performed by means of the Kåravyâs ; and the same is then the case with the sacrificers. The recital is the same as that of the Narâšamsih.) 

The priest now repeats the " directions forming verses" (disam klriptis). For in this way he [433] forms the directions. He repeats five such verses ; for there are five directions, viz , the four points (east, west, south and north) 

18 la repeating the Vrişâ kapi hyan, both tho Nyûukua and Ninarda arc used. The Nyunkla takes placo at the second syllablo of the third pada, which is the proper place for the Ninarda also. (On tho Nyünkha sec pago 322). The Ninarda is described by Ašval. Sr. S. 7, 11, as follows : olcůras chaturninarda udattan prathamottamau aruditta vitasá uttaro siludattatarul plutali prathamo akcîrünta utlamali, in c, tLc Towol o bas four times the Ninarda sound; the first and last times it has thoudatta accont, the two othors the anudatta; lhe latter of wliich has even tho anudatlatara (lowest arudatta); tho ürst (and last) is pronounced with thrco moras. There is another way of making tho Ninard by pronouncing tho o successively first with tho udatta, then with the anuditta, thon will the svarita, and lastly with tho udátta accent again. 

11 Nivîva is to bo parsed ni vi iva, the ni and vi belonging to tlo vorb nardet. Tuo whole ucans, literally, he ought to wako a poculiar spocies of the Ninarda, as it worc.

and one direction abore crossing (them all). Fle ought not to repeat (these Verses) with Nyaikha, nor make the Ninarda in the same way as above. Thinking, I will not mutilate (1790nkhayâni) ?? these directions, le repeats those verses, half rerse by hall verse. 

For making a footing, he then repeats the Janakalpi verses. a: For children are janakalpa (production of men). Ilaring made the directions in the above manner, he places people in them. He shall not repeat these verses with Nyûäkha, nor with the Ninarda, but just in the same way and for the same reasons as the disam klripti. 

He repeats the Indra-gåthâs. * For by means of the Indra songs, the Devas sang the Asuras down and defeated them. In the same way, the sacrificers put down their enemies by these songs. They are repeated, half verse by half verse, to obtain a footing for the sacrificer. 

38. (Aitasa-pralápa. The Pravahlika. A jijâsenya Praliridha, and 

Atirada Verses.) 

The priest (Brâhmapâchhamsi) repeats the Aitaśapralápa. Aitaša was a Muni. He saw the mantras, called “ the life of Agui” (agner dyuh), which should remove all defects from the sacrifice, as some say. He said to his sons, "O my dear sons, I sawv 'the life of Agni ; ' I will talk about it; but pray do not scorn at me for anything I might speak. He then commenced to repeat, eta aśvâ âplavante, prattpam (434] prâti sutranam (A. V. 20, 129, 1 et seq.).35 Then one of his family, Ablyagni by name, went to him at an improper time (before Aitasa had finished his talk) and stopped his mouth by putting his hand on it, saying, "Our father has become mad.” Then his father said to him, “Go away, become infected with leprosy, thou who hast murdered my speech. I would be able to prolong the life of a cow to a hundred, and that of a man to a thousand years (if thou vrouldst not hare stopped my mouth), but thou, niy son, who hast overpowered me (in such an improper way), I curse : thy progepy shall come into the condition of the lowest among the most wicked." Therefore they say, that among the Aitasayanas the Abhyagnis are most burdened with sins, in the whole Aurva-Gotra (to which they belong). Some priests lengthen this Aitasa-pralapa (repeating eighteen 

22 From ukh, unkn, to more, go. 28 Yo naktákso anablyakto, A. V. 20, 128, 6-11. 24 Yad indrado dasarajñe, A. V. 20, 128, 12-16. 15 According to Sâyana, the Aitasa-pralåpa consists of 70 pâdas, 

296 

more pâdas). (If they choose to do so) one should not prevent them ; but say, "repeat as long as you like. For the Aitasa-pralậpa is life.” There fore, he who has this knowledge, prolongs in this way the life of the sacrificer. 

As to the Aitasa-pralậpa, there is another meaning in it. For it is the essence (juice) of the metres ; by repeating it, the reciter puts speech in the metres. He who has this knowledge, will keep the essence in the metres, when the sacrifice is performed, and will spread the sacrifice with the essence in the metres. 

But there is still another meaning in the Aitasa-pralâ pa ; it is fit for removing defects in the sacrifice, and for restoring its entirety. For the Aitasa-pralâpa is imperishableness. (Therefore when it is recited, the sa crificer wishes) "May my sacrifice be lasting and all its defects be removed,” He repeats (435) this Aitasa-pralâpa , stopping after every pâda, just as the Nivid is repeated ; at the last pâda he; pronounces on," just as it is done in the Nivid. 

He repeats the Prävahlika verses. 28 For the gods made the Asuras benumbed (pravahlya) by means of the Pravahlikâs, and, consequently, defeated them. In the same way, the sacrificers benumb and defeat their enemies by repeating these verses. They are repeated, half verse by half verse for obtaining a footing. 

Je repeats the Ajijñasenya verses. * ? Tor, by means of these verses, the Deras recognised (Âjñaya) the Asuras and defeated them. In the same way, the sacrificers recognise and defeat their enemies. They are repeated half verse by half verse. 

He now repeats the Pratirâdha .es For, by means of it, the Devas frustrated (prati-radh) the efforts of the Asuras, and consequently defeated them. The same effect is produced by the sacrificers who have repeated it. 

He repeats the Ativada.a, Tor, by means of it, the Devas abused (ativad) the Asuras so much as to defeat them. The same effect is produced by the sacrificers who repeat it. They are repeated, half verse by half verse, for obtaining a footing.

34 (Story of the Sacrifices of the Adityas and Angirasus for reaching Leaven.) 

He repeats the Devanîithram,'(About this, the following story is reported.) The Aditiyas and Angirasas (488) Ivere contending with one another as to who should gain first the heavenly world. The Angirasas had seen in their mind) that, by dint of the Soma sacrifice they were about to bring on the next day, they would be raised to heaven first, They therefore despatched one from among themselres, Agni by name, instructing him thus: “Go to the Âdityas and announce to them that we shall, by dint of our to-morrow's Soma sacrifice, go to heaven." As soon as the Adityas got sight of Agni, they at once saw in their minds) the Soma sacrifice by which they would reach heaven. Having come near them, Agni said, “We inform you of our bringing to-morrow that Soma sacrifice, by means of which we shall reach heaven." They answered, “And we announce to you that we are just now contemplating to bring that Soma sacrifice, by means of vbicl re shall reach heaven; but thou (Agni) must serve as our Hotar, then tre shall go to heaven. He said, “Yes," (and went back to the Angiras). After having told (the Angiras the message of the Adityas) and received their reply, he went back to the Adityas). They asked him, “ Hast thou told our message ?" He said, “Yes, I have told it (to the Abgiras); and they answered, and asked, 

Did'st thou not promise us thy assistance (as a Hotar',' and I said, 'Yes, I have promised.' (But I could not decline the offer of the Adityas). For he who engages in performing the duty of a sacrificial priest, obtains fame; and any one who prevents the sacrifice from being performed, excludes himself from his fame. Therefore I did not prevent (by declining the offer)." If one wishes to decline serving as a sacrificial priest, then this resfusal is only justified on account of oneself being engaged in a sacrifice, or because of being legally prohibited to perform the sacrificial duties. 

35 

1437] On the Dakşiņá giren by the Adityas to the Angirasas. The 

Deunítha Hymn.) The Angirasas, therefore, assisted the Adityas in their saciifice. For this service, the Adityas gave them the earth filled with presents (dakşina) as reward. But when they had accepted her, she burnt them. Therefore they fluog ber away. She then became a lioness, and, opening her 

*9 Aditya lua jaritar angirovliyo, A. V, 20, 185, 6 et seq* 17 verses, according to Sây. 

298 

lear 

inouth, attacked people. From this burning state of the earth came those ruptures which are now visible on her), whereas she had been. previously quite even." Thence one shall not retake a sacrificial reward which one has once refused to accept. (For he must think) the Daksina being penetrated by a flame, shall not penetrate me with it. But should he take it back, then he may give it to his adversary and eneiny, who will be defeated, for it burns him, 

That (Aditya, the sun) then assuming the shape of a white horse with bridle and harness, presented himself to the other Âdityas, who said, “Let us carry this gift to you (the Angirasas)." Therefore this Devanitha, 2.e., what is carried by the gods, is to be recited. 

(Now follows the Devanitha, with Explanatory Remarks.) i “The Âdityas, O singer! brought the Angirasas their reward. The Angirasas, O singer, did not go near," i.e., they did not go near to that first gift (the earth). 

"But; O singer ! (afterwards) they went near it," i.e., illey went near the other gift (the white horse). 

(438] " They did not accept it, o singer," 2.0., they did not accept this earth. " But they accepted it," i.e., they accepted that white horse. 

"He (Aditya, the sun), being carried away, ** the days disappeared;" for he (the sun) makes the days visible. 

“He being carried away, the wise men were without a leader (pulfo gava)." For the reward (Dakşiņa) is the leader in the sacrifices. Just as a carriage without having a bullock as a leader yoked to it, becomes damaged, a sacrifice at which no reward (Dakşiņâ) is given, becomes damaged also. Therefore, the sacrificial reward must be given (to the perforiners of a sacrifice), and even if it should be but very little (on account of the poverty of the sacrificer). 

“ And, further, this horse is white, with quickly running feet, the swiftest (of all). He quickly discharges the duties incumbent on him. Tho Adityas, Rudras and Vasavas praise (lim). Accept, therefore, this gift, O Angiras !” They now inteuded accepting this gift. 

5: IIere we have an attempt to explain the unevenness of the earth. It is interestivg to see the theories of modern geology foreshadowed in this certainly ancient myth. 

12 Instead of neta sann, which reading is to be found here, as well as in the Atharvaveda, petak sann must be read; nea tłu, then, is an irregular form of the past part, of ni, to carry, standing for nita. 

299 

“This gift is large and splendid. This present which the gods have given, shall be your illuminator. It shall be with you every day. Thence consent to accept it!" (After having beard these words) the Angiras accepted the reward. 

In reciting this Devanitha, the priest stops at every pâda, just as is done when the Nivid is repeated, and pronounces "on" at the last pâda, just as is the case with the Nivid. 

36, (439) (Bhúte-chhad, Ahanasya, Dadhikravart, Paramánya, and the 

Indra Brihaspati Verses) He now repeats the Bhúte-chhad 's (dazzling porrer) verses. By means of these verses, the Devas aproached the Asuras by fighting and cunning. For, by means of them, they dazzled the power of the Asuras, and consequently overcame them. In the same way, the sacrificer who repeats these verses, overcomes his enemy. They are repeated half verse by hall verse, to obtain a footing. 

He now repeats the Ahanasyn 3* verses. For the sperm is poured forth from the Ahanasya (penis); and from the sperm creatures are born. In this way, the priest males offspring (to the sacrificer). These verses are ten in number; for the Viraj has ten syllables, and the Viraj is food ; from food the spern (is produced) and can (consequently) be poured forth, and from sperm creatures are produced. He repeats them with Nyankha; for this is food. 

He now repeats the Dadhikrivan verse, dadhikrävano akârsiham (Atharv. V. 20, 137, 3). For the Dadhikra is the purifier of the gods. For le (the priest) spoke such (words98) as are to be regarded as the speech containing the most excellent semen.** By means of this purifier of the gods, he purifies speech (rich). The verse is in the Anuşțnbh metre; for Vâch is Anuştubh, and thus she becomes purified by her own metre. 

He now repeats the Pavamânya verses, suláso madhumatama (9, 101,4); for the Påvamânyas (purification verses) are the purification of the gods. For he spoke such (words) as are to be regarded as the speech containing the most excellent semen. By means of this purifier of the gods, he purifies speech. They are Anustubhs; for the Vach" is Anuştubh, and thus she becomes purified by her own metre.

For the Asura nation, when they had marched out to fight against the Deras. Tras everywhere subjugated by Indra with the assistance of Brihaspati, and driven away.

Now follows the division of the different parts of the sacrificial animal (among the priests). We shall describe it? The tsvo jawbones with the tongue are to be given to the Prastotar; the breast in the form of an eagle to the Udgåtar; the throat with the palate to the Pratibartar; the lower part of the right loins the Hotar; the left to the Brahmâ ; the right thigh to the Maitrâ varuna; the left to the Brahmapachhańsí; the right side with the shoulder to the Adhvaryu; the left side to those who accompany the chants; * the left shoulder to the Pratipasthậtar; the lower part of the right arm to the Nestar; the lower part of the left arm to the Potar; the upper part of the right thigh to the Achhavâka; the left to the Agnidbra; the upper part of the right arm to Atreya ; the left to the Sadasya; the back bone (442) and the urinal bladder to the Grihapati (sacrificer); the right feet to the Gțihapati who gives a feasting; the left feet to the wife of that Gribapati who gives a feasting; the upper lip is common to both (the Grihapati and bis wife), which is to be divided by the Grihapati. They offer the tail of the animal to wives, but they should give it to a Brahmana; the fleshy processes (manikah) on the neck and three gristles (kakasah) to the Grâvastut; three 

* The same piece is found in Asv. ér. S. 12, 4. 

2 The Upagâ tris accompany the chant of the Sama singers with certain syllables which correspond to the Pratigâra of the Adhrargu This accompaniment is called ?paganam. It differs according to the different Sâmans. At the Bahiş-pavamina Stotra at the morning libation, the rtpagánarni of the Tpagâtris is ho. Besides, the sacrificer has to make an apagánam also. This is om at the bahiş-payamâna Stotra. 

* The Atreya who is here mentioned as a receiver of a share in the sacrificial apimal, is no officiating priest Butithe circumstance that he receives gold for his Daksiņâ, and that it is given to him before the other priests (save the Agnîdhra), as we learn from the Kâtîya Srauta Sutras 10,2,21 shows, that he had a certain right to a principal share in all sacrificial donations. Atreya, meaning only a descendant of the Atrigotry, the right appears to have been hereditary in the family of the ancient Rişi Atri,other gristles and one-half of the fleshy part on the back (vaikurtta 4) to the Unnetar; the other half of the fleshy part on the neck and the left lobe (kloma ) to the slaughterer, who should present it to a Brahmana, if he himself would not happen to be a Brahmana. The head is to be given to the Subrahmnya), the skin belongs to him (the Subrahmanya), who spoke, sva) sutyam (to-morrow at the Soma sacrifice); that part of the sacrificial animal at a Soma sacrifice which belongs to Ila (sacrificial food) is common to all the priests; only for the Hotar it is optional. 

All these portions of the sacrifical animal amount to thirty-six single pieces, each of which represents the pâda (foot) of a verse by which the sacrifice is carried up. The Brihati metre consists of thirty-six syllables ; and the heavenly worlds are of the Brihati nature. In this way (by dividing the animal into thirty-six parts), they gain life (in this morld) and the heavens, and having become established in both (this and that world), they walk there. 

[443] To those who divide the sacrificial animal in the way mentioned, it becomes the guide to heaven. But those who make the division otherwise, are like scoundrels and miscreants who kill an animal merely (for gratifying their lust after flesh). 

This division of the sacrificial animal was invented by the Rişi Devabhiga, a son of Sruta.? When he was departing from this life, lie did not entrust the secret to any one). But a supernatural being com- - municated it to Girija, the son of Babhru. Since his time, men study

Either one shall then sacrifice the milk of a cow to which another (as its oito) call liad been brought (to rear it up), for the milk of such a cow is as different as the oblation brought in the name of an Agnihotri deceased. Or, they may offer the milk of any other cow. But they mention another way besides. (The relatives of the deceased Agnihotri) should keep burn ing the three) constantly blazing fires (Ahavaniya, &c.) without giviug them any offering till the ashes of the deceased shall have been collected. Should they not be fortlicoming, then they should take three hundred and sixty footstalks of Palasa leaves and form of them a human figure, and perform in it all the funeral ceremonies required ávrt). After having brought the members of this artificial corpse into contact with the three sacred fires, they shall remove (extinguish) them. They shall inake this human (445) figure in the following way: one hundred and Gifty footstalks are to represent the trunk of the corpse, one hundred and forty both the thighs, and fifty both the loins, and the rest are instead of the bead, and are therefore to be placed accordingly. This is the penance. 

Sanyia is the technical term for a certain offering of the Agnihotris. It is pre pared in the following way: The Adhvaryu takes the milk from three cows, called Ganga, Yamundi and Sarasvalt, on the morning and evening, and gives it to the Agpîdhra. Hali the mik is first drawn from the udder of each of the three cows under the recital of man tras ; then the same is done silently (tagnin). The milk is taken from these cows on the evening of the New Moon day, and on the morning of the following day, the so-called Pratipad (the Ürst day of the month). The milk drawn on the evening is made hot, and lime-juice poured over it, to make it sour, whereupon it is hung up. The fresh milk of the following morning is then mixed with it, and both are sacrificed along with the Purodása. Only he who has already performed the Agniştoma, is allowed to sacrifice the sänpayya at the Darsapurpima işti. (Oral information.)

They ask, If the Sânnâyya which was milked on the evening becomes spoiled or is lost (during the night), what is the penance for it? (The answer is) The Agnihotri shall divide the milk of the morning into two parts, and after having curdled ope part of it, he may offer it. This is the penance, 

They ask, If the Sânnâyya which was milked on the morning becomes spoiled or is lost, what is the penance ? (The answer is) He must prepare a Purođâda, for Indra and Mahendra, divide it instead of the milk, into the parts required, and then sacrifice it. This is the penance.

way (by means of the hot ashes), the offering becomes sacriticed and is not sacrificed. (It is of no cousequence) whether only one or two turps of the oblation (become spoiled); the penance for it is always performed in the way described.

May a third go to the air, to the Pitaras, as a sacrifice; might I s obtain thence wealth! May a third go to to the earth, to-men; might I "obtain thence wealth!" Then be mutters the Vişnu-Varuna verse, yayor ojasâ skabhita rajánsi (A. V. 7, 25, 11. For Vişnu watches over what is performed badly in the sacrifice, and Varuņa over that is performed well.

They ask, When the fire offering, after having been made ready, at the time when the Adhvaryu takes it eastward to the Ahvaniya fire (to sacrifice it), runs orer or is spilt altogether, what is the penance for it? (The Adhvaryu is not allowed to turn back his face). If he would turn his face backward, then he would turn the sacrificer from heaven. Therefore (some other men) must gather up for him when he is seated (having turned the face eastward) the remainder of the offering, which he then sacrifices just in its turn.' This is the penance for it. 

They ask, If the sacrificial spoon (sruch) should be broken, what is the peuance for it? He ought to take another Sruch and sacrifice with it. Then he shall throw the broken Sruch into the havaniya fire, the stick being in the front, and its cavity behind. This is the penance for it.

is The Säutramari (ixti) is a substitute for tho Soma sacrifice. Some spirituous liquor is taken instead of Soma, and milk. Both liquids are filled in the Soma vessels. It is verforned in various ways. It is mentioned, and its performance briefly described in LLO Ašval. Sr. S. 3, 9, and in the Kitîya Sotras (in the 19th Adhyaya). From three to four animals are immolated, one to the Ašvins, one to Sarasvati, one to Iudra, and one to Brihaspati, The Pasupurodása are for Indra, Savitar and Varuna. The Puronu vakya for the offering of the spirituous liquor is, yuvarit suraman asuince (10, 11, 4). Tuc Praişa for repeating the Vajyâ mantra is as follows :

Tho Diece may (to judge from its uncouth language) even be older than the bulk of the Aitarêyahaving (by her death) destroyed the qualification for the performance of (the daily) burnt offering?" 

They say, That one has children, grand-children, and relations in this world, and in that world. In this world, there is heaven (i. e., heaven is to be gained in this world by sacrificing). (The Agnihotri who [457] has no wife, says to his children, &c:) “I have ascended to heaven by means of what was no heaven (1. e., by the sacrifice performed in this world)." He who does not wish for a (second) wile (for having his sacifi cial ceremonies continuously performed), keeps thus (by speaking to his. children, &c., in the way indicated) his connection with the other world up. Thence they (his children) establish (new fires) for him who has lost his wife. 

How does he who has no wife, bring his oblations (with his mind) ? (The answer is) Faith is his wife, and Truth the sacrificer. The marriage of Faith and Truth is a most happy one. For by Faith and Truth joined, they conquer the celestial world,

(On the Different Names of the Full and New Moon.)

The purport of this paragtaph is to show, in what way an Aguihotri may continue his sacrificial career, though it be interrupted by the death of his wife.

He ought to make all the preparations on the first part of the New Moon day; this is the opinion of the Paingyas : he shall make them on the latter part; this is the opinion of the Kausitakis. The first part of the Full Moon day is called Anumati, to the latter Rákâ; the first (458) part of the New Moon day is called Sinivali, and its latter part Kuhit. The space which the moon requires for setting and rising again is called Tithi (lunar day). Without paying any attention íto the opinion of the Paingyas) to make the preparations on the first part of the Full Joon day, he brings his sacrifice when he meets (sees) the Moon (rising) on the New Moon day; "" on this (day) they buy the Soma. Therefore he must always make his preparations on the second part of either the Full or New Moon dars (i. e, on the days on which the moon enters into either phase). All days which follow, belong to Soma (the Soma sacrifice may be completed.) He brings the Soma sacrifice as far as the Soma is a deity; for the divine Soma is the moon. Therefore, he must make the preparations on the second part of that lunar day.

By means of this light (the silver), he overcomes death, which is the shadow of darkness. This is the penance. 

They ask, When a cart, or a carriage, or horses go over the Gârhapatya and Ahavanîya fires of an Agnihotri, what is the penance for it? He shall nut mind it at all, thus they say, believing that these things (their types) are placed in his soul. But should he mind it, then he shall form a line of vrater drops from the Gârhapatya, to the Ahavaniya under the recital of tantum tancam rajaso (10, 53 6). This is the penace. 

They ask, Shall the Agnihotri, when feeding the (other) fires with wood, make the Dakşiņa Agni (anvâhârya pachanad) also to blaze up brightly, or shall be not do so ? Who feeds the fires, puts into his soul the vital breaths; of these fires, the Dakşiņa Agni provides (the feeder) best with food. He gives him therefore an offeriug, saying, “lo Agni, the enjoyer of food, the master of food, Swahâ !" He who thus knows, becomes au enjoyer of food, and a master of food, and obtains children and food. 

The Agnibotri must walk between the Gârbapatya and Ahavaniya when be is about to sacrifice; for the Agnis (fires) when perceiving him walk thus, know, "he is about to bring us a sacrifice." By this both these fires destroy all wickedness of him who is thus walking (between them). Whose wickedness (460) is thus destroyed, goes up to the heavenly world. 

Thus it is declared in another Brâhmaṇam which they quote. 

They ask, How can an Agnihotri, who intends going abroad, be near his sacred fires (established at his home)? Can he do it when absent, or is le to return to them every day? Ele shall approach them silently in his mind, without repeating the mantras). For, by keeping silence, they aspire after fortune. But some say (he should go to them) every day. For the Agnis of an Agnihotri lose all confidence in him by bis absence, fearing lest they be removed or scattered. Therefore he must approach then, and, should be not be able to return, he must repeat the words, “May you be sale! may I be safe!" In this way, the Agnihotri is safe.

THIRD CHAPTER. (The Story of Sansepa) 

13 

(King Harischandra wishes for a Son. Stanzas praising the Possession 

of a Son). Harischandra, the son of Vedhas, of the Ilşvâku race, mas a king who had no son. Though he had a hundred wives, they did not give birth to a son. In his house there lived the Rişis, Parvata and Närada. Once the king addressed to Nârada (the following stanza): 

"Since all beings, those endolved with reason (men) as well as those who are without it (beasts) wish for a son, what is the fruit to be obtained by having a son? This tell me, O Narada?" 

Narada tbus addressed in one stanza, replied in the following) ten : 

1. The father pays a debt in his son, and gains immortality, when he beholds the face of a son liring who was born to him. 

2. The pleasure wbich a father has in his son, exceeds the enjoyment of all other beings, be they on the earth, or in the fire, or in the water. 

3. Fathers always orercome great difficulties through a son. (In him) the Self is born out of Self. The son is like a well-provisioned boat, which carries him over. 

4. "What is the use of living unwashed, wearing the goatskin," and beard *? What is the use of performing austerities? You should wish for a son, O Brahmans!” Thus people talk of them (who forego the married life on account of religious devotion). 

5. Tood preserves life, clothes protect from cold, gold (golden ornaments) gives. beauty, marriages produce wealth in cattle ;the wife is the friend, the daughter object of compassion, but the son shines as his light in the highest heaven. 

* Here the Grihastha is meant. * The Brahmachari is alluded. * The Vanaprustha, or hermit is to be understood. 

The Pariyråjaka, or religious mendicant is meant 

• Avadavadah, i. e., pronouncing a blame Sây. takes the word-in a different sense, “not deserving blame on account of being free from guilt." This explanation is artificial. 

"At certain kinds of marriages, the so-called Arşq (the Rişi marriage), a pair of cows was given as a dowry. See Aśval. Grihy, Sötr. 1, 8.

. 

6. The husband enters the wife (in the shape of seed), and, when the seed is changed to an embryo, he makes her mother, from whom, after having become regenerated, in her, he is born in the tenth month. 

7. His wife is only then a real wife (jâyd, from jan, to be born) when he is born in her again. The [462] seed which is placed in her, she developes to a being and sets it forth. 

8. The Gods and the Rişis endowed her with great beauty. The gods then told to men, this being is destined to produce you again. 

9. He who has no child, has no place (no firm footing). This even know the beasts. Thence the son cohabits (among beasts even) with his mother and sister. 

10. This is the broad, well-trodden path on which those who have sons walk free from sorrows. Beasts and birds know it; thence tbey cohabit (even) with their own mothers. 

Thus he told. 

14. (A Son is Born to Harischandra. Varuna repeatedly requests the King to 

sacrifice his son to him; but the Sacrifice is under different pretences always Put Off by the King.) 

Nârada then told him, “Go and beg of Varuņa, the king, that he might favour you with the birth of a son (promising him at the same time) to sacrifice to him this son when born." He went to Varuņa, the king, praying, “ Let a son be born to me; I will sacrifice him to thee," Then a son, Rohita by name, was born to him. Varuna said to him, “A son is born to thee, sacrifice him to me." Harischandra said, "An animal is fit for being sacrificed, when it is more than ten days old. Let him reach this age, then I will sacrifice him to thee." After Rohita had passed the age of ten days, Varuņa said to him, "He is now past ten days, sacrifice him to me." Harischandra answered, "An animal is fit for being sacrificed when its teeth come. Let his teeth come, then I will sacrifice [483] him to thee." After his teeth had come?, Varuņa said to Haris chandra, " His teeth have now come, sacrifice him to me." He answered, "An animal is fit for being sacrificed when its teeth fall out. Let his teeth fall out, then I will sacrifice him to thee." His teeth fell out. He then said, " TIis teeth are falling out, sacrifice him to me." He said, "An animal is fit for being sacrificed when its teeth have come again. Let his teeth come again, then I will sacrifice him to thee." His teeth 

* The words, ajnatavai and apatsat avãi, are a kind of infinitive.

317 

came again. Varuņa said, "His teeth have now come again, sacrifice him to me." He answered, " A man of the warrior caste is fit for being sacrificed only after having received his full armour. Let him receive his full armour, then I will sacrifice him to thee.” He then was invested with the armour. Varuņa then said, “He has now received the armour, sacrifice him to me.” After having thus spoken, he called his son, and told him, “Well, my dear, to him who gave thee unto me, I will sacrifice thee now." But the son said, 'No, no," took his bow and absconded to the wilderness, where he was roaming about for a year. 

15. (Continuation of this story. Rohita, Harischandra's Son, Purchases, after Six Years of fruitless Wanderings in the Forest, a Brahman boy, Sunalsepa by name, from his parents, to be sacrificed in his stead by Harischandra to Varuņa. Stanzas.) 

Varuna now seized Harischandra, and his belly sivelled (i. e., be was attacked by dropsy). When Rohita heard of it, he left the forest, and went to a village, where Indra in human disguise met him, and said to him, " There is no happiness for him who does not travel, Rohita ! thus we have heard. Living (464) in the society of men, the best man (often) becomes a sinner (by seduction, which is best avoided by wandering in places void of human dwellings) ; for Indra surely is the friend of the traveller. Therefore, wander!" 

Rohita thinking, a Brâliman told me to wander, wandered for a second year in the forest. When he was entering a village, after having left the forest, Indra met him in human disguise, and said to him. “ The feet of the wanderer are like the flower, his soul is growing and reaping the fruit; and all his sins are destroyed by his fatigues in wandering. Therefore, wander !" 

Robita thinking, a Brâhman told me to wander, wandered then a third year in the forest. When he was entering a village, after having left the forest, Indra met him in human disguise, and said to him, “The fortune of him who is sitting, sits; it rises when he rises; it sleeps when he sleeps ; it moves when he moves. Therefore, vander ! ” 

Rohita thinking, a Brálman told me to wander, vandered then a fourth year in the forest. When he was entering a village, after having left the forest, Indra said to him, " The Kali is lying on the ground, the Dvâpara is hovering there; the Tretâ is getting up, but the Kritą, 

318 

happens to talk (hither and thither). S Therefore, Tander, vander !" 

Rohita thinking, a Brâlman told me to wander, wandered for a filth year in the forest. When he was (465) entering a village, after having left the forest, Indra said to him, "The wanderer finds honey and the street. Udumbara fruit; behold the beauty of the sun, who is not trearied by his wanderings. Therefore, wander, wander!” 

Roliita then wandered for a sixth year in the forest. He met (this time) the Rişi Ajigarta, the son of Suyavasa, who was starving, in the forest. He had three sons, Sunampuchha, Surahsepa, and Sunolangúla. He told him, “Rişi! I give thee a hundred cows ; for I will ransom myself (from being sacrificed) with one of these (thy sons)." Ajigarta then excepted the oldest, saying, " Do not take him," and the mother excepted the youngest, saying, "Do not take him." Thus they agreed upon the middle one, Sunahścpa. He then gave for him a hundred cows, left the forest, entered the village, and brought him before his father, saying, “O my dear (father) ! by this boy I will ransom myself (from being sacrificed)." Ile then approached Varuna, the king (and said), "I will sacrifice him to theé!” He said, “Well, let it be done: for a Brâhman is worth more than a Kşattriya ! " Varuna then explained to the king the rites of the Râjasûya sacrifice, at which, on the day appointed for the inauguration (abhişechaniya), he replaced the (sacrificial animal) by a man. 

16. 

(The Sacrifice with the intended Human Victim comes off. Four Great Rişis were officiating as Priests. Sunahsepa prays to the Gods to be Released from the Fearful Death. The Hik verses which he used mentioned, and the different Deities to whom lie applied;. 

At this sacrifice, Visvâmitra was his Hotar, Jamadagni his Adhvaryu, Vasishtha his Bralimâ, and Ayasya his Udgâtar. After the preliminary cere (466) monies bad been performed, they could not find a person willing to bind him to the sacrificial post. Ajigarta, the son of Suyavasa, then 

A Sây. does not give any explanation of this important passage, where the names of the Yugas are mentioned for the first time. These four names are, as is well known from other sources (see the Sanscrit Dictionary by Boehtlingk and Roth, s. v. kali, dvcipara, &c.,) names of dice, used at gambling. The meaning of this Gatha is, There is every success to be hoped ; for the unluckiest die, the Kali, is lying, two others are slowly moving and kalf fallen, but the lackiest, the Krita, is in full motion. The position of dice given here is indicatory of a fair chance of winning the game.' ,

said, "Give me another hundred (cors), and I will bind him." They gave him another hundred, whereupon he bound lim. After be ball been bound, the Aprî verses recited, and the fire carried round binu, they could not find a slaughterer. Ajigaila then said, "Give me another hundred, and I will kill him." They gave him another hundred, He then whetted his knife and went to kill his son. Sunalisepa then got aware that they were going to butcher him just as if he weie no man (but a beast.) “Well” said he," I will seek shelter with the gods." He applied to Prajâpati, who is the first of the gods, with the veise, kiasja nzûram halamasya (1, 21, 1). Prajapati answered him, " Agni is the ncarest of the gods, go to him." He then applied to Agni, with the verse, agner vayam prathamasya amritârâm (1, 24, 2). Agni answered hin, “Savitar rules over the creatures, go to him." He then applied to Savitar with the three verses (1, 24, 3-5) beginning witb, alhi två dera Savitar. Savitar answered him, “Thou art bound for Varuņa, the King, go to him." He applied to Varuna with the following thirty-one verses (124, 0-25, 21). Varuna then answered him, " Agni is the mouth of the gods, and the most compassionate of them. Praise him not! then we shall release you." Ile then praised Agni vith twenty-two verses (1, 20, 1. = 27, 12). Agni then answered, “ Prasise the Visre Deras, then we shall release you.” He then praised the Viśve Devas with the verse (1,27,13), namo mahadbhyo namo arblakebhyo. The Viśve Devas answered, " Indra is the strongest, the most powerful, the most enduring, the most true of the 

(467) gods, who kuolys best bow to briog to an end anything. Praise him, then ive shall release you." Ile then praised Indra with the hymn (1, 29), yach chid dhi satya somapa, and with fifteen verses of the follow ing'one (1,:30, 1-15). Indra, who had become pleased with his praise, presented him with a golden carriage. This present he accepted with the verse, śaśvad indra (1, 30, 16). Indra then told him, “Praise the Asvios, then we shall release you." He then praised the Asvins, with the three verses which follow the abovementioned (1, 30, 17-19. The Afvins then answered, "Praise Uşas (Davo), then we shall release you." He then praised Uşâs with the three verses which follow the Asvin verses (1, 30, 20-22). As he repeated one veise after the other, the fetters (of Varuņa) were falling off, and the belly of Harischandra became smaller. And, after he had done repeating the last verse, (all) the fetters veie taken off, and Harischandra restored to health again,

Soma. Visvámitra Adopts him as his Son. Starzas.) 

The priests now said to Sunahsepa, " Thou art now only ours (thou art now a priest like us) ; take part in the performance of the particular ceremonies of this day (the abişechaniya )." He then saw (invented) the method of direct preparation of the Soma juice (añjal sava without in termediate fermentation) after it is squeezed, and carried it out under the recital of the four verses, yach chid dhi tvam grihe grihe (1,285-8). Then, by the verse, uchchhiştam chamvor (1, 28, 9), he brought it into the Droņakalasa." Then [468], after having been touched by Haris chandra, he sacrificed the Soma, under the recital of the four first verses (of the hymn, yatra gráva prithubudhna (1, 28, 1-4), which were accom panied by the formula Swaha. Then he brought the implements required for making the concluding ceremonies (avabhritha) of this sacrifice to the spot, and performed them under the recital of the two verses, tvar no agne Varunasyn (4, 1, 4-5). Then, after this ceremony was over, Sun aḥsepa summoned Harischandra to the Abayanîya fire,'' and recited the verse, Sunah chichchhepam niditam (5, 2, 7). 

Sunahsepa then approached the side of Visvamitra (and sat by bim). Ajîgarta, the son of Suyavasa, then said, "O Rişi! return me my son." He answered, "No, for the gods have presented (deva arasata) him to me." Since that time, be was Devarâta, Visvamitra's son. From him 

come the Kapileyas and Babhravas. Ajigarta further said, come, muu, we (tlıy mother and I myself) will call thee," and added, “Thou art known as the seer from Ajîgarta's family, as a descendant of the Angi rasah. Therefore, O Rişi, do not leave your ancestral home; return to me." Sunahsepa answered, “What is not found even in the hands of a Sûdra, one has seen in thy hand, the knife (to kill thy son); three hundred cows thou hast preferred to me, O Angiras !" Ajigarta then answered, "O my dear son! I repent of the bad deed I have committed ; I blot out this stain ! one hundred of the cows shall be thine !" 

Sunahsepa answered, “Who once might commit such a sin nay commit the same another time; thou art still not free from the brutality of a Sûdra, for thou hast committed a crime for

whicl no reconcilia- [469] lion exists” “Yes, irreconcileable (is this act)," interrupted Visvâmitra. 

Visvâmitra then said, "Fearful Tas Suyavasa's son (to look at) when he was standing ready to murder, holding the knife in his hand; do not become his son agnin; but enter my family as my son." Sunahsepa then said, "O prince, let us know, tell (us) how I, ag an Angirasah, can enter thy family as thy (adopted) son?" Visvậmitra answered, “Thou shalt be the first-born of my sons, and thy children the best. Thou shalt now enter on the possession of my divine heritage. I solemnly instal thiee to it" Sunahsepa then said, “When thy sons should agree to thy trish that I should enter thy family, Othou best of the Bharatas! then tell them for the sake of my own happiness to receive me friendly." Visvâmitra then addressed his sons as follovs: "Hear ye now, Madhu chhandah, Rişabha, Renu, Astaka, and all ye brothers, do not think 13 yourselves (entitled) to the right of primogeniture, which is (Sunah sepa's)." 

18 (On Visvumilru's Descendants How the Reciters of the Sunchsepa story 

ure to be Reramed by the King Stunsas On the Pratigarn for the Richas and Stanzas at this Occasion.) 

This Risi Visvâmitra bad a hundred sons, fifty of them were older than Madhuchhandas, and fifty were younger than lie. The older ones were not pleased with (the installation of Sunahdepa to the primogeni ture). Visvâmitra then pronounced against [470] them the curse, “ You shall have the lowest castes for your descendants." Therefore are many of the most degraded classes of men, the rabble for the most part, such as the Andhras, Pundrus, Sabaras, Palindas, and Matibas, descendants of Visvamitra. But Madhuchlandês, with the fifty younger sons, said, “What our father approves of, by that ive abide; we all accord to the (Sunahsepa) the first rank, and we will come after thee!” Visvâmitra, deligated (at this answer) then praised these sons with the following verses ; 

"Ye my sons will have abundance of cattle and children, for you have made me rich in children by consenting to my wish," 

19 I have parsed the word sthana as stha na. Il sthana is taken as a 2nd porson plural, as Max Müller (following Sâyana) does in his translation of the story of Sunahsepa (History of Ancient Sanscrit Literature, page 418), the passage is to be translated as follows: " and all you brothers that you are, think him to be entitled to the primogenitura,"322 

"Ye gong of Gâthi, blessed rith children, you all will be successful when headed by Devarata ; he will always) lead you on the path of 

truth." 

"This Devarâta, is your master (man); follor him, ye Kusikas! He will exercise the paternal rights over you as his heritage from me, and take possession of the sacred knowledge that we have." 

"All the true sons of Viśvamitra, the grandsons of Gâthi, who forth with stood with Devarâta, tere blessed with wealth for their orn Irelfaro and renown." 

* Devarata is called the Rişi who entered on two beritages, the royal dignity of Jahnû's house, and the divine knowledge of Gathi's stem."}$ 

This is the story of Sunahsepa contained in the stanzas which are be yond the number of the hundred Rik verses '4 (recited along with them). The Hotar (471] when sitting on a gold embroidered carpet, recites them to the king, after he has been sprinkled with the sacred water. The Adhraiynı who 'reapeats the responses sits likewise on a gold embroidered carpet. For gold is glory. This procures glory for the king (for whom these Gîthis are repeated). Om is the Adhvaryu's response to a Rich (repeated by the Hotar), and evam tatha (thus in this way it is) that to a Gatha (recited by thie Ilotar). For Om is divine (therefore applied to richas, fhich aro a divine revelation), and tathe human. By means of the divine (om) and human (tatha) responses, the Adhvaryu makes the king free from sin an fault. Therefore any king who might be a conqueror (and consequently by shedding blood a sinner), although he might not bring a sacrifice, should have told the story of Sunahsepa. (If he do so) then not the slightest trace of sin (and its consequences) will remain in him. lle must gire a thousand cows to the teller of this story, and a hundred to him in makes the responses (required); and to each of them the (goll embroilorect) carpet on which he was sitting ; to the ITotar, besides, a silver dockou carriage drawn by mules. Those who wish for children, should also havo told this story ; then they certainly will be blessed with children, 

13 Jahrû is the ancestor of Ajigarta, and Gâthi the father of Visyâmitra. 

** Sây, says that ninety-seven out of them had been seen by Sunahspea and three by another Rişi. The term pararik-sata gåthum akhyanam means, the "story whick contains besides one hunsired Rik verses Gathas (stanzas) algo." The ?mmhor of the latter is thirty-one.

FOURTH CHAPTER. 

(The Preliminary Rites of the Rijasuya Sacrifie.) 

19. 

(The Relationship between the Bralıma aud Kşattra.) 

After Prajâ pati had created the sacrifice, the Brahma (divine knowledge) and the Kşaltra (sovereignty) were produced. After both two kinds of (472) creatures sprang up, such ones as eat the sacrificial food, and such ones as do not eat it. All ealers of the sacrificial food followed the Brahma, the non-eaters followed the Kşattra. Therefore, the Brabmans only are eaters of the sacrificial food; whilst the Kşattriyas, Vaisyas, and Sûdras do not eat it. 

The sacrifice went away from both of them. The Brahma and Ksat tra followed it. The Brahma followed with all its implements, and the Kşattra followed (also) with its implements. The implements of the Brahma are those required for performing a sacrifice. The implements of the Kşattra are a horse, carriage, an armour, and a bow with arrow. The Kşattra not leaching the sacrifice, returned ; for, frightenert by the weapons of the Kşattra, the sacrifice ran aside. The Bralıma then follo wed the sacrifice, and reached it. Hemming thus the sacrifice in its further course, the Brahma stood still ; the sacrifice reached and hemmed in its course, stood still also, and recognising in the hand of the Brah ina its owo implements, returned to the Brabma. The sacrifice having thus romainod only in the Bralınua, it is therefore only placed among the Brahmans (2,6., they alono are allowed to perform it.) 

The Kşattra thicu ral after this Brahma, and said to it, "Allow me to tako possossion of this sacrilico (which is placed in theo)." Tho Brahma suid, "Well, let it bo so ; lay down thy own weapons, assume by means of the implemouls of the Brabna (the sacrificial implement) which cons titute tho Bralına, tlo form of the Bralua, and return to it!” The Kşattra obeyou, laid down its own weapons, assumed, by means of the implements of the Brahma which constitute the Brahma, its form, and returned to it. Therefore even a Kşat (478) triya, when be lays clown his weapous and assunies the from of the Brahma by means of the sacrificial implomonlis, returns to the sacrilico (ho is allowed a sharo' in it.) 

324

(On the Place of Worshiping the Gods asked for by the King at the Rijasůya.) 

Then the king is to be requested to Forship the gods. They ask, II a Bralman, Kşattriya, or Vaisya, who is to be initiated into the sacrifi cial rites, requests the king to grant a place for the worship of the gods, whom must the king himself request to do so ? He must request the divine Kşattra. Thus they say. This divine Ksattra is Aditya [the sun]; for he is the ruler of all these beings. On the day on which the king is to be consecrated, in the forenoon, le must post himself torvards the rising siiu, and say, “This is among the lights the best light! [Rigveda 10, 1, 70, 3.] O god Savitar, grant me a place for the worship of gods.". By these words he asks for a place of worship. When Aditya, requested in this way, goes northwards, saying, "Yes, it may be so, ( grant it," thien nobody will do any harm to such a king, wbo is permitted [by Savitar to do so]. 

The fortune of a king who is consecrated in such a way by liaving secur ed the place of divine worship previously by the recital of the verse (men tioned above) and by addressing that request (to Savitar), will increase from day to day ; and sovereign power over his subjects will remain with lim. 

21. (474) (The Işțuipúria Aparijyânz 0,1] crings.) Then the burnt offering, called the Iştuplirlo uparijyini" is to be performed by the king who brings the sacrifice. The king should perform this ceremony before he receives the sacrificial inauguration (wiki). (\Vlien performing it) be throws four spoonfulls of melted butter in the Ahavanisi fire, saying, “to the preservation of the Lştu purtat! Mlay India the nighty

Some understood by it the duties of the castes and religious Brahmavical orders, as far 1# the digging of wells and making of ponds are concerned (whicli was a kind of religious obligation). Others meant by işta what refers to Smärta (donieslio) offoring, and quarta they interpreted as referring to the solemn sacrifices (órcinta.)

give us again (recompensate us for what we have sacrificed). May the Brahma give us again full compensation for what has been sacrificed." 

Then, after having recited the Samişta Yajus mantrass which are required when binding the sacrificial animal to the pillar, he repeats the words, “May Agni Jatavedas, recompensate us! May the Kşattra give us full compensation for what we have sacrificed, Svâhâ." These two Ahutis are the Iştâpûrta aparijyâni for a princely person when bringing a sacrifice. Therefore both are to be offered. 

22. 

(Thic A jílapunarvanya 4 O j'erings ) [475] Sujatu, the son of Arâlha, said that it is optional for the king to perform (besides the ceremony inentioned in 21) the two invocation offerings, called Ajitapunarvanya. He may bring them if he like to do so. He who, following the advice of Sujata, brings these two invocation offer ings, shall say, “1 turn towards the Brahma, may it protect me from the Kşattra, Svîbî to the Brahma!" "This, this is certainly the case ;” thus say the sacrificial priests (ilien this mantra is spoken by the king). The meaning of this formula is, He who turns towards the sacrifice, turns towards the Bralima; for the sacrifice is the Brahma; he, who undergoes the inauguration ceremony, is born again from the sacrifice. He who has turned towards the Brahma, the fişattra does not forsake. He says, "May tho Brabma protect me from the Kşattra," that is, the Bralma should protect him from the Kşattra (which is persecuting him). By the words, Srâhâ to the Bralma ! le pleases the Bralıma; and, if pleased, it protects liiun from the Kşattra. Then, after the recital of the Samista Yajus inantras, required for binding the sacrificial animal to the pillar, he ropcats, "I turn towards the Kşattra, may it protect me from the Brahma, Svähá to tlo kşaltra."

[476] repeats the words, "May the Kşattra protect me from the Brah ma,” that is, the Kşattra should protect him from the Bralıma, “ Sváha to the Kşattra! " he pleases this Kşattra. Pleased in this way, the Kşattra protects him from the Brahma. Both these offerings (ajita. punarvanyam) are also calculated to preserve the sacrificing king from the loss of the Iştậpûrta. Thence these two are (also) to be sacrificed.

(The King is, Before Sacrificing, Made ( Brulman, but he must 

Lose his Royal Qualifications.) As regards the deity, the royal prince (Kşattriya) belongs to lodra; regarding the metre he belongs to the Trişçubh; regarding the Stonna, he belongs to that one which is fifteen-fold. As to his sovereignty, he is Soina (king of the gods); as to his relationship, he belongs to the royal order. And, if inaugurated into the sacrificial rites, he enters even tlic Brahmanship at the time when he covers himself with the black goatskin, and enters on the observances enjoined to an inaugurated one, ancl Bral mans surround him. 

Wben he is initiated in such a manner, then Indra takes away from him sharpness of senses, Triştubh strength, the fifteen-fold Stoma the life, Somna takes away the royal power, the Pitaras (manes) glory and fame. (For they say)" he has estranged himself from us; for he is the Brahma ; he has turned to the Brahma.” The royal prince then, after having brought an invocation offering before the inauguration, shall stand near the Ahavanîya fire, and say, "I do not leave Imra as mpy doily, nor tho Triştubli as (iny) metro, nor the fifteen-fold Stoma, nor the king Som, nor the kinship of the Pitaras. Nay thorofure Iudid not take from me the skill, nor the Triştubh the strength, nor the lifteen-fold Stonia the life, nor Soma the royal power, nor the Pitaras glory and [477] renown. I approach here Agni as (iny) dcity with sharpness of senses, strength, life (vigour), renown and kinsbip. I go to the Gayatri metre, to the three-fold Stoma, to Soma the king, to the Brahma, I be come a Brâhmana." When he, standing before the Abaraniya fire, brings this invocation offering, then, although he be Kşattriya (by birth, no Brahman), Indra does not take from liim sharpness of sonses, not Triştubh strength, &o. 

327 

24. (Ilow the King becomes a Kşattriya again after the Sacrifice is over.) 

The royal prince belongs, as regards the deity, to Agni; his metre is the Gâyatrî, his Stoma the Trivrit (nine-fold), his kinsman the Brâh maņa. But when performing the concluding ceremony of the sacrifice, the royal princo (who was during the sacrifice a Brâhmana) assumes (by means of another offering) his royal dignity (which was lost) again. Then Agni takes away from him the (Brahmanical) lustre, Gåyatrî the strength, the Triviit Stoma the life, tho Brahmanas tho Brahma, and glory anal Tonown; for they say, this man has forsaken is hy assuming the Kşat tra again, to which he has returned. 

Then, after having performed the Samista offerings 5 which are le quired for the ceremony of binding the sacrificial animal to the pillar le presents himself to the Abavaniya fire (again), saying, "I do not leave, Agni as (my) deity, nor the Gayatrí as my metre, nor the Trivrit Stoma, nor the kindred of the Brahma. May Agni not take from me the lustre, nor the Gayatri the strength, nor the Trivrit Stoma the life, nor the Brahmanas glory and renown. With lustre, strength, life, the Brahma, glory, and renown, I turn to Indra as my deity, to the Triştublı (478) metre, to the fifteen-fold Stoma, to Soma the king, I enter the Kşattra, I become a Kşattriya! Oye Pitaras of divine lustre! Oye Pitaras of divine lustre! I sacrifice in my own natural character (as a Kşattriya, not as a Brahmana); what has been sacrificed by me, is my own, wliat bas been completo as to wells, tanks, &c., is my own, what austerities lave been undergone are my own, what burnt offerings have been brought are my own. That this is mine, this Agni will see, this Vâyu will hear, that Aditya will reveal it. I am only what I am (i. e., a Kşattriya, no Brâh mana)." When he speaks thus and gives an invocation offering to the 

Whavaniya sire, Agni does not take aivay from him the lustre, nor the Gayatri strength, nor the Trivit Stoma the life, nor the Brahmanas the Brahma, glory and renown, though he concludes the sacred rites as a Kşattriya.

man being initiated, announced by the formula, "the Brahmana is initiat. ed," should be promulgated in the case of the sacrificer being a Kşat triya? The answer is, The formula, “ the Brahmaņa is initiated," is to be kept when a Kşattriya is being initiated; the ancestral fire of the Ksat triya's house-priest is to be mentioned.? This, this is certainly so. 

(479) Having laid aside his own implements (weapons), and taking np those of the Bralıma, and having thus becomo Brahma, by mcans of the Brahma form, he returnod to the sacrifice. Therefore they should proclaim him as a Dikșita, with the name of his house-priest's ancestral fires, and invoke them also in the Pravara® prayer. 

*This is, according to Sây, thrico low and thrice aloud to be repeated. By repeating tho formula low, the inauguration is made known to the gods alone, but by repeating it aloud, it is announced to gods and men alike. 

For the Kşattriya cannot claim descent from the Rişis, as the Brahmans alone can do. 

By pravara, wbieh literally means " choice, particular address," (see (, 14), we havo to understand the invocation of the sacrificial fires lighted by the principal Risi ancestors of the sacrificer. This invocation may comprise only onc, or two, or three, or iye ancestral fires, the name of which is ârşeyja ; the pravara becomes accordingly ekcirseya, duyurseya, tryárseya, and pañclárşeya, i.e., having one or two, &c. Rişis. This invocation takes place at the very commencement of the sacrifice, after the fire has been kindled under the recital of the Simidleni verses, and at the time of the Subrahmanyî proclamation (see 0, 3), after the sacrificer has become, in conse quence of the initiatory rites, such as Dîkşi, Pravargya, &c, a Dîksita. Ašval. gives in his Srá úta Sntras (1,3), the following rules regarding this rite : 459 FUTOTT gauna यावन्तः स्युः परं परं प्रथमं ।पौरोहित्यानुराजविशां राजर्षीन्वा राज्ञां सर्वेषां मानवेति संशये. 1.e., the Hotar particularly mentions the fres of the Risi ancestors of the sacrificer, as many as he may have (one, or two, or three, or five), He mentions one after the other, but the first (in the general enumeration) is to be made the last (at the time of sacrificing). It the sacrificers happen to be Kşattriyas or Vaisyas, he mentions tho fires of the Rişi ancestors of their Purohitas (house-priests), or the princely Risis (renjasis, who might have been their ancestors) If there should be any doubt, the word meinava, info descended from or inacle by Mann, may be used in the case of all kings 

This explanation of tho terins pravara and irgerja have been already given by Max Müller (History of Ancient Sanscrit Literature, page 380) according to the authority of Ašvaldyana and Baudhayan. It has been doubted, of late, by Dr. Hall (in his paper on three Sanscrit Inscriptions in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal of 1862, page 115), but without any suficient reason. He says" pravaras" appear to be Dames of the families of certain persons from whom the founders of Gotras were descended, and of the families of the founders themselves,” But if this were the case, it would be surprising, tliat the founders of certain Gotras should claim to descend not only from one bat from several Rişi ancastors. All the Gotras have eight great ancestors only, viz, Visvâmitra, Jamadagni, Bharadvâja, Gautaina, Atri, Vasiştha, Kasyapa, and Agastya. These occupy with the Brahmans about the same position as the twelyo sons of Jacob with

28 [480]-(The Kşattriya is Not Allowed to Eat Sacrificial Food. 

The Brahma Priest Eats his Portion for Alim.) As regards the portion of sacrificial food which is to be eaten by the sacrificer, they ask, whether the Kşattriya should eat, or whether he should not eat it? They say, if he eat, then he commits a great sin, as having eaten sacrificial food, although he is an ahutad (one not per mitted to eat). If he do not eat, then he cuts himself off from the sacrifice (with which he was connected). For the portions to be eaten by the sacrificer, is the sacrifice. This is to be made over to the Brahma priest. For the Brahma priest of the Kşattriya is in the place of (his) Purohita. The Purohita is the one-half of the Kşattriya; only [481] through the intervention of another (the Brahma priest) the portion appears to be eaten by him, though he does not eat it with his own mouth. For the sacrifice is there where the Brahma (priest) is. The entire sacri. fice is placed in the Brahna, and the sacrificer is in the sacrifice. They throw the sacrifice (in the shape of the portion which is to be eaten by the sacrificer) into the sacrifice (which has the form of the Brahma), just as they throw water into water, fire into fire, without making it overflow, nor causing any injury to the sacrificer. There fore, is this portion to be eaten by the sacrificer (if he be a Kşattriya) to be given up to the Brahmâ. 

the Jews. Only he whose descent from one of these great Risis was beyond doubt, could become the founder of a Gotra. In this genealogy there is no proper place for the pravaras according to Dr. Hall's opinion: for a family calls itself generally only by the name of its founder. From a genealogical point of view, therefore, only the names of the patriarch (one of the great Risis) and those of the founders of the Gotras were important. The institution of the Pravaris is purely religious, and sacrificial. The pravaras or árseyas, which are used as synonymous terns, are those sacrificial fires which several Gotras bad in common; it was left to their own choice, to which they wished to repair. This had a practical meaning, as long as fire-worship was the prevailing religion of the Aryas, which was the case before the commencement of the properly so-called Vedic period. In the course of time it became a mere form, the original mean ing of which was very early lost. That tho arscyas refer to the sacrificial fire, may be clearly seen from the context, in which they occur. Their names are mentioned in the vocative, as soon as the fire is kindled. After they have been invoked, the Hotar begins at once the invocation of Agni, the fire, by various names, such as deveddko, manvid dho, &c., kindled by gods, kindled by Manu, &c. (Asy, Sr. S, 1, 3). That this rite of invoking the árşeyas must be very ancient, proves the occurrence of a similar, or even the same, rite with the Parsis, They invoke up to this day, in their confession of faith, those ancestors and beings who were of the same varena, i.e., choice, religion, as they are. The term for “I will prosess (a religion)" is fravarárzé, which is exactly of the same origin as prauara (See Yaína 12 in my Essays, page 164). 

330 

Some sacrificial priests, however, sacrifice this portion to the fire, saying, "I place thee in Prajapati's world, which is called vibhân (shining everywere), to be joined to the sacrificer, Svâhâ !” But thus the sacrificial priest ought not to proceed. For the portion to be eaten by the sacrificer is the sacrificer himself. What priest, therefore, asserts this, burns the sacrificer in the fire. (If anyone should observe a priest doing so) he ought to tell him, "Thou hast singed the sacrificer in the fire. Agni will burn his breaths, and he will consequently die." Thus it always happens. Therefore he should not think of doing so.

FIFTH CHAPTER On the Sacrificial Drink uchich the King has to Taste instead of Soma, According to the Instruction given by Râma Margaveya to the King Visvantara.) 

27. (Story of the Sy@parnas. Rama Defends their Rights.) Vispantara, the son of Suşådman, deprived the Syâparnas of their right of serving as his sacrificial [482] priests, and interdicted any one of this family to take part in his sacrifice. Having learnt (that) they went to the place of his sacrifice and seated themselves within the precincts of the Vedi. On observing them, Visvantara said (to his attendants), * There sit those Syâparnas, the scoundrels, who endeavour to sully another's fame. Turn them out; let them not sit in the Vedi,” The attendants obeyed and turned the Syâparnas out. They then cried aloud, * \ben Janamejaya, the son of Parişkit, was performing a sacrifice without the Kaśyapas (who were lis hereditary priests), then the Asitamrigas from among the Kaśyapas turned the Bhútaviras (who were officiating instead of the Kasyapas) out, not allowing them to administer the Soma rites. They succeeded because they had brave men with them. * Well, what hero is now among us, who might by force take away this Soma beverage (that we might administer it ourselves) ? " "This your man am I," said Rama Märgaveya, * This Râma belonged to the Syâpar - nas, and had completed the sacred study. When the Syâparnas rose

to leave, then he said to the king, "Will (thy servants), o king, turn out of the Vedi even a man (like me) who knows the sacred science ?" (The king answered), “O thou member of the vile Brahman brood, * whoever thou art, how hast thou any knowledge (of such matters) ? " . 

28. [483] (Why Indra was Excluded from Tris Share in the Soma. The 

Kşattriya Race Became also Excluded.) - (Råma said) "I know it from the fact, that Indra had been excluded by the gods (from having any share in the sacrifices). For he had scornedVisvarûpa, the son of Tvaştar, cast down VỊitra · (and killed him), thrown 'pious men (yatis) before the jackals (or wolves) and killed the Arurmaghas, and jebuked (484) (his teacher) Brihaspati. 

* Sây. explains bruhmabandhu by brahmana adhana, teen, lowest Brahman. No doubt, there is something contemptible in this expression, 

* In the original, ablıya maista. This cannot mean (according to etymologs), “be killed" as Sây, supposes, misguided by the story told in the Taittir. Sanik. 2, 4, where Indra is said to have cut the three heads of Visvarapa, which were somapánam (drinking of Soma), surapainan (drinking of spirituous liquor), and annadanam (eating of food). The reason alleged for Indra's killing him is that he, as a relation of the Asuras, informed them about the secret portions of the sacrificial food, Soma, &c., whilst he told the Doras, whose associate he was, only the real and visible ones, Indra holding that he who knows the secret portions of Soma, &c., will come to know the real ones also, became afraid lost the Asuras might, strengthened by Soma, overthrow his rule, and killed the perpetralor of such a treason by cutting of his three heads, each of which was transform ed into a particular kind of bird, Visvarûpa being a Brahman, Indra thus became guilty of the horrible crime of Brahman-murder (brahmahatyā). All beings called bim "murderer of a Brahman," so that he could not ûnd rest anywhere. He requested the Earth to take off the third part of his guilt, who under certain condi'ions complied with his request. To be relieved from the two remaining thirds of his burden, he applied to the trees, and the women, who readily took under certain conditions a part of his guilt upon then selves. Tvaştar, the father of Vairûpa, excluded Indra from any share in the Soma sacrifice ; but ho took his share with force. The remaining portion of Indra's share was thrown into the sacrificial fire by Tyastar, with the words, "Grow (vardhasva) into an enemy of Indra." This became the terrible foe of Indra, known in the legends by the name of vritra. Indra succeeded afterwards in killing him. See the same legend in the Kâusitaki Upanişad. 3, 1. 

• In the Kaus. Up. 3, 1, we find the form Arunmiklu Sây, thinks them to be Asuras in the disguise of Brahmans. With this explanation agrees Pankaracharya on the whole in his Commentary on the Kâuş. Up. (page 75, ed. Cowell). He divides the word into rurmuycha, and the negative as The üret is to mean "the study of the Vedas," and the second mouth." Therefore the whole means, according to him, in " whose mouth is not the study of the Vedas." This explanation is quite artificial and unsatisfactory. The Arurmaghas (this is propably the right form) were, no doubt, a kind of degraded Aryas, very likely a tribe of the ancient Iranians, in whose language (the Zend) the words aurvo and magha are frequently to be met withi.On account of these faults, Indra was forth with excluded from partici pation in the Soma beverage. And after Indra had been excluded in this way from the Soma, all the Kşattriyas (at whose head he is) were likewise excluded from it. But he was allowed a share in it afterwards, having stolen the Soma from Tvaştar. But the Ksattriya race remains excluded from the Soma beverage to this day. There is one here who knows the way in which the Kşattriya, who is properly excluded from the Soma beverage, may relish in this juice. Why do thy men expel such a man from the Vedi?" The king asked then, "Dost thou. O Brahmana, know this way?" Ravia answered, “Yes, I know it." The king then replied, "Let me know it, 0 Brahmana." Rama answered. "I will let thee know here, O king." 

29, (Whiclt Portions of Sacrificial Drink the King has to Aroid.) The priests may take any one of the three portions (which are to be left), either Soma, or curds, or water. When they take the Soma, which is the portion allotted to Brahmaņas, then thou wilt favour the Brahmanas by it.' Thy progeny will be distinguished by the charac teristics of the Brahmana; for they will be ready to take gifts, tbirsty after drinking (Somal, and hupgry of eating food, and ready to roam about everywhere according to their pleasure. [485] When there is any fault on the Kşattriya (who, when sacrificing, eats the Brâhmaņa portion), then his progeny has the characteristics of a Brahmaņa; but in the second or third generation he is then capable of entering com pletely the Brâhmaņaship, and he will have the desire of living with the Brahmânic fraternity. 

When they take the curds, which is the share of the Vaisyas, then thou wilt favour the Vaisyas by it (and consequently be brought near them). Thy offspring will be born with the characteristics of the Vais yas, paying taxes to another king, to be enjoyed by another; they will be oppressed according to the pleasure of the king. When there is any fault on the Kşattriya who, when sacrificing, eats the Vaisya portion), then his progeny is born with the characteristics of a Vaidya ; and in the second or third degree, they are capable of entering the caste of the Vaibyas, and are desirous of living in the condition of a Vaišva (i.e., they will have the nature of a Vaisya). 

* That is to say, thou wilt, when regenerated in thy son and grandson, bo accopted by the Bråbmapas as a member of their caste, 

333 

When thou takest the water, which is the share of the Sûdras, then thou wilt please the Sûdras by it. Thy progeny will have the character istics of the Sûdras, they are to serve another the three higher castes, to be expelled and beaten according to the pleasure of their masters.) When there is any fault on the Kşattriya (who, when sacrificing, eats the Sûdra portion), then his offspring will be born with the character istics of the sûdras; and in the second or third degree, be is capable of entering the condition of the Sûdras, and will be desirous of passing his life in that condition. 

80. (TVhich Portion the King should choose at the Sacrifice. The Origin and 

Meaning of Nyagrodha.) These are the three portions (bhakşas,) O King, of which the Kşattriya, when performing a sacrifice, [486] must choose none. But the following is liis own portion, which he is to enjoy. He must squeeze the airy descending roots of the Nyagrodha tree, together with the fruits of the Udumbaral, Asvattha, and Flakşa trees, and drink the juice of them. This is his own portion. 

(For the origin of the Nyagrodha tree is as follows): When the gods, after the (successful) performance of their sacrifice, went up to heaven, they tilted over (1173-ubjan) the Soma cups, whence the Nyagrodha trees grew up. And by the name of Nyubja, i.e., tilted over, they are not called in Kuruksetra, where they grew first; from them all the others originated. They grew descending the roots (nyañcho rohanti). There fore what grows downwards, is a downward growth (nyagroha); and for this name, signifying "downward growth," they called the tree "Nya yrudlia." 8 It is called by the name Nyagrodha, whose meaning is Lidden (to men), and not by the more intelligible pame Nyagrola, for the gods like to conceal the very names of objects from men, and call them by names unintelligible to them. 

81. 

On the Meaning of the King's Drinking the Juice of the Nyagrodha Tree 

instead of Soma.) That portion of the juice in these Soma cups which went downwards became the descending roots, and of the other which went up, the fruits were produced. That Kşattriya, therefore, who enjoys the juice of 

* The word is traced to the rout ruh, lo grow, the older foru of which is rudh ; compare avoradha, " the descending roots," 

OUI 

the descending roots of the Nyagrodha tree, and that of its fruits, is not debarred from his own share (bhakşa). Further, he thus obtains the Soma beverage by means of a substitute, though he does not enjoy [487] the real Soma, but only in the form of a substitute ; for the Nyagrodha is just this substitute of the Soma. The Kşattriya (when drinking the juice of the Nyagrodha) enters the form of the Brahma by the medium of another (not direct), viz., through the relationship of his purohita (with the Brahmans), his own Dîkşi (at which the king himself was made a Brâhmana for a little while), and the Pravara of his Parohita. The Ksattra (ruling power) occupies (among men the same place as) the Nyagrodha among the trees, for the Kşattra are the royal princes, whose power alone is spread here (on this earth), as being alone invested with sovereign power. The Nyagrodha is,' as it were, firmly established in the earth (and thus a sign of the duration of the royal power); and by means of its descending roots expanded (in all directions, and therefore a sign of the great extent of the power of the Ksattriyas over the whole earth). When the Kşattriya who performs a sacrifice enjoys (the juice squeezed out of the) descending roots of the Nyagrodha tree, and its fruits, then he places in himself royal power (exercised by the Nyagrodha) over the trees, and into the Kşattra his own Self. He then is in the Kşattra, and the royal power represented by the Nyagrodha over the trees, is then placed in him. Just as the Nyagrodha tree has, by means of its descending roots, a firm footing on the earth (for it is multiplied in this way), the royal power of a Kşattriya who enjoys, vlien sacrificing, this portion (as food) has a firm footing, and his rule cannot be overthrown. 

- 32 [488] (The Symbolical Meaning of the Fruits of the Udumbaroi, Asvaltha, and Plakşa Trees. What Implements are Required for this quasi-Soma 

Feast of the King.) As to the fruits of the Udumbara tree, which originated from the vigour which is in food, and in which there is all the vigour of the trees, furnishing nourishments, the Ksatriya (when drinking the juice prepared from its fruits) places in the Kşattra food, and what yields nourishment from the trees. 

* The tree (a kind of the Ficus indica) is very strong, 

335 

As to the fruits of the Asvattha tree, which sprang out of lustre, and which has the sovereignty over the trees, the Kşattriya (when drinking the juice prepared from its fruits) places in the Kşattra lustre and the sovereignty over the trees. 

As to the fruits of the Plakşa tree, which sprang out of glory, and in which there is the independence and brilliancy of the trees represented, the Kşattriya places in this way the independence and brilliancy which is in the trees in the Kshattra. 

When all these things (the roots of the Nyagrodha tree, &c.) are in readiness for him, then the priests buy the Soma, and perform for the king the several ceremonies preceding the eve of the festival, just in the same way as the real Soma is treated. Then the day before the celebration (of the feast) the Adhvaryu should have all these things ready which are required for the preparation of the Soma juice, such as the (goat) skin (placed below), the two boards required for squeezing, the Dronakalasa, the cloth (for purifying), the stones, the Půtabhrit, the Adhavaniya, the Sthali, the Udanehnam and the Chamasa,10 Then [489] they should make 

1* Here are the principal implements required for squeezing, preparing, keeping, sacrificing and drinking the Soma juice mentioned. A detailed knowledge of them constitutes one of the principal qualifications of an Adhvaryu. Their description is thereforo to be found principally in the Satras of the Yajurveda (see the 9th and 10th Adhyaya of the Kitiya sätras, the 8th and 9th Praína of the Hiran yakesi Sûtras, SÅ yana's Commentary on the 4th Prapathaka of the 1st Kânda of the Taittiriya Sau hita, founded on tho Apastamba Sranta Sûtras). 

In ordor to make the use of these vessels intelligible to the reader, I subjoin here a short doscription of the preparation of the Soma juice, partially from what I myself have witnessed, partially from the ritual books and oral information, 

The plant which is at present used by the sacrifcial priests of the Dekkhan at the Sona feast, is not tho Soma of the Vedas, but appears to belong to the same order. It grows on hills in the neighbourhood of Poona, to the height of about 4 to 5 feet, and formos a kind of bush, consisting of a certain number of shoots, all coming from the same root; thoir stom is solid like wood; the bark greyish; they are without leaves, the sap appears whitish, has a very stringent taste, is bitter, but not sour; it is a very nasty drink, and has soine intoxicating effect. I tasted it several times, but it was impossible for me to drink more than some tea-spoonfulls. 

The juico is obtaind in the following way: The Adhvaryu firot spreads a skin (charma), and puts on it the Soma shoots which are called arsu or valli. He now takes two boards, adhişavara; tho first is placed above the Soma. He beats the board with one of the so-called grávanas, i.e., Soma squeezing stones, takes the shoots (as many as le requires for the particular Savana) from below the boards, ties them together, and places the other board above them. He then pours water from the Vasatîvari pot (see page 114-115) on this board ; this water is called nigräbhya. He now takes certain num ber of shoots (there are, for instance, for the libation from the Upâmsu Graha, which is the ürst of all, six required) out of the whole bunch which lies between the two boards, 

336 

two parts of what is squeezed for the king (the roots of the Nyagrodha, &c); one is to [490] be made ready for the morning libation, the other - to be left for the midday libation. 

33. (The Drinking from the Traita Cups.) Vhen the priests lift the Traita cups for " sacrificing, then they shall lift up the cup of the eacrificer [491] also, having thrown upon it holds over them the Soma squeezing stone, and shakes them thrice in the Chamasa (cup) of the Hotar, towards the right side. This is the Nigrábhu. He wete them with the waters of the Vasativari pot. Now he puts them on a large stone, places upon them some grass, anil beats the shoots in order to extract the juice. The technical term for this beating is, abhisuoti. Each abhisava, or completo extracting of the Soma juice consists of three turns (paryayas); in the first, the Adhvaryu beats the shoots eight timos, and makes the Nigráhna in the manner described above, in the second turn, he beats them eleven times, and in the third twelve times, making at the end of each the Nigräbha. The juice which the Adhvaryu catches at the end of each turn with his band, is thrown into a vessel (at the first abhisava in the Upå msu Graha). 

After this frst or preliminary abhisavo, follows the mahābhisava or the great squeezing ceremony, performed exactly in the same way as the first, with the only difference, that the Adhvaryu takes from between the two boards as many Sopa shoots as are required for the rest of the Savanam (libation). If the juice is extracted, it is poured in the Adhavaniya, a kind of trough. Thence it is poured in a cloth, in order to strain it. This cloth is called Pavitra or Daśđpavitra. Below the cloth is anotber trongh, called Pitâbhșit (i.e., the bearer of what is strained, purified). The Udgåtar must hold the cloth when the juice is strained. 

Single shoots of the Soua, and drops of its juice, are put in several sthâlis or small vessels generally used for keeping butter. The libations are poured from two kinds of vessels, from the Grahas (see page 118), and the Chamasas 'cups). Each offering from it Graha coosists of a certain number of Dharás or portions (of a liquid substance). So, for instance, the offering from the Agrayana Graha, at the evening libation, consists of the following four Dharás: that one which is in the Agrayana sthålî (not the Graha) taken by the Adhvarya; the two portions which remained in the Aditya Graha (the libation from which precedes that from the Agrayana), and in the Ajya sthali (the pot with melted butter); these two are taken by the Pratipastbåtar; the fourth Dhårå is taken from the Adhavaniya trough by the Unnetar. Each of the four Dhårås is first strained by a cloth held over the Patábhrit vessel. The Unpetar takes his Dbârâ with a vessel, called Udonchana, or with a Chamasa. These four Dhârâs are then illed from the Půtabhrit in the Agrayana Graha, and sacrificed in the usual way. Certain offerings are filled in the Grabas from another very large trongh, the so-called Dronakalasa (one such vessel is in my possession). At certain occasions, there is not only the mouth of the Graha to be filled up to the brim, but the small cup, put in it (which alone was originally the Graba; but, after the latter term had become identical with Pátra, the vessel itself, the smill cap, was called atigraha), is also filled; this is called atigráhya. 

l! They are called here traita cha masa. There are, on the whole, ten such curs; therefore traita cannot be referred to tri, i.e., three. In all likelihood, the word is 

two young sprouts of Dharba grass; both are the one after the other) to be thrown on the wooden sticks surrounding the fire, by the formula Vaupat! liter having thrown the first, the priest repeats the rerse, cldliknitno akrişum (4, 39, 6), concludiog with Srathi and Vaugat. After having thrown the second Dharba stalk, he repeats the verse, it dadhikmili śarasů (, 38, 10.) When the priests then take the Soma cups to drink themselves, the sacrificer should take his cup also. When they lift them up (to drink), the sacrificer should do the same. When the Hotar then calls the Ilå (just before drinking) to the place, and drinks from his cup, then the sacrificer should drink bis cup iThilst repeating the following verse, " That has remained of the juicy Soma beverage whilst Indra drank with his hosts, this his remainder I enjoy with my happy mind, I drink the king Soma." This beverage prepared from the trees (above men tioned) promising fortune to him, becomes drunk with a happy mind. The royal power of a Kşattriya who, when sacrificing, drinks only this portion described, becomes strong, and is not to be chaken. 

[492] By the words, “Be a blessing to our heart thou who art drunk ! prolong our life, o Soma, that we may live long!” he then cleans his mouth ; for, if the juice remaining on his lips) is not wiped off, then Soma, thinking, "an un torthy drinks ine,” is able to destroy the life of a mau. But if the juice is wiped off in this way, then he prolongs the life. With the following two verses, which are appropriate for the sacri. fice, âpyayusva sametu (1, 91, 10) and sanit te payâmsi samayantu (1, 91, 181, he blesses the Chamasa (i. e., vhat be has drunk from it) to bear fruit. That is appropriate in the sacrifice, that is successful. connected with Trita, who was the first physiciau, and the Sowa being the best of all mcdicincs, supposed to have invented such cups. Siiyana doos not explain the torin in his Commentary on tho Aitarera Brahmanam - but his attempt at an explanation in that on the Taittiriya Sambitâ (ii. page 253, . Cowell) shows that he bad evidently no clear idea of what the original meaning mas; for after having tried more than one explanation 

om the mainile original weinings fit after has from the zomeral tri, he exclaims," but it is not enouglı; one should see that traita means "good, excelleni,' prasista),” But we need not despair of making out its mean ing. If we compare the term, traitu chamasa with that of narusansa chamasa, (in 7, 34), we can pretty clcarly see what it must mean. As I have stated abovo (in noto 24, on pago 124-125), tho Chamasa aro Narašalisa, that is to say, they belong to the deity Narisansa, after one has drank out of theia, sprinkled water over them, &c. Now, from 2 Chamasa, they generally drink twice. What is filled in for the first timo is Trûäta, ic, bclougs to Tritu ; afterwards, it is clcancd abd illed again. This then is the Nara San sa draught. [lu Corrigenda tlic translator says " my opinion on the Traita cups rcsts on a doubtful reading." Again, in the Corrections to Vol, 1,, he writes : --" The rare word traitut appears to have been vory carly misunderstood."--Editor.]

(The Drinking from the Narâšamsa cups. The List of Teachers of the Suha 

stitute for the Soma Juice, and the Rites Connected with it.) 

When the priests put the Traita cups down, then the king should put down the sacrificer's cup also; when they incline their cups (after having put them down), then the king should do the same with his cup. Then be should take up the [Narasaṁsa] cup, and by the recital of the verse "O thou divine Soma, who knowest my mind, who art drunk by Nara famsa, and enjoyed by the Uma-Pitaras " I enjoy thee !" In this way the king enjoys the Narâšansa portion at the morning libation. At the midday libation, le repeats the same mantra, but says, “enjoyed by the Uraucun (Pitaras)," and at the evening libation, he says, “enjoyed by the Kávya [493] (Pitaras)." For the Pitaras (present) at the morning libation, are the Umas, those (present) at the midday libation, are the Urvas, and those at the evening libation, are the Kâvyas. In this way, he makes the immoi tal Pitaras enjoy the libations, 

Priyavrata, the Soina drinker, said, “Whoever enjoys the Soma beverage, he certainly will be inmortal." The ancestors of a king who enjoys, when sacrificing, this Narasaṁsa portion, therefore, become immortal (i c., they never will perish), when they enjoy (in such a way) the Souna libation, and his royal power will be strong anıl is not to be shaken. The ceremony of wiping off from the mouth what of the juice remained, and the sprinking of the cup with water (@pyâljanam) is the same as above (when the Traita Chamaşa are emptied). All the three libations of the juice prepared for the king, should be performed in the same way as the real Soma libation, 

This way of enjoying the Soma juice (by means of a substitute), was told by Râma Mârgaveya to Visvantara, the son of Suşadman. The king then, after having been told it, said, “We give thee a thousand cows, O Brahmaņa. My sacrifice is to be attended by the Syâparnas.” 

This portion (bhakşa) was told by Tura, the son of Kavaşı, to Jana mejaya, the son of Parikşit; then by Parvala and Närada to Somaka, the son of Sahadeva; thence (this traditional knowledge) passed to Saladeva

This portion, further, was told hy Agni to Samnsrula Arindame; thence it passed to Kraturid Jânaki. This portion was further Lokal by Vasistha to Sudâs, the son of Pijavanai. 

[494] All these becanie great, in consequence of their having drunk the Soma in this way (by means of a substitute), and were great kings. Just as the sun (placed on the sky) sends forth varnith, thus the king who, when sacrificing drinks the Soma in this way, is placed amidst fortune and shines everywhere, from all directions he exacts tribute, bis kingdom becomes strong, and is not to be shaken.

FIRST CHAPTER. (The Sastras and Stotras required at the Soma Day of the 

Rajastya.) 

y 

The Use of Both the Rathantaran and Brihat at the Midday Libation) 

Now, as regards the Stotras and Sastras (required at the king's liba tion), both the morning and the evening libations do not differ in this point from the rule of the Aikähikas (Soma sacrifice of one day's duration): for both these libations at the Aikâhika sacrifices are indisturbable, well arrangeri, aod firmly standing, and they produce quiet, good order, firm footing, and security. 

(But there is a difference in the ceremonies of the midday libation.) The midday Pavamâna performance (of a sacrifice, which requires both Samans with the Brihat for the Priştha Stotra, has been told : 

The expression ukta, "told," appears to refer to 4, 10, uble brihad ratlantare pávamai na yar bhavatas, But the reference is not quite exact. The author wishes, doubtless, to advert to the peculiar circumstance, that both the principal Samans are used at one and the same day, viz., on the Soma day of the Rajasůya. It is even against the general principles of the sacrificial theory to use both on the sanze day (sce 4, 13), as the whole arrangement of the Dvada sâha sacrifice with its Rathantara and Brihat days clearly shows There are only three exceptions to this rule, as far as my knowledge goes, viz., on the Abhijit and Pişuvar days, and on the Abhisechanila day of the Râjasûya, woich is perforned according to the rites of an aikahiku Soma sacrilce (see 8,4). The particulars of the ceremonies of the Abhijit day are not given in our Brâhmagam ; but we learn them from the Asval. Sûbras (8,5) Thero it is said: Abhijit Brinat-přischa ubhayascima yadyapi Ruthantaran yajajajíiyasithune, 1.loy the Abhijit sacrifice requires the Brihat as its Pristha Stotra (at the unidday libation), and (thus) both (the principal) Símans, if the Rathantaran (is used at the evening libation) instead of the Yajñayajniya Sâman (used at the evening libation of the Agnistoma). The exceptional use of Brihat and Rathantaran on the Vişuran day has been stated by our author (4, 19, compare Ašval. 8,0). On the use of both those samans at the Rajasaya sacrifice, Ašval, (9,3) makes the following remark : ukthyo brilat pristha ubhayasama abhishechaniyah, i.e., on the inauguration day, the Ukthya sacrifice takes place, with the modification that the Brihat is the Sama of the Pristha Stotra, and that both (the prin cipal) Sámans (Brihat and Rathantaram) are required. Both are, as we learn distinctly from our Brâhmapam, required at the midday libation ; the Rathantaram being chanted 

0 

(496) for the chanting of both Samans (the Rathantara and Brihat) is performed. The verse, i tvc rathain yathotaya (8,57,1-3) is the beginning (required for the Sastra; belonging to the Rathantara Sâman; the verse idam vaso sutam andha (8, 53, 5-7), the sequel required for the same Sas tra. This Pavamána Uktham (the just-mentioned Shastra) is just the Marutvatîya Sastra, to which the Rathantara Sâman (at the Agniştoma, for instance) belongs. They perform the Rathantara chant at the Pava mapa Stotra ( of the midday libation) praised at this (sacrifice); the Brihat is the Přiştha (Stotra), in order to give a prop (to the whole). For the Rathantara is Brahma ; the Bụibat is the Kşattra. The Brahma certainly precedes the Kşattra. For the [497] king should think “when the Brahma is at the head, then my royal porver would become strong and not be shaken." Turtler, the Rathantara is food ; if placed first, it pro cures food to the king. The Rathantara further is the earth, thich is a firm footing ; is placed first, it therefore procures a firm footing to the king. 

The Pragatha for calling Indras near remains the same without any modification (as in the Brahmanical sacrifices), this Pragatha belonging to (all) Soma days. The Pragatha addressed to Brahmanaspati, * which has the characteristic of ut (rutlastha, rise!) is appropriate to both the Sâ mans which are chanted. Tlie Dhyâyyâss are the same without any modification ; they are those appropriate for the Abîna sacrifices, whilst that Marutvatiya Pragatha, which is peculiar to the Aikâhikas, is chosen, 

(The Remainder of the Marutvatiya Shastra, and the Nishkevalya Sastra.) 

The (Nivid) hymn (of the Pavamâna uktham) is janisthå ugrah (10, 731? It contains the terms, ngra strong, and sahas power, which first, and the Brihat aiter it. The former forms here part of the Pavamana Stotra (the first at the midday libation), the latter is the (principal) Pristla Stotra which follows the frst. The Kastra belonging to the Pavamâna Stotra is the Marutvatîya (sec 3, 12-20), that for the Přiştha Stotra is the Nişkevalya (sec 3, 21-24). At the Rajashya sacrifice, the first goes by the name of Pazamiina-uktham, the latter by that of Graha ukiham. 

2 The royal sacrifice differs from the Brahmanical here by the employment of both the principal Samans at the same time; whilst at the latter sacrifice, either is employed separately. 

* See about it 3, 16. It is repeated on all Soma days, and forms always part of the first Sastra of the midday libation. Thence it is also necessary at the Rajastya). 

* See 8, 17 (page 184). * See 3, 18.

are chracteristic of the Kşattra. The worl, ojistha, 'the strongest," is also a characteristic of the Kşattra. The words, bahulabhimanah (in the first rerse) contain the term ahihi, which means, "to over porver, defeat," (which is a characteristic of the Ksattram (498) also). The hymn consists of eleven verses, for the Triştubh com prises eleven syllables, and the Ksattriyas share in the nature of the Triştubb. Ojas (in ojiştha) is Indra's power, viryam (strength) is Triştubh ; the Kşattra is power (ojas), and the Kşattriya race is the strength (as to progeny). Thus le (the priest) makes him (the Kşattriya) successful in strength, royal power, and progeny. By this Gaurivîti hymn the Marutvatiya Sastra becomes successful, on which a Brahmaṇams has been told. 

(Now Follows the Nişkevalya Sustran) The verse, trân ildhi lavamahe (6, 46, 1-2), forms the Brihat Pristha. For the Bribat Sâma is the Kşattram ; by means of the Ksattra, the king makes complete his royal poiver. the Brihat is the Ksattra, then the soul of the sacrificer is the Nişkevalya Sastra (to whiclı the Brihat Sàma belongs). That is what the Brilat Pristha becomes (for the sacrificer). The Brihat is the Kshattra ; by means of the Ksattra, the Bțihat makes him successful. The Bribat is further precedence, and in this respect it makes him successful also. The Brihat is further ex cellence, and in this respect it makes him successful also. 

They make the Rathantara Sama, abhi två šūra nonumah , the Anil riipalo to the BỊihat. For the Rathantara is this world, and the Brihat is that world. That world corresponds to this one, and this [499] world to that one. Therefore, they make the Rathantara the Anurûpa to the Brihat, for thus they make the sacrificer enjoy both worlds. 

Further, the Rathantara is the Brahma, and the Ksattra the Brihat; thus the Kşattra is tlien placed in the Brahma, and the Brahma in the Kşattra. There is then prepared for both the Sânians the same place. The Dhảyyâ is yad vävânc (10, 74, 6), of which a Brahmanam'1 has been already told. The Sâma Pragatha is, ubhayam śrinavachcha (8, 50, 1-2); for it is a characteristic of both Sâ mans which are sung (on account of its containing the word ubhayam, both.) 

8 Janistâugrah (See above). The Riņi is supposed to be Gauriviti. * It begins, tad vá etad yajamána jananam. See 4, 19 (page 65 of the text). 

10 That is to say, the Hotar repeats as counterpart to the Stotriya of the Nigkevalya Sastra, which is at this occasion the text of the Brihat Sâma, the text of the Rathan taram, which is quite unusual.

(The Nivid Súkta of the Nişkcvalya Sastra). 

The lıymı, tam şu tuhi yo abhibhůtyoja (0, 18), contains the character istic abhi in the word abhibhuti. Its words, aşálham (unconquerable), ugram (strong), sahamânam (being strong), contain characteristics of the Kşattra also. It consists of fifteen reises ; for the number fifteen is strength, sharp ness of senses, and power, the Kşattra is strength, the royal prince, is might (riryam). The hymn thus makes the king successful in strength, royal power and might. It is a hymn of Bharad raja. The Brihat Sâman was seen by Bharadvâja 'also (and) is in direct relationship with the ancestral fire.12 The sacrifice of the Kşattriya which has the Brihat for [500] (Stotra) becomes successful. Thence, wherever a Kşattriya brings a sacrifice, there the Brihat Priştha is to be employed, for this makes it (the sacrifice) complete 

(The Sastras of the Minor Hotri-priests.) 

The performances of the ininor Hotţi-priests (Maitráv aruña, Brahmana clamsi, and Achhà vâka) required at the sacrifice of a Kşattriya) are those allotted to the Aikâhika sacrifices. For these Aikâhika perform ances are propitiatory, ready made, and placed on a footing, in order to make the sacrifice successful to accomplish it, and place it on a firm footing whence it cannot fall down. These (performances) contain all the forms (required), and are quite complete. (They are repeated) in order to accomplish the integrity and completeness of the sacrifice). The Ksattriyas who perform a sacrilico should think, "Let us obtain all desires by means of the all-perfect and complete performances of the minor Hutri-priests." Therefore, wherever the Ekâbas are not completo as to the number of Stomas and Prişthas, there are the Aikâhika perform

ances of the minor Hotri-priests required, 13 then it (the sacrifice) be comes completed. 

This sacrifice (performed by a Kşattriya) should be the Ukthya, Thich has lifteen Stotras and Sastras. [501] Such is the opinion of some. Eor the sharpness of senses is a power (ojas), and the number fifteen is strength; (furtner) the Kşattra is power, and the Kşattriya is strength. Thus the priest makes him (the Kşattriya) succeseful by means of power, Kşattra, (and) strength. This sac rifice requires thirty Stotras and Sastras (vis., fifteen each'. For the Viraj consists of thirty syllables. The Viraj is food. When he places him (the sacrificer) in the Viraj, then he places him in food. Therefore the Ukthya, which is fifteen-fold, should be (employed for the king at this occasion). But the Agnistoma, which forms part of the Jyotiştoma, would more properly answer this purpose 14 For, among the Stomas, the Trivșit (nine-fold) is the Brahma, and the fifteen-fold Stoma is the Kşat tra. But the Brahma precedes the Kşattra: (for the king should think) "If the Brahma is placed first, my kingdom will be strong and not to be sbaken. The number seventeen represents the Vaisyas, and twenty one the Sadras. If these two Stomas (the seventeen and twenty-one fold) are employed, then they make the Vaisyas and Sûdras follow him (the king). Among the Stomas, the Triviit is splendour, the fifteen-fold is strength, the seventeen-fold is offspring, the twenty-one-fold is the footing. Thus the priest makes the king, who (thus) sacrifices, successful in gaining splendour, strength, offspring, and a firm footing. Therefore the Jyotişļoma (Agniştoma) is required. This requires twenty-four Stotras aud Sastras (twelve each). For the year consists of twenty four half months; in the year there are all kinds of) nourishment. Thus he places him (the sacrificer) in all kinds of) nourishment. Thence the Jyotiştoma-Aguiştoma alone is required (and not the Ukthya).

SECOND CHAPTER. (Pungra bhişeka, or Repetition of the Inauguration Ceremony.) 

5. (The Implements and Preparation for Punarabhişeka.) Now follows (the rule) of Punarabhiseka of the Ksattriya who is inaugurated as a sacrificer, and whose Kşattram is in (such a way) new born. After having undergone the ceremonies of ablutions and perform ed the animal sacrifice (anubandhya), he performs the concluding Isti. 

After this Isti is finished (and thus the Soma day of the Râjaşûya concluded), they sprinkle him again with the boly water (they make punarabhişeka). Before it commences, all implements must be in readiness, viz., a throne, made from Udumbara wood, with feet only as large as the span between the thumb and forefinger, and successive helmets of the length of half an arm, (besides there must be provided for) cords for bind ing made of Muñja grass, a tiger skin for covering the throne, a (large) ladle of Udumbara wood and a (small) branch of the Udumbara tree. In this ladle the following eight substances are thrown: curds, honey, clarified butter, rain-water fallen, during sunshine, young sprouts of grass and of green barley, liquor and Dûb grass (Dûrvâ). The throne is to be placed in the southern line, drawn by a wooden sword (sphya) in the Vedi, the front part (508] turned eastwards. Two of its feet are to be within the Vedi and two outside. For this earth is (the goddess of) fortune; the little space within the Vedi is thus allotted to her, as well as the large (infinite) region outside. If thus two feet of the throne are inside and two outside the Vedi, both kinds of desires, those obtainable from the place within as well as from outside the Vedi, are to be gained.

king makes his Kşattra (royal poter) prosper, The king, when taking his seat on the throne, approaches it from behind, turning his face east wards, kneels down with crossed legs, so that his right knee touches the 

and (holding the throne with his hands) prays over it the follow ing mantra : 

"May Agni ascend thee, O throne, with the Gâyatri metre! May Savitar ascend (thee) with the Uşnih, Soma with the Apustubb, Brihas pati with the Brihat, Mitra and Varuņa with the Pankti, Indra with the Triştubh, and the Viśve Devâh with the Jagati metres. After them I ascend this throne, to be ruler, to be a great ruler, to be an uni versal rulerto obtain all desires fulfilled, to be an indepen- (504) dent and most distinguished ruler (on this earth), and to reach the world of Prajâpati, to be there a ruler, a great ruler, a supreme ruler, to be in. dependent, and to live there for a long time!” 

After having repeated this mantra, the king should ascend the throne, with his right knee first, and then with his left. This, this is done; so they say, 

The gods joined with the metres, which were placed in such an order that the following exceeded the preceding one always by four syllables, ascended this throne,) Thich is fortune, and posted themselves on it, Agni with the Gâyatri, Savitar with the Uşpib, Soma with the Anušțubh, Brihaspati with the Brihati, Mitra and Varuna with the Pankti, Indra with the Triştubh, the Visvedevâh with the Jagati. The two verses (where the joining of the gods to their metres is mentioned) commencing, Agner Gayatri abhavat (10, 130, 4-5) are then recited. 

The Kşattriya, who, after these deities (after having previously in Toked them in this manner) ascends his throne, obtains for himself the power not only of acquiring anything, but of keeping what he lias ac quired ;* his prosperity increases from day to day, and he will rule su preme over all his subjects.

When the priest is about to sprinkle hiin (with water) then he makes the king invoke the waters for their blessing (by these words) : “Look upon me, ye waters, with a favourable eye! touch my skin with your happy body! I invoke all the fires which reside in the waters to bestow on me splendour, strength, and vigour." For the waters, if not invoked for a blessing (by a mantra), take away the strength from (505) a Kşat triya who is already consecrated ; but not (if they have been duly invoked). 

(The Inauguration Mantra when the King is Sprinkled with the Holy Water. Whether the Sacred Words, " bhitr," do., are to be Pronounced, along with this Mantra or not. Different Opinions on this point.) 

They now put the branch of the Uduinbara tree on the head of the Kşattriya, and pour the liquids (which are in the large ladle) on it. (When doing so), the priest repeats the following mantras : "With these waters, which are most happy, which cure everything, increase the royal power, and hold up the royal power, the immortal Prajapati sprin kled Indra, Soma the king, Varuna, Yama, Manu; with the same, sprinkle I thee! Be the ruler over kings in this world. Thy illustrious mother bore thee as the great universal ruler over great men; the blessed mother has borne thee! By command of the divine Savitar I sprinkle? (thee) with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pûşan, with the lustre of Agni, the splendour of Sûrya, the power of Indra, that thou mayest obtain strength, happiness, fame, and food." 

If the priest, who sprinkles the king, wishes hin alone to enjoy good health, then be shall pronounce (when sprinkling) the sacred word, bhur. If he wishes that two inen (son and grandson) should enjoy this benefit together with him, then he shall pronounce the two sacred words, bhur, bhuvah. If he wishes to benefit in this way three men (son, grandson, and great grandson), or to make the king) un-(506) rivalled, then he ought to pronounce the three sacred words, blúr, bluvah, suar.

, Lit., that ho may eat food.

Some say, These sacred words having the power of bringing every thing within grasp, the Kşattriya who has the mantra recited with the addition of these sacred words, provides for another (not for himself); therefore, one should sprinkle him only under the recital of the mantra, " By command of the divine Savitar," &c. They, again, are of opinion that the Kşattriya, when sprinkled, not under the recital of the whole mantra (i.e., with omission of the sacred words), has power only over his former life. 

Satyakâma, the son of Jabalâ, said, “If they do not sprinkle him under the recital of these sacred words (in addition to the mantra), then he is able to go through his whole life (as much as is apportioned to bim)." But Uddálaka Aruņih said, “ He who is sprinkled under the recital of these sacred words obtains everything by conquest." 

He (the priest) should sprinkle him under the recital of the whole mantra, " By the command of the divine Savitar," &c., and conclude by bhûr, bhuvah, svar! 

The Ksattriya who has thus performed a sacrifice loses (in conse quence of his sacrifice) all these things (which were in him), viz., the Brahma which was placed in the Kşattra, the sap, nourishment, the essence of water and herbs, the character of holiness (brahmavarchasan), the thriving consequent on food, the begetting of children, and the peculiar form of the Kșattra (all that it comprises). And, as fur ther regards the sap for (producing) nourishing substances, the Kşattra is the protection of the herbs (the fields of grain, &c., being protected by the Kşattriyas, these things must be kept). If he there fore brings those two invocation offerings before the inaugur-[507] ation ceremony,'' then he places the Brahma in this Kşattra (and all those things will be consequently kept). 

(The Symbolical Meaning of the Different Implements and Liquids required 

for the Inauguration Ceremony. The Drinking of Spirituous Liquor (sura) by the King.) 

The reason that the throne-seat, the ladle, and the branch is of the Udumbara tree is because the Udumbara is vigour and a nourishing 

' Atisarvena, i.e., by what is beyond the whole mantra, that is, the sacred words, thûr, &c., which are added to it. 

1 Seo abovo 7, 22, one to the Bralıma, the other to the Kşattra: "I enter the Bralima, " &c.

substance. The priest thus places vigour in him (the "Kings) as his nourishing substance. 

As to curds, honey, and melted butter, they represent the liquid (essence) in the waters and herbs. The priest, therefore, places the essence of the waters and the herbs in him. 

The rain water fallen during sunshine, represents the splendour and lustre of sanctity, which are in this way placed in him. 

The young grass and young barley represent provisions and the thriving by their means, which are thus placed in him for (producing) offspring, and consequently (provide him with) offspring 

The spirituous liquor represents the Kşattra, and, further, the juice in the food; thus both the Kşattra and the juice in the food, are placed in him. 

The Dûrvâ grass is Kşattra; for this is the ruler of the herbs. The Kşattra, viz., the princely race, is represented by it, as it were, spread everywhere; the Kşattriya becomes residing here on this earth), in his kingdom, he becomes established, as it were, his rule extended, as it were. This is represented by the sprouts of the Dûrvâ, which have, (508) as it were, a firm footing on the earth. In this way, the Kşattra of the herbs is placed in him (the king) and a firm footing thus given him. 

All those things (the Brahma, sap, &e.), which had gone from the king after having performed a sacrifice, are in this way placed in him (again). By their (of curds, honey, &c.) means he makes him thus successful. 

Now he gives into his hand a goblet of spirituous liquor, under the recital of the verse, svâdişthayâ madişthayâ, &c. (9, 1, 1) i.e., "Purify, O Soma! with thy sweetest, most exhilarating drops (the sacrificer), thou who art squeezed for Indra, to be drink by him.''12 After having put the spirituous liquor into his hand, the priest repeats & propitiatory mantrals (which runs thus): "To either of you (spirituous liquor and Soma !) a separate residence has been prepared, and allotted by the gods. Do not mix with one another in the highest heaven; liquor! thou art powerful; Soma! thou art a king. Do not harm him (the king)! May either go to his own place." (Here is said), that the drinking of the Soma and that of liquor, exclude one another (they are not to be mixed). 

31 This interpretation is given by Sayana, which, no doubt, is suitablo to tho occasion at which this mantra is used ; and thus it certainly was interprelod evon in anciont times. Howover, it docs not appear to be tho original inoaning of tlio verse, 

12 Tt is with somo variations to be found in the Vajasanopi Saunhita (19, 7). 

350 

After having drunk it, he should think, "the giver (the priest) of the goblet (to be his friend) and give him (the remainder of) this (liquor)." This is the characteristic of a friend. Thus he finally places the liquor in his friend (gives him a share in it). And thus has he who possesses such a knowledge, a place in his friend (they are mutually connected). 

9. 

(509] (The Descent of the King from the Throne, after having been Inaugurated. The Mantras which he has to Repeat at this Occasion.) 

He now descends (from the throne-seat), facing the branch of the Udumbara tree (which was placed in the ground). The Udumbara being sap, and consequently a nourishing substance, the king goes thus (to receive) these gifts (hidden in the Udumbara tree). Being seated above, and having put both his feet on the ground, he announces his descent (facing the Udumbara), (by uttering the following words :) "I stand in the heavens, and on the earth; I stand in the air exhaled and inhaled; I stand on day and night; I stand on food and drink; I stand on Brahma, Kşattra, and these three worlds." Finally, he stands firmly through the universal soul (sarva-atmâ, which connects all the things just mentioned), and thence has a firm footing in the universe. He obtains continuous prosperity. The king who descends, after having been inaugurated by the ceremony of Panarabhişeka in this way (from the throne-seat), obtains supremacy over his subjects, and royal power. 

After having descended,'' he then stands, inclining his body (upastham kritvậ) with his face towards the east, and utters thrice the words, " Adoration to the Brahma !" Then he says aloud, “I present a gift for the attainment of victory (in general), of victory everywhere (abhijiti), of victory over strong and weak enemies (vijiti), and of complete victory (sanjiti)." [510] By thus making thrice salutation to the Brahma, the Kşattra comes under the sway of the Brahma, and consequently the rule of the king becomes prosperous, and he will have issue. As regards (the mantra), “ I present a gift for the attainment of victory,” &c., he emits Speech by it. For the words, "I give,” imply that Speech is conquered, (recovered, after having been silent). 

" When Speech is recovered, then (consequently) all this my per formance shall be completed,” having (so thinking) emitted Speech, he approaches the Ahavaniya fire, and puts a stick into it, reciting, “Thou

. 

351 

art a wooden stick, become joined to the sharpness of senses and strength of the body, Svâhâ !” Finally, he succeeds thus in making himself sharpness of senses and valiant. After having put the stick into the fire, he walks three steps towards the east and north, (and addresses the step he is taking thus) : " Thou art the means of subduing the regions; ye (steps), make me capable of adoring (in the right manner) the gods; may I obtain my desires wished for and preserve what is granted to me, and safety," He now proceeds to the north-east, that is, to undo again a . defeat. Such is the meaning (they say). 

10. (Magical Performance of a king for Defeating an Enemy) - The Devas and Asuras were fighting in these worlds. They fought in the eastern direction, then the Asuras defeated them. They then fought in the southern direction, and the Asuras defeated them again; and, likewise, they were defeated by the Asuras when fighting in the western and northern directions. They were then fighting between the eastern and northern directions, and remained victors. The [511] Ksattriya, therefore, standing amidst both armies arrayed in battle lines, shall proceed to the northeast, saying to him to the house priest)," do so 14 that I may conquer this army." After he (the house priest) has consented, he should touch the upper part of the king's chariot and repeat the mantra, tanaspate vidvângo Tri (6, 47, 26). Then he shall say to (the king), “Turn towards this (north-east) direction ; thy chariot with all its implements should be turned thither (north-east) ; tten to the north-West, south and east, and (lastly) towards the enemy." With the hymn, abhivartena havişå (10, 174) shall be turn his chariot, and when reciting the Apratiratha (10, 103 ásun sisâno) Sâså (1, 152 sâsa itthâ), and Sauparna (pra dhård yantu madhuna) hymns, he shall look upon it (the chariot). 

The Kşattriya conquers (the hostile) army, when he, at the time of just being about fighting (with the enemy), takes thus his refuge (with the house-priest), saying, “Make me win this battle.” He then shall let 

14 say, refers this address to the king who is sitting in his chariot. A Kşattriya is speaking these words. He asks first the king's permission to perform the cere mony mentioned. The person to whom the Kşattriya addresses his words, is only hinted at by the demonstrative pronoun, but never explicitly mentioned. I think it refers to the Purohita or housc-priest, who has always to accompany the king when going to fight a battle, ard give him þis adpice. Sayana's opinion is hardly correcteلوله

him fight in the north-eastern direction, and he (the Kşattriya) wins the battle. If he be turned out of his dominions, and thus takes his refuge with him (the house-priest), saying, “Make me return to my do minions," then he (the house-priest) shall let him, when going away, proceed to this (north-eastern) direction, (and) thus he recovers his dominions. 

(The king, whose inauguration ceremony is performed) after having been standing (in northeastern direction) recites then, when going [512] to his palace, (the verse) calculated to drive away all enemies altogether. (This verse is), apa prâcha (10, 131 1.) Then he will be made rid of all his enemies and live in safety, and enjoy happiness increasing from day to day. He who returns to his palace whilst reciting the above-mentioned mantra (10, 131, 1) obtains sovereignty over his subjects, and supreme power. After having come home, he sits behind the household fire. His priest then, after having touched him, fills a goblet four times with melted butter, and makes thus three (each consisting of four spoonfuls) offerings addressed to Indra, the mantras being recited in the Prapada 18 form, in order that he might be protected from disease, injury from any loss, and enjoy perfect safety.

(The Repetition of Three, Mantras, with Insertion of a certain Formula. Its Effect. Janmejaya's Opinion on the Effect of this Magical Performance.) 

(The verses to be recited in the Prapada way follow) Paryû şu pradhanva (9, 110, 1), i.e., acquire everywhere riches, in order to grant them (to tby worshipper). In the midst of the word, vritrâni (of the just mentioned mantra), after &, and before ni, be inserts the words, “bher, brahma, pranam (breath), amritam (ambrosia) is such one (the name is required) [513] who seeks for shelter and safety, for welfare with his child ren and cattle.” (Now follows the remaining part of the verse), ni sakşanir,

Richy adaya yanam eteşâm prapadan tad vidur budhah, i. e., the wise call that recital of the (several) padas of a Rik verse prapada, when they all are measured by the syllables of which they consist. This means that each syllable of the pada is to be pronounced quite distinctly, and that there should be 2 stop at the end of each påda. This explanation appears, however, not to be quite correct. From the following paragraph, we learn that prapada is the insertion of my formula in a pada of a verse. 

353 

&c. 1.C., being a conqueror of enemies, thou makest efforts of crossing the lines of our adversaries. 

(Now follows the second verse), Anu hi tui sutam, &e. (9, 110, 2). In the midst of the word, samarya, in the second pâda, after the syllable "ma," the words, bhuvo, brahma, &c. (the remainder just as above) are inserted. 

(Now follows the third verse), ajtjano hi pavamáno, &c. (9, 110, 3), In the midst of the word, salemanâ, after sa and before mi, he inserts the words, svar, brahma, &c. (just as above). After the last word of the interpolation, viz., “paśubhir," he then proceeds to finish the verse re commencing by kmand. 

The Kşattriya, for whose benefit the house-priest sacrifices three offerings of melted butter, each consisting of four spoonfuls, whilst recit ing these Indra verses in the above-mentioned Prapada way, thus becomes free of disease, free of enemies, does not suffer any loss, and, screened by the form of the three-fold science (the three Vedas), walks in all directions, and becomes established (after his death) in Indra's world. 

Finally, he prays for increase in cows, horses, and progeny, with the words, "Cows, may ye be born here ! horses, may ye be born here ! men, may ye be born here! may here sit a hero (my son), as protector (of the country), who presents the priests gifts, consisting of a thousand (cows)." He who thus prays, will be blessed with plenty of children and cattle. 

The Kşattriya, whom those (priests) wlio have this knowledge make sacrifice in such a way, will be raised to an exalted position. But those who make the king sacrifice in this way, without possessing this knowledge, they kill him, drag him away, and deprive (514) him of his property, as the most degraded of men (rzişâdas), robbers, murderers, seize a wealthy man (when travelling) in a forest, and, after having thrown him into a ditch, run away with his property. 

Janamejaya, the son of Parikşit, who possessed this knowledge, said, "My priests, who possess this knowledge, made me sacrifice, I who have the same knowledge (in such a manner). Therefore. I am victorious; I conquer a hostile army eager for fighting ;'neither the divine nor the human arrows coming from such an army can reach me. I shall attain the full age allotted to man (100 years), I shall become master of the whole earth. The same falls to the lot of him, who knowing this, is made to sacrifice (by priests) in this way.

THIRD CHAPTER (The Molâbhiseko or Grand Inaugurution Cervui'ney of Indra.) 

12. (The Elevation of Indra to the Royalty over the Gods. His Throne-scat. 

By what blantrus ke Ascended it. The Gods Proclaim him as King by mentioning all his Titles.) 

Now follows the great inauguration (mahabhişcka) of Indra. The gods, headed by Prajapati, said to one another (pointing with their hands to Indra) : “ This one is among the gods the most vigorous, most strong, most valiant, most perfect, who carries best out any work (to be done). Let us iostal him to the kingship over us).” They all consented to (515) perform just this ceremony (mahâbhişeka) on Indra. They brought for him that throne-seat, which is called the Rik-formed. They made the Brihat and Rathantara verses its two forelegs, the Vairûpa and Vairâja verses its hind-legs, the Sakvara and Raivata (verses) its, top boards,'the Náudhasa and Kaleya its side-boards. The Rik verses were made the threads of the texture which went lengthwise, the Samans were the threads which went crossways, the Yajus verses the intervals in the texture. They made (the goddess of) Glory its covering, and (the goddess of) Fortune its pillow, Savitar and Brilaspati were holding its two fore legs, Váyu and Pûşan the two hind-legs, Mitra and Varuņa the two top-boards, the Asvins the two side-boards. 

Indra then ascended the throne-seat, addressing it thus: "May the Vasus ascend thee with the Gâyatrî metre, with the Trivsit Stoma, withi the Rathautara Sâma. After them I then asceud for obtaining universal sovereignty. May the Rudras ascend thee with the Triştubh metre, the fifteen-fold Stoma, and the Brihat Sâma. After them then I ascend for obtaining increase of enjoyment. May the Adityas ascend thee with the Jagatî metre, the seventeen-fold Stoma, and the Vairûpa Sâma. After them I ascend for obtaining independent rule. May the Viśve Devål ascend thee with the Anustubh metre, the tirenty-one-fold Stoma, and the Vaira ja Sâma. After them I ascend for obtaining distinguished i ule. May the divine Sådhyâs and Aplyas ascend thee with the Pankti metre, the Tyinava (twenty-seven-fold) Stoma, and the Sâkvara Såma. After them I ascend for obtaining royal power. May the divine Marutas and

355 

Angiras ascend thee with the Atichandas metre, the thirty-three-fold Stoma, and the Raivata Sâma. After (516] tliem, then, I ascend for obtaining the fulfilment of the highest desires for becoming a great king, for supreme mastership, independence, and a long residence. By these words, one should ascend the throne-seat. 

After Indra had seated himself on this throne-seat, the Visre Devâh said to him, " Indra cannot achieve any feat if he is not everywhere publicly proclaimed? (as bero); but if he be thus proclaimed, he can do so." They then consented to do so, and consequently, turning towards Indra, cried aloud (calling him by all his titles.) 

The gods bestowed on him (Indra), by proclaiming him as "univer sal ruler," universal rule; by proclaiming him as "enjoyer (of plea sures)," they made him father (of pleasures); by proclaiming him as "inde pendent ruler," thoy granted him independence of rule; by proclaiming him as " distinguished king," they conferred on him royal distinction ; by proclaiming him “king," they made him father of kings; by calling bim“ one who has attained the highest desires," they granted him fulfil ment of the highest desires. 

(The gods then continued proclaiming his heroic virtues in the following manner): “ The Kşattra is born; the Kşattriya is born ; the supreme master of the whole creation is born ; the devourer of the (hostile) tribes is born; the destroyer of the hostile castles is born; the slayer of the Asuras is born; the protector of the Brahma is born ; the protector of the religion is born." 

After (his royal dignity) was thus proclaimed, Prajapati, when being just about performing the inauguration ceremcny, recited over him (consecrated him with the following mantra : 

13. [517](The Mantras by which Indra was Consecrated. The was Installed by Prajapati.) 

“Varuna, the faithful, sat down in his premises--for obtaining. universal rule, enjoyment of pleasures), independence, distinction as sovereign, fulfilment of the highest desires-be, the wise, &c.," (1, 25, 10). Prajapati, standing in front of Indra who was sitting on the throne seat, turned his face to the west, and, after having put on his head a gold leaf, sprinkled him with the moist branch of an Udumbara, together with that of a Palasa troe, reciting the three Rik verses, imá âpah sivatama,

i e., these most happy waters, &c. (Ait. Br. 8, 7); and the Yajus verse, derasya trâ (Vîjasan. Sanh. 1, 10. Ait Br. 8, 1); and the great words, bhúr, bhuvah, svar. 

14. 

Indra Inaugurated by Various Deities in the Various Directions to the 

Kingship, becomes Universal Ruler. The Vasavas then inaugurated him (Indra) in the eastern direction, during thirty-one days, by these three Rik verses, the Yajus verse, and the great words (all just mentioned), for the sake of obtaining universal sovereignty. Hence all kings of eastern nations, in the eastern regions, aie inaugurated to universal sovereignty, and called samraj, i.e., uni versal sovereign, after this precedent made once by the gods. 

Then the Rudras inaugurated Indra in the southern region, during thirty-one days, with the three Rik verses, the Yajus and the great words (just mentioned), for obtaining enjoyment (of pleasures). Hence all kings of living creatures (chiefly beasts) in the southern region are inaugurated for the enjoyment (of pleasures) and called . bloja, i.e., enjoyer. * [518] Then the divine Adityas inaugurated him in the western region, during thirty-one days, with those three Rik verses, that Yajus verse, and those great words, for obtaining independent rule. Hence all kings of the Nichyas and Apåchyas in the western countries, are inau gurated to independent rule, and called "independent rulers." 

Then the Visve Devâh inaugurated him during thirty-one days, in the northern region, by those three Rik verses, &c. for distinguished rule. Hence all people living in northern countries beyond the Himalaya, such as the Uttarakurûs, Uttaramadras, are inaugurated for living with out a king (vairajyam), and called Virâj,3 i.e. without king. 

Then the divine Sadhyas and Aptyas inaugurated Indra, during - thirty-one days, in the middle region, which is a firmly established foot ing (the immovable centre) to the kingship (râjya). Hence the kings of the Kurúpañchâlas, with the Vasas and Usinaras, are inaugurated to kingship, and called Kings (rdja). . To this word two meanings can be given : 1 (without king;) 2 a very distinguished king. In this passage, we must take it in the first meaning; for here are janapadal, 2.e, people in opposition to the king mentioned, as abhişikta, i.e., inaugurated, whilst in all other passages of this chapter, we find instead of them, the rájánah or kings. 

357 

Then the divine Marutas and Angiras inaugurated him, during thirty one days, in the upper (urdhva) region, for attaining fulfilment of the highest wishes, the position of a great king, of a supreme ruler, of an independant king, and long duration of his rule. 

Indra thus became, by means of this great inauguration ceremony, possessed of the power of obtaining anything wished for, as had been only the prerogative of Prajapati.' He conquered in all the various ways [519] of possible conquest, and won all people. He obtained the leader ship, precedence, and supremacy over all gods. After having conquered the position of a samråj (universal ruler), &c., he became in this world self-existing (svayambhún), an independent ruler, immortal, and, in the heaven-world, after having attained all desires wished for, he became immortal (also).

FOURTH CHAPTER. (The Mahabhiseka Ceremony Performed on a King. What Rigis 

Performed it, and for what Kings they Performed it.) 

15. (The Consequences of the Malabluseka, The Oath which the King must 

take Before the Priest Performs the Ceremony.) The priest who, with this knowledge (about the Mahâbhişeka ceremony), wishes that a Kşattriya should conquer in all the various ways of conquest, to subjugate all people, and that he should attain to leadership, precedence, and supremacy over all kings, and attain every where and at all times to universal sovereignty, enjoyment (of pleasures), independence, distinguished distinction as king, the fulfilment of the highest desires, the position of a king, of a great king, and supreme mastership, that he might cross (with his arms) the universe, and become the ruler of the whole earth during all his life, which may last for an infinitely long time, that he might be the sole king of the earth up to its (520) shores bordering on the ocean ; such a priest should inaugurate the Kşattriya with Indra's great inauguration ceremony. But, before doing so, the priest must make the king take the following oath : " What 

* This whole sentence is only a translation of the full import implied in the words, parameşti prästipatya. 

• Lit, ho conquered all the conquests (jitis, i.l., abhijiti, vijiti, sarnjiti, &c. See above) HIcro Sayana explains it as"long-lived," 

358 

erer pious works thou mightest have done during the time which may elapse from the day of thy birth to the day of thy death, all these, together with the position, thy good deeds, thy life, thy children, I would wrest from thee, shouldest thou do me any harm.” 

The Kşattriya, then, who wishes to attain to all this, should well consider and say in good faith all that is above-mentioned (thou mayest Wrest from me, &c., &e.) 

16. 

(The Woods and Grains Required for the Performance of Mahabhineka.) 

The priest then shall say (to his attendants), “ Bring four kinds of Food: Nyagrodha, Udumbara, Asvattha, and Plakşa." Among the trees, the Nyagrodha is the Kşattra. Thus, by bringing Nyagrodha wooil, he places in the king the Kşattram, the Udumbara representing the enjoyment, the Asvattha universal sovereignty, the Plaksa independence and freedom of the rule of another king. The priest, by having these woods brought to the spot, thus makes the king participate in all these qualities (universal sovereignty, &c., kc.). Next he shall order to bring four kinds of grain from vegetables (auşadha tokmakrita), viz., rice with small grains, rice with large grains, Priyangu, and barley. Tor, amongst herbs, rice with small grains represents the Kşattra. Thus, by bringing sprouts of such grains, he (521] places the Kşattra in him. Rice with large grains represents universal sovereignty. Therefore, by bringing sprouts of such grains (to the spot), he places universal sovereignty in him. The Priyangus, among herbs, represent enjoyment of pleasures, By bringing their sprouts, he places the enjoyment of pleasures in him. Barley represents the skill as military commander. By bringing their sprouts, he places such a skill in him (the king). 

17. (The Implements for Making Mahabhisckc.) Now they bring for him a throne-seat made of Udumbara wood, of which the Brâhmaṇam has been already toid (see 8, 8). The ladle of Udumbara wood is here optional ; instead of it, a vessel of the same wood (pâtrí) may be taken. Besides, they bring an Udumbara branch. Then they mix those four kinds of fruit and grain in a vessel, and, after having poured over them curds, honey, clarified butter, and rain-water fallen

woo 

during sunshine, put it down. He (the priest) should then consecrate the throne-seat in the following way: "thy two forelegs are the Brihat and Rathantaram Sâmans, &c. (just as above, see 8, 12). 

18=18, and 19=14. 

20. (The Meaning and Effect of the Various Liquids Poured over the Head of 

the King. His Drinking of Spiritulous Lilor. He drinks the Sona Mystically.) 

By sprinkling the king with curds, the priest makes his senses sharp ; for curds represent sharpness of senses in this world. By sprinkling him with honey, the priest makes him vigourous; for honey is the vigour in herbs and trees. By sprinkling him with clarified butter, he bestows upon him splendour; for (522] clarified butter is the brightness of cattle. By sprinkling him with water, he makes him free from death (immortal); for waters represent in this world the drinking of immortality (amrita). 

The king who is thus inagurated, should present to the Brahman who bas inaugurated him gold, a thousand cows, and a field in form of a quadrangle. They say, however, that the amount of the reward is not limited and restricted to this it may be much higher), for the Kşat triya (1.c., his power) has no limits, and to obtain unlimited (power, the reward should, as to its greatness, be unlimited also). 

Then tlie priest gives into his hands a goblet filled with spirituous liquor, repeating the mantra, svå disthayâ, &c. (see 8, 8). He then should drink the remainder (after previuos libation to the gods), when repeating the following two mantras: "Of what juicy, well-prepared beverage Indra drank with lis associates, just the same, viz., the king Soma, I drink hcre, with my mind being devoted to Lim (Soma).” The second mantra (Rigveda, 8, 45, 22), "To thee who growest like a bullock (Indra), by drinking Soma, I send off (the Soma juice), which was squeezed, to drink it; may it satiate thee and make thee well drunk." 

The Soma beverago which is (in a mystical way) contained in the spirito nous liquor, is thus druok by the king, who is inaugurated by means of Indra's geat inauguration ceremony (the ceremony just described), and 1100 the spirituous liquor.(After having drunk this mystical Soma) le should

repeat the [523] following mantras, apáma Somam (8, 48, 3), 1.c., we have drunk, Soma, and san no bhava (10, 37, 10), i.e., Be it propitious to us! 

The drinking of spirituous liquor, or Soma, or the enjoyment of some other exquisite food, affects the body of the Kşattriya who is inaugur ated by means of Indra's great inauguration ceremony, just as pleasantly and agreeably till it falls down (on account of drunkenness), as the son feels such an excess of joy when embracing his father, or the wife when embracing her husband, as to lose all self-command. 

21. (What Kings had the Mahabhişeka Ceremony Performed; their Conu quest of the Whole Barth, and the Horse Sacrifices. Stanzas on Janamo jaya, Viśvakarma and Marutta.) 

Tura, the son of Kavaşa, inaugurated with this great inauguration ceremony of Indra, Janamejaya, the son of Parikşit. Thence Janame jaya went everywhere conquering the earth, up to its ends, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse. To this fact refers the following Gâtha (stanza), which is sung : "In the land where the throne-seat was erected, Janame jaya bound a horse, which was eating grain, adorned with a mark on its forehead (rukmin), and with yellow flower garlands, which was walking over the best (fields full of fodder), for the gods." 

With this ceremony, Sarayâta, the son of Manu, was inaugurated by Chyavana, the son of Bhrigu. Thence Sâryâta went conquering all over the earth, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse, and was even, at the sacrifici. al session held by the gods, the house-father. 

With this ceremony, Samasuşmâ, the son of Vâjaratna, inaugurated Satânika, the son Satrajît. [524] Thence Satânika went conquering every where over the whole earth, up to its ends, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse.

(Continuation of the Preceding. Stanzas on tho Liberality of Anga, Udamaya, and Virochana.) 

With this ceremony, Udamaya, the son of Atri, inaugurated Anga. Thence Anga went conquering everywhere over the whole earth, up to its ends, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse. This Anga, who was not defective in any respect (thence called alopanga), had once said, "I give thee, O Brahman, ten thousand elephants, and ten thousand slave girls, if you call me to this (thy) sacrifice.”'s Regarding them, the follow ing (five) stanzas (ślokas) were sung i 

(1) " Whatever cows the sons of Priyamedhas had ordered (Uda maya to give in the midst of the sacrifice at the midday libation), the Atri-son (Udamaya) at each time presented two thousand Badvas. 

(2) “ The son of Virochana loosened eighty-eight thousand white horses from their strings, and presented those, which were fit for drawing a carriage, to the sacrificing Purohita.” 

(3) "The son of Atri presented ten thousand girls, well endowed with ornaments on their necks, who had been gathered from all quarters." 

* The king had promised the whole earth as gift to his officiating priest. 

• Udamaya, the son of Atri, was at this time himself the sacrificer. The Priyamedhas were his ofliciating priests. 

* A Badva is, according to Sâyana, 100 kotis, i e., a billion. But I doubt very much whether this is the original meaning of badva. It is perhaps related to the Zend baévare. which means “ ten thousand." 

7 This Sloka does not refer to king Aiga. 

20362 

(4) The son of Atri, having given ten thousand elephants in the country Avachatnuka, the Brahman [526] (Atri's son) being tired, desired his servante (to take charge) of Aiga's gift." 

(5) " (From "saying) I give thee a hundred (only), I give thee a hundred, 'he got tired ; (thence) he said, I give thee a thousand, and stopped often in order to breathe, for there were too many thousands to be given." 

23. (Continuation. Stanzos on the Liberality of Bharata. Story of Satya havya, who was Created out of his Reward by the King Atyarati.) 

With this ceremony, Dirghatamas, the son of an unmarried woman, inaugurated Bharata, the son of Duşyanta. Thence Bharata went conquering everywhere over the whole earth, up to its ends, and sacrificed those horses which were fit for being sacrificed. Regarding this event, the following stanzas are sung: 

(1) Bharata presented one hundred and seven Badvas (large flocks) of elephants,& of a dark complexion, with white teeth, all decked with gold, in the country Maşnára. 

(2) At the time when Bharata, the son of Duşyanta constructed a sacred hearth in the country of) Sachiguna, the Brahmans got distri buted flocks of cows by thousands. 

(3) Bharata, the son of Dusyanta, bound seventy-eight horses (for being sacrificed) on the banks of the Yamuná, and fifty-five on the Ganga for Indra. 

(4) The son Duşyanta, after having bound (for sacrificing) one hundred and thirty-three horses (527), overcame the stratagems of his royal enemy, by means of the superiority of his own stratagems. 

(5) The great work achieved by Bharata, neither the forefathers achieved it, nor will future generations achieve it, (for it is as impossible to do it) as any mortal, belonging to the five divisions of mankind, ? can touch with his hands the sky. 

& Mriga in Sanscrit. Sây. says, that elephants are to be understood here. Mriga appears to be a general term for a wild beast. 

* Vritraghne, Sây. takes it, however, as name of a country, for which I see, however, no reason. 

70 Pañcha månaväh, Say. explains the four castes, with the Nişadas as the fifth. But I am rather inclined to take the word in the sense of pañchakrişti, or pañchakşiti, i ens five tribes frequently mentioned in the Saraahita. It then denotes the whole human race, including the superior beings. See page 214.

The Rişi Brihad Uktha communicated this great inauguration cere mony to Durmukha, the Pañchâla. Thence Durmukha, who was no king, being possessed of this knowledge, went conquering everywhere over the whole earth, up to its ends, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse. 

The son of Satyahavya, of the Vasistha Gotra, communicated this ceremony to Atyarâti, the son of Janantapaya. Thence Atyarâti, who was no king, being possessed of such a knowledge, went conquering every where over the whole earth, up to its end, and sacrificed the sacrificial horse. 

The son of Satyahavya, of the Vasiştha Gotra, then told (the king), “Thou hast (now) conquered the whole earth up to the shore of the sea ; let me obtain now greatness (as reward for my services)." Atyarâti an swered, "When, O Brahmana, I shall have conquered the Uttara Kurus,? 1 then thou shalt be king of the earth , and I will be thy general.” The son of Satyahavya said, “This is the land of the gods, no mortal can conquer it. Thou hast cheated me; therefore I take all this (from thee)." Atyarati, after having been thus deprived of his powers and majesty, was slain by the victorious king Suşmina, 528] the son of Sibya. Thence a Kşattriya should not cheat a Brahman who has this knowledge and per formed this (inauguration) ceremony, unless he wishes to be turned out of his dominions, and to lose his life. 


### 05
FIFTH CHAPTER. (On the Office of the Purohitae, or House-priest. The Brahmanan Parimara, i. e., Dying Around the Brahma..) 

24 (The Necessity for a King to Appoint a House-priest. In what Way the King Keeps the Sacred Fires. How to Appease the Five 

Destructive Powers of Agni). Now, about the office of a Purohita (house-priest). The gods do not eat the food offered by a king who has no bouse-priest (Purohita). Thence the king even when (not) intending to bring a sacrifice, should appoint a Brahman to the office of house-priest. 

· The king who (wishes) that the gods might eat his food, has, after having appointed a Purohita, however, the use of the (sacred) fires (with out having actually established them) which lead to heaven; for the Purohita is his Ahavaniya fire, his wife the Gârbapatya, and his son the 

u In the north of the Himalaya.Sây. 

364 

Dažşina fire. When he does (anything) for the Purohita, then he sacri fices in the Abavaniya fire (for the Purohita represents this fire). When he does (anything) for his wife, then he verily sacrifices in the Garha patya fire. When he does (anything) for his son, then he verily sacrifices in the Dakşiņa fire. These fires (which are led by the Purohita) which are thus freed from their destructive power? (for the Kşattriya, i.e., [529] they do not burn him), carry, pleased by the wish for sacrificing," the Kşattriya to the heaven-world, and (make him obtain) the royal dignity, bravery, a kingdom, and subjects to rule over. But, if the Kşattriya has no wish for sacrificing (by not appointing a Purohita), then the fires get displeased with him, and being not freed from their destructive power, throw him out of the heaven-world (and deprive him) of the royal dignity, bravery, his kingdom, and subjects over whom he rules. 

This Agni Vaisyanara, which is the Purohita, is possessed of five destructive powers ;8 one of them is in his speech, one in his feet, onein his skin, one in his heart, and one in the organ of generation. With these (five) powers, which are burning and blazing, he (Agni) attacks the king. 

By saying, "Where, * O master, hast thou been residing (for so long a time)? Servants, bring (kusa) grass for him," the king propitiates the destructive power which is in Agni's speech. When they bring water for washing the feet, then the king propitiates the destructive power which is in Agni's feet. When they adorn him, then he propitiates by it the destructive power which is in Agni's skin. When they satiate him (with food), then the king propitiates the destructive power which is in Agni's heart. When Agni lives unrestrained (at ease) in the king's pre mises, then he propitiates the destructive power which is in Agni's organ of generation. Agni, then, if all the destructive powers which are in his body have been propitiated, and he is pleased by the king's wish [580] for sacrificing, conveys him to the heaven-worlds and (grants him) royal dignity, bravery, a kingdom, and subjects over whom he might rule. But should the king not do so, he will be deprived of all these gifts. 

25. (Agni Protects the King who Appoints a House-priest.) This Agni Vaiúvânara, who is the Purohita, is possessed of five des tructive powers. With them he surrounds the king (for his defence), just 

1 Literally, the bodies of which are appeased. 2 The king manifests his wish by appointing a Purohita. 3 They are called meni. Sây. explains paropadravakarini krodharûpå saktir. 

Agni, or his representative, the Purohita, is hero trcated as a guest.

as the sea surrounds the earth. The empire of such a ruler (@rya) will be safe. Neither will he die before the expiration of the full life term (100 years); but live up to his old age, and enjoy the full term appor tioned for his life. Nor will he die again (for he is free from being born again as a mortal), if he has a Brâhmaṇa who possesses such a know ledge as his Purohita, and guardian of his empire ; for he obtains by means (of his own) royal dignity that (for another, his son), and by means of his bravery that (of another). The subjects of such a king obey him unani mously and undivided. 

26. (The Importance of the Office of a Purohita Proved from Three Verses 

of a Vedic Hymn). To this power of the Purobita, a Rişı alludes' in the the following verses : sa id râjâ pratijanyani, &c. (4, 50, 7), i.e., the king defeated by his prowess and bravery all his adversaries. By janyáni are enemies and adversaries to be understood; he conquers them by means of his prowess and bravery. The other half of this verse is as follows) Birhaspatim yah subluritam bibhartig i. e., "who(the king) supports Brihaspati who is well to be supported." For Brihaspati is the [581] Purohita of the gods and him follow the Purobitas of the human kings. The words, “who supports Brihaspati who is well to be supported," therefore mean, who (what king) supports the Purohita who is well to be supported. By the words (the last quarter of the verse above mentioned) valgúyati vandate půrvabhajam, 

.e., he honours and salutes him who has the precedence of enjoyment (2.6., the Purohita), he-recommends his (the Purohita's) distinction. 

(In the first half of the following verse), sa it kşetti sudhita okasi sve (4, 50, 8), the idea is expressed, that he (the Purohita) lives in his own premises; the word okas means griha, 2. e., house, and the word sudhita is the same as suhita, i c., well-disposed, pleased. The second half of the verse) lasmâ ilâ pinvate višvadanin, i. e., food grows for him (the king who keeps a Purohita) at all times. Tļå here means anna, i e., food; such one (such a king) is always possessed of essential juice (for keeping the lifo again); his subjects bow before him. The subjects (the tribes) form kingdoms; kingdoms by themselves bow before such a king who is pre ceded (prirva eti) by a Brahma. Thus one calls him (such a Brâhmaņa) a Purohita. 

(The first quarter of the third verse 4, 50, 9 is as follows) apratito jayati sari dhandni, i, e., he (such a king) conquers realms without being 

opposed by enemies. By dhanani kingdoms are to be understood ; he conquers them without meeting any opposition. The second quarter of the verse is as follows) prati janyáni uta ya sajanya. By janyani are enemies and adversaries to be understood; he conquers them without meeting any opposition. (In the third quarter) avasyave yo varivah karoti, there is said, “who (what king) not being possessed of any wealth renders service (varivaḥ) to a very indigent (Purohita)." (In the last quarter of the verse) brahmane râjâ tam avanti devah, i.e., "if the king is [582] for the Brahman (if he support him), then the gods protect him (the king)” he speaks about the Purohita. 

27. The Three Divine Purohitas. Who is Fit for the Office of a Purohita. By Repeating of What Mantra and Performance, of What Ceremony the King has to Engage him.) 

The Brahman who knows the (following) three (divine) Purohitas, as well as the three appointers to this office, should be nominated to such a post. Agni is one of these (three) Purohitas; his appointer is the earth; the (other) Purohita is Vâyu, his appointer is the air; the (third) Purohita 

is Aditya, his appointer is the sky. Who knows this is (fit for the office + of a) Purohita; but he who does not know it, is unworthy of holding such 

an office. 

That king who appoints a Brahmaṇa who has this knowledge to be his Purohita and protector of his kingdom, succeeds in making (another) king his friend, and conquers his enemy. The king who does so, obtains by means of (his own) royal dignity that (for another), and by means of (his) bravery that for another (i. e., he defeats him). The subjects of such a king obey him unanimously and undivided. 

(Now Follows the Mantra for Appointing the Purohita). “Bhúr, Bhuvah, Svar, Om! I am that one, thou art this one ; thou art this one, I am that one; I am heaven, thou art the earth ; I am the Saman, thou art the Rik. Let us both find here our livelihood (support). Save us from great danger (just as was done) in former times; thou art (my) body, protect mine. All ye many herbs, of a hundred kinds, over which the king Soma rules, grant me (sitting) on this seat, uninterrupted hapi ness. All ye herbs ruled lsy [533] Soma the king, which are spread over the earth, grant me (sitting) on this seat, uninterrupted hapiness. I cause to sit in the kingdom this goddess of fortune. Thence I look upon 

367 

the divine waters (with which the king is washing the feet of the Purohita)." 

“By washing his (the Purohita's) right foot, I introduce wealth obtain ed by sharpness of senses into the kingdom; by washing his left foot, I make that sharpness of senses increase. I wash, O gods! the first (right) and second (left) foot for protecting my empire and obtaining safety for it. May the waters which served for washing the feet (of the Purohita) destroy my enemy!" 

28. 

(Spell to be Spoken and Applied by King to Kill his Enemies. Who First Communicated it.) - 

Now follows the ceremony called, "dying round the Brahma" (Brah manah parimara). All enemies and foes of him who knows this cere mony, die round about him. This Brahma is he who sweeps in the air, i.e., Vayu). Round him five deities are dying, viz., lightning, rain, moon, sun, fire. 

Lightning is absorbed by lightning when it does not rain, and is conse quently hidden (to our eyes). They do not perceive such a flash of light ning when it dies, and consequently disappears. When they do not see him (the enemy), he (the king) shall say, “With the death of lightning my enemy shall die, and disappear! May they never get aware of him !" Instantly, then, they do not perceive him (the enemy), for he will be killed. 

The rain when fallen is absorbed by the moon which disappears; they do not perceive it, when it dies and disappears. Then, when they do not (534) perceive him (the enemy), then he (the king) should say, " With the death of the rain, my enemy die and disappear. May they never get aware of him!" Instantly, then, they do not perceive him (the enem for he will be killed. 

The moon at the time of the new moon, is absorbed by the sun, &c. When they do not perceive him (the enemy) then the king) shall say, “With the death of the moon, my enemy shall die, and disappear. May they never get aware of him !" Instantly, then, they do not perceive him (the enemy), for he will be killed. 

The sun, when setting, is absorbed by Agni (fire), &c. The king then shall say, "With the death of the sun, my enemy shall die, and disappear ! 

OR AT

may they never get aware of bim!" Lustauls, thien, il y lo not perceive him (the enemy), for he will be killed. 

The fire when extinguishing, is absorbol hy that, siti The king thon shall say, “ With the death of the fire, ny enemy wall dio mnt 1-pear. May they never get aware of him!” Instantly, then, they do not percoivo him (the enemy), for he will be killed. 

These (five) deities are then born again. The fire is born out of Vayu (wind). For it is produced by friction ,!with great) furce, and restraining the breath.). After having seen the fire New born, tho king shall say, "May Agni be born, but may ny enemy not bo burn (again); may he go far off !” Then he goes far ofl. 

Out of fire the sun is born. Having soou him, the king shall say, "May the sun be born, but may my enemy not be born; muy ho go far off!” Then he goes far off. 

[535] From the sun the moon is born. IIaving soon it, the king shall say, "May the moon be born, but not my enerny, may lo bo far off !" Then he goes far off. 

From the moon the rain is born. Having soon it, tho king shall say, "May the rain be born, but not my enemy; may ho bo far off." Thou ho goes far off. 

From rain lightning is born. Having soen it, tho king shall say, "May lightning be born, but not my enemy; nay be bo (ur oll. Thon ho goes far off. 

This is the Brahmanah parinarah (dying around the Brahma). Mai treya, the son of Kuşáru, told it to Satvan, the son of Kirsi, a king of the Bharga Gotra. Five kings (who were his enemies) diod round him ; thence he attained to greatness. 

He who uses this spell, has to observe the following rules: IIo novor shall sit before his enemy has taken his seat. When he bolioves him to be standing, then he shall stand. He shall not lie down, beforo also his enemy has done so. When he thinks him sitting, then he shall sit him self. He never shall sleep before his enemy has fallen asleep. Wlien he believes him to be awake, then he shall also be awake. In this way, he puts his enemy down, even if he wears a stone-helmet (is well armed), 

*Tko production of fire by means of friction is very fatiguing, as I can assuro tho louca ; er, frou having tried it once with the proper apparatus, used at the sacrifices for this purpose
