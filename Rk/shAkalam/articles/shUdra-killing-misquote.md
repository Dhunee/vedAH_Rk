Was asked about a statement of Aitareya Brāhmaṇa according to which 'Śūdra can be beaten at will'. Although I am no expert on Brāhmaṇa texts, but I do care about the context in which things are said. The statement occurs in the 35th chapter. There, a Kṣatriya is being intensely discouraged from consuming 3 edible things during the ritual. This being the main topic, to discourage him it is said that if he consumes them, a non-Kṣatriya like offspring will be born in his family. 

- If he consumes Soma, a Brāhmaṇa like child will be born, who would be lacking in bravery, would beg for food, etc. It states that the Brāhmaṇa could be, at one's will, made to leave the premises he enters. 
- Similarly, if he consumes curd, a Vaiśya like child will be born. Vaiśya is shown as the one who can be overpowered by another King, and he asks requests others for the sake of his business, etc. 
- Similarly if he consumes water, a Śūdra like offspring will be born in his lineage. It is at this point that 'yathā-kāma-vadhyaḥ' has been used. 

> 'yathā-kāma-vadhyaḥ' was not an imperative command but a descriptive statement wrt ground reality for others vis-a-vis kṣatriyas. - GA
