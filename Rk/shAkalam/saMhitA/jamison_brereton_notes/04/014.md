Agni or various divinities


## 01
The opening of the verse, práty agnír uṣásaḥ, matches that of 13.1 práty agnír uṣásām, though the difference in case of the dawn words signals that the verses will veer in slightly different directions. Both also share the verb akhyat, but in 13.1 it ends the first pāda, while in 14.1 it opens the 2nd pāda (accented ákhyat).

The 2nd half vss. of the two hymns deviate more, though both concern the Aśvins and contain the verb yātam (accented yātám in 13.1c). Sūrya (13.2d) is absent from 14.1.


## 02
The first pādas of these two vss. are identical, save for the near synonyms bhānúm (13.2) and ketúm (14.2), which take 2nd position. The rest of the verses go their own ways, though Sūrya appears in the final pādas of both.


## 03
Though both 13.3 and 14.3 contain horse imagery and the verb √vah ‘convey’, they are otherwise quite distinct, with Dawn the topic of 14.3.


## 04
The splv. váhiṣṭha- in the pl. is found in both 13.4 and 14.4; the verb of motion is yāsi in 13.4 and vahantu in 14.4.

The referent of the 2nd du. must be the Aśvins (so also Old [SBE], WG, pace Re, who supplies Agni and Dawn). Though they are unnamed, the near identity of pāda b with IV.45.2b in an Aśvin hymn makes this identification most likely, esp.

since soma and honey are the drinks of choice of the Aśvins.


## 05
Identical to 13.5.
