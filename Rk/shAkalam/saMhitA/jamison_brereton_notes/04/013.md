Agni or various deities

In c the other Ādityas, or at least Aryaman, should be supplied, since the verb (yanti) is plural and there are only two expressed subjects (váruṇaḥ … mitráḥ).


## 03
I take the Ādityas as the subj. of ákṛṇvan, since the Sun is their spy (see pāda d). It could also be, more generally, the gods, as Old (SBE), Ge, and Re take it.

In any case it is certainly not the other pl. entity mentioned in cd, the seven golden mares.


## 04
This vs. contains images drawn from the techniques of everyday life: tanning (cd) and sewing (ab). The lexeme ví √hṛ in pāda a with its object tántu- ‘thread, web’ has been differently interpreted, nor surprisingly since we don’t have good evidence for such technical vocabularies. I interpr. it as ‘take apart, unravel’, in part because of vipṛ́ce ‘pull apart’ in the previous vs. (Sim. Thieme, Unters., 17.) Others, using different values for ví, interpr. the idiom as ‘spread out’ (Old, SBE) or ‘alternate (threads [=the dark threads of night and the bright ones of day])’ (Ge, WG).


## 05
The question “how does the sun not fall?” is implicitly answered by pāda d: he’s really a fixed pillar, not an unmoored orb in the sky. But this ignores the presupposition to the question in c: “with what power does he journey?” -- since a pillar doesn’t journey. So, despite the apparent reassurance of d, the issues remain unresolved.
