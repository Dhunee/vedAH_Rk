Although by the time of the composition of this hymn the word play may have long been buried, for Indo-Europeanists the juxtaposition of *-Hner and *gw enH (man and woman) (sūnárī jánī) is very cute.

Note the distraction of the usual “daughter of heaven” phrase into a threetermed alliterative phrase divó adarśi duhitā́. ## 053 Savitar


## 02
With urú we can supply rájaḥ from 3a, where rájāṃsi occurs as the obj. of the same verb ā́√prā, or antárikṣam, the most common noun found with this neut.

adj. and found in this phrase at the end of the immediately preceding hymn, IV.52.7b antárikṣam urú.

As Ge’s parallels show, this must be Savitar’s own ślóka.

The dat. svā́ya dhármaṇe would be easier to parse as “for his own support.” Both Ge and Re are rather cavalier about the dat. here. Ge tr. ‘nach’; Re claims it’s no different from the instr., further stating “indecision des cases obliques dans ce type de noms,” which seems like a dangerous interpretive principle to me.

In cd I take sávīmani with the participles of d. In that pāda aktúbhiḥ ‘through the nights’ strictly speaking goes with niveśáyan ‘causing to settle down’.


## 06
The participles niveśáyan prasuván are reprised here as agentives prasavitā́ nivéśanaḥ.
