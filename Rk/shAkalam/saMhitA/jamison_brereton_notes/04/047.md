Vāyu and Indra As in the preceding hymn, vs. 1 is addressed only to Vāyu, with single voc., but the rest of the vss. address them jointly, in three different ways. In 2a we have a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction índraś ca vāyo, in 3a the same construction in normal order, and in 4d the dual dvandva voc. índravāyū found in 46.3-7.


## 03
Of the two pāda-final qualifiers, śuṣmínā (a) and śavasas patī (b), the first is nom., the 2nd voc. It is not clear to me why, since, save for the accent, nom. and voc. would be identical.


## 04
The qualifier of the teams, puruspṛ́haḥ ‘craved by many’, reprises 1d spārháḥ, used of Vāyu, again a faint sign of ring composition. For the syntax see comm. ad VI.60.8.
