The 1st persons naḥ and madryàk are somewhat awkwardly doubled. With Ge I take naḥ, found in (modified) Wackernagel’s Position in pāda a, with sómapītaye in b, and madryàk ‘in my direction’ with the verb of motion in c.

It is curious that the impv. mandasvā is not accented in this clause, despite the hí, nor is it in the identical vs. VI.45.27 or in VI.23.8 also with sá mandasvā hí ...

I have no explantation; Old notes the lack of accent and gives a ref. to his treatment in ZDMG 60, but in fact there he does nothing more there than note the passages.

## 07
The 1st pl. them. jarāmahe is perfectly ambiguous between ‘(be) awake’ and ‘sing’, and all other tr. assign it to ‘awake’ -- incl. WG, though Gotō (1st class, 154) assigns it with certainty to ‘sing’. I have also tr. as ‘sing’, though nothing is at stake between the two renderings.


## 08
Most take hári-priya- as ‘loving the hári’ (e.g., Re “qui aimes les alezans”); I have reversed the direction of affection: “dear to the fallow bays,” primarily because better attested puru-priyá- means ‘dear to many’ not ‘loving many’, though the accent difference between them may signal a difference in meaning. (However, the special accentual behavior of compounded puru- muddies the waters.)
