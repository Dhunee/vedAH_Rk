Indra I have endeavored to preserve in tr. the consistent position of índra- in each vs., for which see the publ. intro. Other elements have had to be juggled; as is often the case, it is harder to honor the half-verse division in Gāyatrī than in trimeter.


## 01
On the retroflex in pṛtanāṣā́hya- see comm. ad IX.88.7.

## 03-04
As Ge also suggests, Indra’s names (nā́māni) in vs. 3 form a complementary pair with his hundred dhā́man- ‘forms, embodiments’ in 4.


## 05
Given vā́jeṣu beginning vs. 6, vā́jasātaye would have better been tr. “to win prizes.”


## 06
And here a plural “when the prizes (are set)” would be more accurate.


## 07
The vs. contains 5 locatives, 4 of them plural, and so the issue -- though not a particularly pressing one -- is to sort out what goes with what. I have taken them pāda by pāda. Different tr. distribute them slightly differently.


## 09
On the indriyā́ṇi dispersed among the five peoples, see Proferes (2007: 65).

## 10
Note the alliteration in pāda b: dyumnáṃ dadhiṣva duṣṭáram.

The root √tṝ contributes two forms here: duṣṭáram (b) and úd … tirāmasi. It is difficult to convey their root connection in Engl.
