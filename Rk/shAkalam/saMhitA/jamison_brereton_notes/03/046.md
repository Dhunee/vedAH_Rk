## 01
This vs. is cunningly constructed, in that until the very last word of the third pāda it consists entirely of genitives with nothing to depend on; neut. pl. vīryā̀ṇi at the end of c breaks this string and provides the necessary grammatical support -- joined by the matching adj. mahā́ni at the very end of the vs. ### 03
All four pādas begin with prá; the verb of a, ririce, should be supplied with the other three pādas.

Note the phonological plays in a: prá (mā)trā(bhī) and ririce roca(mānaḥ).

## 04
The string of untethered accusatives in the first 3 pādas reminds us of the string of genitives in vs. 1. Here the syntactic tension is resolved only by the verb ā́ viśanti that ends the verse and allows the accusatives to serve as its goal.

I do not entirely understand the function of abhí in pāda a. It matches nearby III.48.4c … janúṣābhibhū́ya#, where abhí is part of gerund. It may also recall abhíbhūtim ugrám (I.118.9, IV.38.1, sim. VI.19.6), which in turn is a variant of abhibhūty-ójas- (cf. nearby III.48.4a, the vs. just cited for the gerund). In any case the abhí seems pretty functionless in this passage; my “over(whelmingly)” is an attempt to give it some function.
