Parjanya Although the Anukr. identifies the meter of vs. 2 as Pādanicṛṭ (7 7 / 7), it is clearly a Gāyatrī like the other two vss., with distraction of the gen. pl. ending -nãm at the end of pādas a, c.


## 02
This vs. consists only of a rel. cl; it could be attached either to vs. 1 or to vs. 3, both of which have pronouns in pādas adjacent to vs. 2 that could serve as referent (sá 1c, tásmai 3a). I prefer attaching it to vs. 3, since this configuration would fit the standard model of definitional relative clause / ritually based main clause.

On gárbham óṣadhīnām see VII.101.1c and comm. thereon.
