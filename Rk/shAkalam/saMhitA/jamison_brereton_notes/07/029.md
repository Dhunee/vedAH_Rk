## 01
Pāda d (dádo maghā́ni maghavann iyānáḥ) is almost a rewrite of V.28.5ab vocéma … maghávānam …, … rā́dhaso yád dádan naḥ, with iyānáḥ ‘being implored’ substituting for vocéma and rā́dhaḥ for maghā́ni.


## 02
The pāda-initial voc. bráhman shows the accent of the neut. bráhman- ‘formulation’, though it clearly belongs to the m. brahmán- ‘formulator’. The confusion is probably deliberate; the first word after the voc. phrase is bráhmakṛtim with the neut. 1st cmpd member, neut. pl. bráhmāṇi is found in pāda d, and note that the preceding hymn begins bráhmā (V.29.1a), with the neut. (see also V.29.2b).

Just as 1d is a variant of V.28.5ab, so also does 2b (arvācīnó háribhiḥ yāhi tū́yam) appear to play on V.28.1ab … úpa yāhi …, arvā́ñcas te hárayaḥ …, as well as echoing the immediately preceding vs. (29.1b ā́tu prá yāhi harivaḥ …) with háribhir yāhi tū́yam.

Ge takes tatane as a preterite (“… habe ich … gespannt”), but the fullgrade root syllable should signal a subjunctive, which also fits the context better (opt.

daśema [b], subj. śṛṇavaḥ [d]). In contrast Kü (210) considers the form a properly formed indicative and a relic, the regularly developed product of *ta-tn-̥ h2ai; although this could be possible, it seems unnecessary, given that the context favors a modal form.

Note that the hemistich finals dāśema (b) and hávemā́(d) rhyme, though they are morphologically entirelhy distinct.
