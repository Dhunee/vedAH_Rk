I take váriṣṭhā as a likely pun, not only ‘widest’ (hence a throat that can accommodate a lot of soma at one gulp), but also ‘best’; cf. disc. ad VI.37.4.

For prá √sthā with soma as expressed or implied obj., cf. I.15.9, VII.92.2, and, with prásthitam, II.36.4, 37.2.

I do not know the exact semantic nuance of sám √vṛt, but I think it must mean something more than Ge’s “mitkommen.” I take it here as purposive ‘turn oneself to’, with gavyúḥ expressing the purpose, but this may be pushing the idiom.

Note that the equational sentence ending d, yás te ánnam, does not show gender attraction between subj. and pred., as in later Vedic prose, although this phenomenon is found elsewhere in the RV. See, e.g., X.10.4, 11.8 and comm. thereon.
