Indra


## 01
Seems deliberately to echo the last vs. of the preceding hymn (I.4.10), with pāda b índram abhí prá gāyata “sing forth to Indra” matching I.4.10c tásmai índrāya gāyata “sing to him, to Indra” (the difference in case being governed by the presence of the preverb abhí in I.5.1). I.4.10 is then exactly repeated in I.5.4c. The sákhāyaḥ of I.5.1c also recalls I.4.10b sákhā — though the latter refers to Indra and the former to the priest-poets. But I.4.4c contains a pl. sákhibhyaḥ, which in our analysis has the same human referents as I.5.1, showing the reciprocal relation between men and gods that was one of the points of I.4.


## 02
purūtámam purūṇā́m is pleonastic, meaning literally “the first of many, of the many ones.”


## 03
My interpretation of these sentences as questions is not overtly marked in the text, but seems a reasonable use of the subjunctives.


## 05
The double dative sutapā̎vne … vītáye with yanti is more literally “… go to the soma-drinker [lit. ‘pressed (soma) drinker’] to pursue (him).”


## 10
A whiff of ring composition - 10c ī́śānaḥ ‘having control over’ echoes 2b ī́śānam, both modifying Indra. In 2b the god controls something undeniably positive, “choice things,” which he will presumably distribute to this favorites. In 10a he controls “the deadly weapon” that other mortals might wield against us. The identity of expression ties together the very different sentiments.
