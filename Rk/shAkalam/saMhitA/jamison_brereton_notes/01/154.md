Viṣṇu


## 01
The hymn begins with an almost exact echo of the famous opening pāda of the Indra hymn I.32 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam. In place of índrasya we have víṣṇoḥ and the missing syllable is made up by inserting the fairly functionless particle kam after nú.


## 02
The covert identification with Indra continues in pāda b, which is identical to X.180.2a, where Indra is the referent.


## 06
bhū́riśṛṅga- is tr. by all as ‘many-horned’, but this doesn’t make a lot of sense: each cow should have only two horns, unless Viṣṇu and Indra’s dwelling is a place of fantasy creatures. I have therefore rendered it ‘ample-horned’, meaning that the horns are quite sizeable. ‘Many-horned’ would be possible if the reference is to the whole herd of cattle: each cow has two horns, but the collectivity has many. I still prefer ‘ample’.
