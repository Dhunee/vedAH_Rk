Agni


## 01
On “the great goad” as the sun, see comm. ad VI.6.6.


## 02
This vs. is constructed in opposition to vs. 1. In vs. 1 the poet declares himself under the protection (śaraṇé) of Agni (gen.) as if under that of the sun (gen.); vs. 2 contains a number of genitives qualifying a negatively perceived person, who is therefore implicitly contrasted with the genitives of vs. 1. To support this balanced structure I supply “from the protection” (*śaraṇā́t) for the genitives to depend on (sim. WG) and a verb of motion with the preverb of separation ví that opens the verse (hence “(I go) away (from ...)”). There are, of course, other ways to supply the supporting structure.

aninásya ‘of the one lacking force’ in pāda a recalls iná inásya of I.149.1b.


## 03
As Ge (/WG) suggest, the exaggeratedly successful mortal in ab is probably meant to be the speaker himself. I have therefore supplied voce from 1a. The lack of a verb in our ab keeps the description from being typed as 3rd ps.; even the sá can have 1st ps. ref. (see Jamison “sa figé”).
