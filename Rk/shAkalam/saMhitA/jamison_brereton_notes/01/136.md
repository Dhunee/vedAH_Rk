Mitra and Varuṇa


## 02
In the publ. tr. I blindly followed Ge and Re in supplying jyótiṣe ‘light’ with uráve in a. Although this makes fine sense, neither scholar cites parallel passages. It is certainly true that jyótis- is qualified by urú- elsewhere (e.g., I.117.21, II.27.14, VI.3.1) and that jyótiṣmant- is found twice in the next vs. (I.136.3), but I think I would now be inclined to be more circumspect about what uráve refers to.


## 03
fg is somewhat hard to construe, in that there are three gods and two occurrences of yātayáj-janaḥ ‘setting the peoples in order’. Moreover, Varuṇa and Āryaman are directly adjacent to that epithet, but it is Mitra whose stable characteristic it is (cf., e.g., III.59.1 mitró jánān yātayati …). Mine is only one of the ways to handle the 3-into-2 problem.


## 04
The punctuation in the publ. tr. may not make it sufficiently clear that it is Soma “who gives shares in the drinking places.”


## 06
As noted in the publ. intro. there is abundant evidence of ring composition between this verse, the real final verse of the hymn, and vs. 1: 1a brhán námo ̥ / 6a námo ... brhaté ̥ ; 1bc mrḷ̥áyadbhyām / 6c sumr̥ḷīkā́ya; 1e úpastutā / 6d úpa stuhi. Cf.

also 2d dyukṣám / 6e dyukṣám, and 2c bhágasya / 6e bhágam.
