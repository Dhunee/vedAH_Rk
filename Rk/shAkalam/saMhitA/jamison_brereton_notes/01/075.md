Agni

## 01-02
Note the play between the two final words of these verses: āsáni / sānasí.

The two verses also contain four superlatives in -tama-, each to a stem ending in -as.

## 03-04
As noted in the publ. intro., only the first of the questions in vs. 3 is answered in vs. 4, though the latter appears to be structured as the replies.


## 05
The three pādas contain three 2nd sg. verb forms belonging to √yaj, two pres.

imperatives yájā (a, b) and a so-called “si-imperative” yákṣi (c). Though “siimperatives” do often function as imperatives, they are haplologized -s-aorist subjunctives by most accounts. I so tr. yákṣi here, since the poet could easily have repeated yájā in this context; it would have been metrically fine and in fact would have produced a more iambic pattern. It is accented because it follows an extrasentential voc. For another si-imperative that is better rendered as a subjunctive see ní … satsi in I.76.4 in the next hymn.


## 76-77
These two Triṣṭubh hymns are out of sequence, in that they both contain five verses. The preceding hymn I.75 in Gāyatrī also contains five verses, and among hymns of the same number of verses to the same divinity, those in the longer meter (in this case Triṣṭubh) should precede. Curiously, Old does not remark on this. The proper sequencing is restored with I.78, five verses in Gāyatrī.
