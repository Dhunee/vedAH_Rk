Ṛbhus


## 01
Calling the Ṛbhus “the godly breed” (devá- jánman-) is a bold way to begin this hymn precisely because they did not begin as gods but obtained immortality by their wondrous deeds — the deeds about to be recounted in the hymn.


## 02
Although vacoyújā is principally a dual acc., modifying the two fallow bays (hárī) as usual, it could also secondarily be taken as an instr. sg., modifying mánasā ‘with mind’. In any case, ‘speech’ and ‘mind’ are implicitly contrasted in this verse, and in addition mánasā contrasts with āsayā́‘by mouth’, referring to the means of creating.


## 03
Though Ge (/WG) takes sabardúgha- as the cow’s name, the word has a literal sense that works well in context.


## 05
A reference to the Third Pressing, with which the Ṛbhus are associated.
