Indra I.177.1, 3, 4: The appearance of two instances of the gerund yuktvā́and one of niṣádya may be a sign of the hymn’s lateness since the gerund is quite marginal in the RV.

The hemistich-internal enjambment in ab -- … vṛ́ṣā te, sutáḥ sómaḥ … -- is noteworthy, esp. because b is a repeated pāda (VII.24.2b), and in its other occurrence the pāda is syntactically self-contained. In fact, WG tr. the two pādas separately here, with vṛ́ṣā in pāda a referring to Indra and te a gen. with rátham: “Auf deinen stierhaften Streitwagen steige als Stierhafter.” This isn’t impossible, but the other interpr. (fld. by Ge and Re) seems more natural.


## 05
Ge takes vástoḥ as dependent on vidyā́ma (“Wir Lobsänger möchten … den neuen Tag erleben”), but vástoḥ is almost always a temporal marker elsewhere (e.g., in nearby I.179.1). I think rather that vidyā́ma simply anticipates the identical verb that opens the refrain pāda. For further disc., see comm. ad VI.24.9, whose pāda c is identical to our c (also X.89.17).
