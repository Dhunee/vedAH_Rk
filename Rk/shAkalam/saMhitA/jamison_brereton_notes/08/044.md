Agni

## 10-11
The contents of the imploring mentioned in 10c seems to be given in direct speech in 11.


## 11
With Ge I supply daha in b, with the preverb práti, since práti is not otherwise found with √pā, the verb of pāda a, but is common with √dah ‘burn’. Cf.

esp. I.12.15 práti ṣma ríṣataḥ daha. VII.15.13b is identical to our pāda, and the verb in pāda c of that vs. is daha, which governs the acc. in b.

As noted in the publ. intro., Agni is repeatedly referred to as both ‘inspired poet’ (vípra-) and ‘sage poet’ (kaví-) in this hymn, sometimes with the words in the same vs. (12, 21). Here -vépas-, belonging to the root of vípra-, √vip ‘tremble, become inspired’, co-occurs with kaví-, filling the contrastive vípra- role.


## 27
The root affiliation of iṣema is not entirely clear. Lub puts it with √iṣ ‘send’, but the case frame is wrong. But an affiliation with √iṣ ‘desire’ is even less likely. With Ge and Re I take it as meaning ‘hasten’ or the like and note the connection of the pāda, stómair iṣemāgnáye, with VIII.43.11c stómair vidhemāgnáye in the immediately preceding hymn, with iṣema a near-rhyme with vidhema in an otherwise identical pāda. Re suggests that the form and the syntactic construction have been borrowed from VIII.43.11, but doesn’t explain what verb we’re starting with (though I surmise ‘send’). So perhaps substituting for “we would send praises to Agni.”
