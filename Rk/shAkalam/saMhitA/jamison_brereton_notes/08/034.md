Indra On the formal structure that dominates this hymn see the intro. The hymn is awkward to translate and, I have to say, sometimes seems awkwardly composed.


## 01
I do not understand the accent on yayá in the refrain, but it may be implicitly contrastive with yāhi in a.


## 03
Note the syntactic disharmony between simile and frame, exploiting the variant valencies of the verb, with dhūnute an intrans.-reflexive in the frame (“felly shakes [itself]”) but transitive in the simile (“as a wolf shakes a lamb”). See Jamison 1982.


## 05
Since the referent of te is Indra, explicitly comparing him to a bull in the simile vṛ́ṣṇe ná seems odd, since he is ordinarily simply identified as such. Ge seems to think it’s a real bull, exhibiting thirst.


## 16
See the publ. intro. for the relation between the PN Vasurocis and the vocative addressed to Indra through the first fifteen verses, divāvaso.

An example of the rare 1st ps. dual construction “(I) and X” as subject of a 1st dual verb, with the “I” unexpressed: índraś ca dádvahe “(I) and Indra took …” For further discussion see VIII.62.11.


## 18
The apparent PN Pārāvata (‘who comes from afar’) apparently naming the patron makes sense as a speaking name in this hymn, which emphasizes the coming here of Indra from distant places and allows the identification of patron and Indra.

Note that the last word of the hymn is ā́, as it was the first (and it opens twelve of the hymn’s verses).
