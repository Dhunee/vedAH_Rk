Indra The meter of vss. 1-6 of this hymn is analyzed by Arnold (p. 248, E73) as consisting of 6 pādas: 12 12 / 8 8 8 8, and this arrangement of the stanzas is followed by HvN. Old disputes this, suggesting instead 12 8 4 / 8 12 4 8. (On the lack of accent on śatakrato, which he takes as a separable 4-syll. sequence, see his remarks on II.22.3.) Among other things, this division allows sám apsujít to be an independent sequence, as it is in its occurrences in Uṣṇih, VIII.13.2 and IX.106.3. On this expression see comm. ad VIII.13.2.

## 02-03
Somewhat unusual 2nd ps. reflexive using the standard 2nd ps. pronoun: 2a áva tvā́m “help yourself,” 3a ávasi … tvā́m. The accent on the verb in 3 is probably the textbook example of an implicitly contrastive accented verb, with predicates preceding and following.

This verse breaks out of the rigid structural mold of the first six verses, but note that it also echoes vs. 1: 1a avitā́si sunvatáḥ / 7a, c sunvatáḥ … āvitha.
