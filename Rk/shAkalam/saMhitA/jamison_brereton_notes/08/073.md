The curious phrase “honed with hope” is probably motivated in part by the phonological similarity in the Skt. āśásā# … aśāyata#. With Re (EVP XVI), I take aśāyata here to the root √śā ‘whet, sharpen’, not √(n)aś as with the other forms with the same apparent stem shape. See further ad VI.33.2.

Some of the interpretive questions in this vs. are 1) whether kím is a neut.

interrog. pronoun (as I take it) or a question particle (so Ge), and 2) what the referent of idám is. I supply ‘deed’, since that’s something regularly proclaimed. Ge and Re assume the referent is ávaḥ ‘Gnade’/‘faveur’ from the refrain. Since the refrain otherwise has no connection with the rest of the verse in this hymn, I think this solution is unlikely, but I hold no particular brief for my ‘deed’.
