All Gods For the rhetorical distance between vss. 1 and 2 see publ. intro.


## 01
The -ka- suffix on arbhaká- and kumāraká- mark these words as belonging to a lower register than normal Rigvedic discourse. See my 2009 “Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-ka-Suffix.”


## 02
As indicated in the publ. intro. I take the introductory íti here as a mark that the preceding vs. is the quoted praise referred to by iti stutā́so asathā “thus shall you be praised.” Re comments that this is a relatively rare passage with íti not close to direct speech. But my interpr. avoids that.

The 33, the (or a) canonical number of gods, were mentioned in a nearby hymn by the same poet, VIII.28.1.

Ge takes víśve vaiśvānarā́utá as “and all the Vaiśvānaras” (so also Klein, DGRV), but it is the gods who are vaiśvānará-, as Ge clearly states in his n. 4b.

(Interestingly, this is the only pl. form of this stem, which otherwise, save for one passage [IX.61.16, referring to light], is used only of Agni.) The terms that are being conjoined are ihá ‘here’ and ‘belonging to all men’, not gods and Vaiśvānaras; the point is that they are here and available to us because they belong to all of us. There is also complementary contrast between “all gods” and “(belonging) to all men,” and the víśve of the former phrase has been postponed so that it can adjoin the latter: devāsaḥ …, víśve vaiśvānarā́ḥ.
