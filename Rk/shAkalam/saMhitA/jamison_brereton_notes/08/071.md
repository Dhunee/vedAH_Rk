Agni


## 02
The 2nd hí pleonastically doubles the one in nahí.


## 05
I would delete “the” before “wisdom” in the publ. tr.

I consider gántā a possible, but not necessary ex. of a periphrastic future.


## 06
Supply ‘give’ from 3c rayím dehi viśvávāram, with the same obj. and an adj. echoed by puruvī́ram here.


## 12
I supply “we beseech” as the verb, from the twin pragātha vs. 13c īmahe, despite the interruption by a clause containing nom. agníḥ (13ab).

kṣaítrāya sā́dhase has to be interpr. in connection with the cmpd. kṣetrasā́dhas- (III.8.7, VIII.31.14). Ge’s interp. “zur Schlichtung (des Streites) um ein Feld” [for the settlement (of conflict) regarding a field] seems unnecessarily specific and contextually unsupported.
