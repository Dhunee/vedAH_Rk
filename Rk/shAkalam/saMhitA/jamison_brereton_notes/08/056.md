Old and Ge opt for the Kashmir Khila reading, nom. sg. pūtákratāyī, but it hardly makes sense that Dasyava Vṛka would be giving away his mother. It makes better sense to take the Saṃhitā reading pūtákratāyai (for *pūtákratāyyai), dat. (for gen.), “(the female one) of Pūtakratāyī,” namely her daughter and Dasyava Vṛka’s sister, who would be a more likely gift-in-marriage.

yūthyā̀m is probably a faulty reading. The Khila has yūthyàm, but Ge’s suggestion, yūthyā̀, seems plausible.

I suggest reading *bṛhát-sūro here, that is, a bahuvrīhi meaning ‘possessing a lofty sun’. The point is the usual one, that Agni is another form of the sun, and his flame as it rises is like the sun. The publ. tr. should have an asterisk before “having his own sun aloft.”
