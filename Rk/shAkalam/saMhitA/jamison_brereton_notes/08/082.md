The ca in b is baffling both as to position and function. Ge seems to take it as conjoining the imperatival clause in a with the present indicative clause in b (“Komm … und du wirst … gerufen…”); Klein (DGRV I.233) is disturbed by the “illocutionary difference” between the moods of the two clauses and suggests, “Perhaps the particle is merely a weak, untranslatable transitional element,” which, I’m afraid, is no help at all. Even if it is supposed to be conjoining the clauses, it is positioned wrong for this function.
