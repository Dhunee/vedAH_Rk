## 01
Ge and Old both suggest reading *yuktvā́for yuktā́, and Ge further suggests ráthe ná for ráthena. Although such emendations are legitimate in the poorly transmitted Vālakhilya, I see no reason to change the text if we can make it make sense as it stands.

## 02
Once again Old, Ge, and Re are in favor of various emendations (for which see the relevant discussions), but it is possible to make sense of the text, with the only alteration from assuming that dadṛśe stands for a dissimilated *dadṛśre.


## 03
I do not know who the bull (vṛṣabháḥ) is; Old suggests Indra, Ge Agni.
