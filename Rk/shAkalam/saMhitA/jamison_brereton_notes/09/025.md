hitáḥ here fairly clearly belongs to √hi ‘impel’, given the expressions of movement and goal in the rest of the vs. But the ambiguity between hitá- ‘impelled’ and ‘placed’ is common in this maṇḍala, as we’ve already seen (e.g., IX.1.2).

Both Ge and Re take dhármaṇā to be Soma’s: “nach deiner Bestimmung” and “selon (ta) nature” respectively. However, I take it to refer to the statute or ordinance of the ritual, in particular that which establishes Vāyu as the first recipient of the soma drink: dhármaṇā is used in this exact sense here as well as in IX.63.22 and I.134.5; see disc. ad the latter passage.

Soma is given Indra’s epithet vṛtrahán- as in vs. 6 of the preceding hymn (IX.24).

There is disagreement about what it means for Soma to “enter all forms” (víśvā rūpā́ṇy āviśán): Ge thinks that it refers to the various stages of soma preparation, while Re that it refers to the divine forms, that is the gods, whom Soma enters when he is drunk. I slightly favor Ge’s explanation, since Soma only reaches the gods in the last pāda.
