## 01
Pāda c, várdhanto asya vīryàm, is structured like 1c and 8c in the immediately preceding hymn, IX.7, though here asya must refer to Indra, not Soma.


## 02
As noted in the publ. intro., the gods Vāyu and the Aśvins, along with Indra, who was mentioned in the previous vs., are also the gods mentioned as the goal of the soma in IX.7.7.


## 04
Why do the thoughts number seven (saptá dhītáyaḥ)? Ge (n. 4ab) links them with the seven dhā́tars in nearby IX.10.3, while Re adds the seven dhā́man of IX.102.2. These suggestions are reasonably plausible, though they simply displace the numerical problem.

We should also note that the seven thoughts recur in the next hymn (IX.9.4), and another, unidentified, group of seven entities is found two vss. later (IX.9.6). IX.8-10 are attributed to the same poet, Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa (responsible indeed for IX.5-24), and he may simply have a penchant for the number seven; in our passage it would be a complement to the ten fingers (a number that of course makes sense). For saptá dhītáyaḥ and ten fingers in a hemistich almost identical to this one, see IX.15.8; for further occurrences of “seven inspired thoughts” see IX.62.17 and possibly IX.66.8.


## 07
The “comrade” (sákhi-) whom the soma is urged to enter is most likely Indra. The juxtaposition of the voc. índo with sákhāyam might be meant to evoke the phonological twin índram.
