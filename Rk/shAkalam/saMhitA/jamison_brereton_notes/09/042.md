## 01
Like the 1st vs. of the last hymn, also by Medhyātithi Kāṇva, this vs. is syntactically incomplete -- unless we want to take the pres. participles (janáyan a, b; vásānaḥ c) as predicated, which in this case I don’t. In this case, vs. 2 can easily pick up the participial vs. 1 and provide a predicate.


## 03
Acdg. to Kü (471), the medial part. of the pf. of √vṛdh is always presential, though both Ge and Re tr. as preterital. My “ever-increasing” makes it sound like an inten., but of course the heavy redupl. vā- simply belongs to the pf. of this root.

Note the v-alliteration in ab: vāvṛdhānā́ya tū́rvaye pávante vā́jasātaye.


## 04
The adj. pratná- ‘age-old’ is repeated here from 2a, linking the “age-old thought” (= hymn) with soma’s “age-old milk.” p-alliteration in ab: … pratnám ít páyaḥ pavítre pári …


## 05
Somewhat less insistent v-alliteration: víśvāni vā́ryā … devā́m̐ṛtāvṛ́dhaḥ.


## 06
This vs. contains almost the same elements as IX.41.4. Our desired rewards are gómat, vīrávat, áśvāvat, vā́javat, which match 41.4 except that híraṇyavat substitutes for vīrávat there. We also want bṛhatī́r íṣaḥ, like the mahī́m íṣam of 41.4. The soma is described as sutáḥ in both, though the vocatives are different: indo versus soma. But the big difference is that 41.4 has the preverb ā́with pavasva, which licenses the accusative complements, while our passage does not. We must simply supply it here, I’m afraid.
