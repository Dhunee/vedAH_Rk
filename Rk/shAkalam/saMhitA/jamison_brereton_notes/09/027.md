As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn, like the immediately preceding one, is unified by the simple device of a pronoun (here eṣá ‘this one’) repeated at the beginning of each vs. and rendered as such in English. Unlike the preceding hymn there is no switch of person at the end.


## 01
On the meaning of the root √tuś see comm. ad VIII.38.2.


## 03
The root-noun cmpd viśva-víd- is ambiguous, between ‘all-knowing’ and ‘allacquiring’ (see Scar 489). In this context, given svar-jít- ‘winning the sun’ (2b) and satrājít- ‘winning compeltely’ (4c), ‘acquiring all’ seems to work better; however, the very next hymn contains two instances of the same cmpd (IX.28.1, 5), where ‘knowing all’ is favored.


## 05
This vs. rather subtly contrasts the cosmic Soma, who is in heaven (ádhi dyávi)(ab), with the ritual substance in the filter (pavítre, c). See comm. ad IX.26.2, 3 in the preceding hymn.

On the formation and sense of hāsate see Narten (Sig.Aor. 285-86).


## 06
The last vs. of the hymn splits the locational difference found in vs. 5: Soma here flows in the midspace (antárikṣe), between the heavenly Soma and the soma on earth on the ritual ground.
