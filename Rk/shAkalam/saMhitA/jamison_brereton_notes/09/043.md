The phonological near-identity of instr. pl. góbhiḥ and gīrbhíḥ allows them to be conceptually assimilated to each other, and note that vāsáya- ‘clothe’ is frequently also used with góbhiḥ: e.g., IX.8.5 sáṃ góbhir vāsayāmasi (also IX.2.4, 14.3, 66.13).


## 02

## 03

## 04
On vidā́versus vidā́(ḥ), see comm. ad IX.19.6.
