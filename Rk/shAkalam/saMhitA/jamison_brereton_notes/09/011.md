## 01
asmai is only the second word in the hymn and is unaccented; therefore it should technically refer to something already mentioned in the discourse. But since soma is the topic of all discourse in this ritual context, no prior verbal mention is necessary. Sim.

IX.70.1; see also asya in IX.29.1a, IX.30.1a.


## 02
Pāda c consists entirely of a rudimentary etymological figure, deváṃ devā́ya devayú. The acc. devám is of course Soma as god, coreferential with páyaḥ ‘milk’, a metaphor for soma the substance, in pāda a; the dative devā́ya is Indra. I take devayú as an adverb; so also Re. It is also possible (see, e.g., Re’s n.) to take it as a neut. modifying páyaḥ, as Gr does -- and, it seems, Ge. In that case, devám would need to be a neut. adj.

‘divine’ (Ge’s “die göttliche”), but the number of clearly adjectival uses of devá- is very low. See, however, IX.13.5 and VII.21.1.


## 04
DAT gāthám arcata can be seen as a paraphrase of úpa DAT gāyatā in 1a, with etymological matching.

The epithet divispṛ́ś- ‘touching heaven’ is almost the only departure in this hymn from the tight, earthbound focus on the ritual.


## 06
Pāda c índum índre paraphrases deváṃ devā́ya in 2c, though with a loc., not dat. 
## 07
Pāda b is almost identical with 3a.


## 09
The índo- índra- figure appears yet again, in different cases (voc., instr.).
