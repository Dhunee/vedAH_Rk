Like the horns (of a butting animal), come in front toward us, darting  like hooves endowed with staying power.
Like cakravāka-geese (reuniting) at every dawn, o you ruddy ones,
journey this way like chariot-drivers, o able ones. 4. Like boats, take us across—like yokes, like wheel naves, like a wheel’s  cross-pieces, like its outer-pieces, (take) us (across).
Allowing no injury to our bodies like dogs, like amulets [?] protect us  from collapse.
