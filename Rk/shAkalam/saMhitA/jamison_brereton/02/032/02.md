Let secret swindles not deceive us on the day of Ä€yu [=offering day?]. Do  not make us subject to these misfortunes.
Do not keep us far away from your companionship. Know this
(speech?) of ours. With a mind seeking favor we beseech you for this. 3. With a mind without anger bring here your attentive hearing, a swelling  cow who gives milk, inexhaustible.
With steps [/(verses measured) in feet] and with speech I impel you, the  swift prize-winner, through all the days, o much invoked one.
