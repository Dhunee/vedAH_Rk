Adhvaryus! Who struck, like a tree with a spear, Vr̥tra, who had enclosed  the waters,
to him bring this (soma) since he desires it. This Indra deserves to drink it. 3. Adhvaryus! Who struck Dr̥bhīka and who drove up the cattle—for he  had opened the cave—
to him (bring) this (soma), (rushing swiftly) like the wind within the  midspace. Cover Indra with the soma juices, as a fast horse (is
covered) with blankets (after a race).
