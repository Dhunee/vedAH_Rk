And these two well-portioned goddesses of opposite appearance, Dawn  and Night, also speeders of moving creatures, (will speed the chariot), when, (o Heaven and) Earth, I will praise you two with a newer speech,  I possessing triple vigor to strew vigor as the underlayer for the still (world). 6. And we want a laud for you like that of the fire-priests. Ahi Budhnya,  Aja Ekapad, and
Trita, the Master of the RÌ¥bhus, and Savitar take delight, also the Child of the  Waters who impels the swift (horses), through (our) thought and labor.
