For you two rip away the resolve (of him) whom you combat, but you  are stimulators of (even) a feeble man who performs sacrifice.
You, Indra and Soma—help us. In this fearful place create wide space. 7. It will not tire nor weary me, and there will be no flagging. We will not  say, “Don’t press soma (for him [=Indra],)”
(Indra,) who will grant to me, who will give, who will be attentive, who  will approach me with cows, as I press it.
