We inspired poets have abided by you, Indra. Serving according to the  truth, we would gain insight.
Seeking your help, we would create for ourselves a proclamation of your  praise. On this very day, we would be those to be given wealth by you. 13. Indra, might we be those of yours who are accompanied by your help,  since, seeking your help, we make your nourishment strong.
Grant us the most explosive wealth in which we will delight, o god— that consisting of heroic men. 14. Grant us peaceful dwelling. Grant us alliance. Grant us a Marutian  warrior band, o Indra.
And they who jointly are finding exhilaration—(those) Winds drink the  first offering.
