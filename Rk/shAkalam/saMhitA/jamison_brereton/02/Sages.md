The eponymous poet of Maṇḍala II, the first of the Family Books, is Gr̥tsamada,  who was the son of Śunahotra Āṅgirasa and the adopted son of Śunaka Bhārgava  according to Sāyaṇa and the Anukramaṇī. The hymns refer to the people of the poet  as Gr̥tsamadas four times, but also as Śunahotras three times. Of the forty-three  hymns in this maṇḍala, the Anukramaṇī ascribes all but seven to Gr̥tsamada himself. It attributes II.4–7 to Somāhuti Bhārgava, who would have thus belonged  to the lineage of Gr̥tsamada’s father by adoption, and II.27–29 either to Kūrma  Gārtsamada or to Gr̥tsamada. One of the characteristic features of the hymns of  this maṇḍala is that twenty-one of its hymns, almost half, end with the signature  refrain of the Gr̥tsamadas, “May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.”
