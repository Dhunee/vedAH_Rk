We call upon you, the troop-lord of troops, the most famous poet  of poets,
the preeminent king of sacred formulations, o lord of the sacred
formulation. Hearing us, sit down upon your seat together with your help. 2. Even the prescient gods attained their sacrificial portion from you, lordly  BrÌ¥haspati.
As the great sun is (the begetter) of ruddy dawn through its light, you are  the very begetter of all formulations.
