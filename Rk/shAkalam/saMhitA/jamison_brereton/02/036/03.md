As if to home, come to us here, all you of easy call; then sit on the ritual  grass and take pleasure.
Then, o Tvaṣṭar, become exhilarated on the stalk, having delighted in the  call, flocking with the divine ones, (namely) the Wives (of the Gods). 4. Convey the gods hither, you inspired poet, and perform sacrifice.  Willingly, o Hotar, sit down in your three wombs.
Receive the somian honey that has been set forth. Drink from the
Agnīdh’s cup. Reach satiety from your portion. [=Agni]
