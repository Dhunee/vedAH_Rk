Far-going and fore-going is the first (gift) of him who gives  abundantly. The things easily found by Br̥haspati are to be realized. These are the things won by the intent seer, the prize-winner, through  whom both races [=gods and humans], their clans, find satisfaction. 11. Far-going everywhere within the lower settlement [=among humans],  you, who are great and joy-bringing, increase in power—
the god spreads out widely before the gods; the lord of the sacred  formulation encompasses all those things. 12. All that is real belongs just to you two, o generous ones. Even the waters  do not confound your commandment.
O Indra, o lord of the sacred formulation, do you two come here to our  offering, like two prize-winning yokemates to their food.
