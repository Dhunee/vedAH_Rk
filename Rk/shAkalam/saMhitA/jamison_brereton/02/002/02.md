Toward you have the nights and the dawns bellowed, o Agni, like  milk-cows in good pastures to their calf.
As the spoked wheel of heaven [=sun] (does) through the human (life-) spans, through the successive nights you shine, o you of many favors. 3. Him of wondrous power have the gods fitted down at the base of the airy  realm [=on earth], as their spoked wheel of heaven and earth—
Agni with his flaming flame—like a chariot worthy to be acquired, to be  proclaimed like an envoy (installed) among the settled peoples.404 II.2
