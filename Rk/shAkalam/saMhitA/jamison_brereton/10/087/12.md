O Agni, in the hoarse-voiced (singer) fix that eye with which you see the  hoof-breaking sorcerer.
Like an Atharvan fire-priest, with your divine light burn down the  unobservant (sorcerer) who injures the true. 13. What today two opponents will utter as curses (at each another), o Agni,  what harshness of speech those with hoarse voices will give birth to,
what missile is born from the mindâ€™s fury, with that pierce the sorcerers  in the heart.
