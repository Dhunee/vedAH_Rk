With your sharp eye, Agni, guard the sacrifice. Lead it forth to the east  for the good (gods), o forethoughtful one.
Let the sorcerers not deceive you, ever blazing against the demonic  powers with your murderous intent, o you with your eye on men. 10. With your eye on men, look all over for the demonic among the clans.  Shatter his three points.
Agni, with your blaze cleave his ribs, and hew the root of the sorcerer  into three parts.
