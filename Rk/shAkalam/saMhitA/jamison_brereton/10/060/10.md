I brought the mind of Subandhu here from Yama Vaivasvata,
for living, not for death, but for invulnerability. 11. Downward does the wind blow; downward the sun gives heat.
The cow gives milk that goes downward; downward let your malady go. 12. Here is my hand that brings good fortune; here is my (other hand)  bringing better fortune.
Here is my all-healing one; here the one of propitious touch.
The next twenty-four hymns, X.61–84, are paired hymns, generally attributed to the  same poet and showing signs of internal connection.
The first pair (61–62) are the Nābhānediṣṭha hymns to the All Gods, the first  devilishly complex, the second far less so.
