And even now Dawn, rich in cattle, rich in glory, accompanied by the  Sun, has dawned for Manu,
when they [=priests] beget Agni as Hotar for the ritual distribution—him  being eager for it and following the will of those who are (also) eager. 4. And this drop here [=Soma], widespread and widely visible, has the bird,  the falcon that was sent (for it), brought here to the rite,
when the Ārya clans choose wondrous Agni as their Hotar. And so was  his insight born.
