When what was to be done was at its middle, at the encounter when the  father was making love to the young girl—
as they were going apart, the two left behind a little semen sprinkled  down on the back and in the womb of the well-performed (sacrifice). 7. When the father “sprang on” his own daughter, he, uniting (with her),  poured down his semen upon the earth.
The gods, very concerned, begat the sacred formulation, and they  fashioned out (of it?) the Lord of the Dwelling Place, protector of  commandments.
