Over and over, o Agni, you bull, you wrest together all things from the  stranger.
You are kindled in the footprint of refreshment. Bring goods here to us. 2. Come together, speak together; together let your thoughts agree,
just as the gods of long ago, coming to an agreement together, reverently  approach their sacrificial portion.
