You two gave to Pedu a white horse, a prizewinner with nine and ninety  prizes, o Aśvins,
(a horse) to be celebrated, one setting its comrades to running, to be
invoked by men like good fortune, and the embodiment of joy. 11. O you two kings and Aditi—not from anywhere does distress or  difficulty or fear reach him
for whom you arrange that his chariot, along with his wife, will be in  front, o Aśvins good to invoke, you who follow the course of the
Rudras [=Maruts].
