Indra by his greatness confounded the commandments of the great  Flood [=Vala], while being hymned by the Aṅgirases.
He rooted the dusky realms, though they are many—he who buttressed  their buttress by means of (their [=Aṅgirases’] poetic?) realization. 5. Indra is the counterpart of heaven and of earth. He knows all the  pressings; he smites Śuṣṇa.
With the sun he stretched through heaven, though it is great. He also  propped it up with a prop, (himself) a better prop (than the prop). 6. Because with your mace as Vr̥tra-smiter you laid Vr̥tra low, (laid low)  the wiles of the godless one swollen with strength,
you then, bold one, boldly hewed him apart, and so you became  arm-strong, bounteous one.
