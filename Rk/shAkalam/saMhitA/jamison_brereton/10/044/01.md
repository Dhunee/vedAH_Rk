Let Indra, our own lord, drive here for exhilarationâ€”he who, forceful,  thrusting according to his own principle,
is projecting his vigor over all powers with his boundless, great
bullishness. 2. Your chariot provides a good standing place and your fallow bays are  easy to control. Your mace is attached to your fist, o lord of men.
Along a good path, o king, drive swiftly in this direction. We will
strengthen your bullish powers when you have drunk.
