We have made all these soma-pressings powerful, to draw (you) here— which you have (now) taken into your own self, o son of strength.
To your liking and for your support, are, in succession, the cup, the
sacrifice, the mantra, and the upraised sacred formulation and speech. 7. Those who craft sacred formulations for you when the soma is pressed,  for you to give of goods and of good, o inspired one,
through the thought of your favor they will go forward along the path,  at your exhilaration on the pressed soma-stalk.
The next three hymns (X.51–53), attributed to Agni Saucīka, treat the well-known  story of the flight and disappearance of Agni, who wished to avoid the ritual role  of conveying the oblations and the fate of his brothers. The gods find him hidden in  the waters and entice him back by promising him a share in the sacrifice.
