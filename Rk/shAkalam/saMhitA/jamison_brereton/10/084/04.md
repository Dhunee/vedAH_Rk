You alone are reverently invoked by many, Battle Fury. Hone every clan  for battle.
O one of unbroken brilliance, with you as yokemate we raise our
heavenly cry for victory. 5. Creating victory like Indra, without talking us down, Battle Fury,  become our overlord here.
We hymn your dear name, victorious one. We know the wellspring
whence you came to be ready to hand.
