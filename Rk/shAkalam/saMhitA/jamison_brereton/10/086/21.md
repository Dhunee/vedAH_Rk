[Indrāṇī:] “Come here again, Vr̥ṣākapi. We two will arrange easy  passages (for you),
who, as sleep-destroyer [/-attainer], go home again (to death) along  the path.”
– Above all Indra! 22. When, o Vr̥ṣākapi, o Indra, you (all) went upward toward home, where was this beast of many misdeeds, to whom did the effacer of
men go?
– Above all Indra!
