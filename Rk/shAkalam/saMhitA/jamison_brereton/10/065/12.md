You rescue Bhujyu from difficult straits, o Aśvins. You gave life to  Śyāva, the son of Vadhrimatī.
You carried Kamadyū to Vimada. You let loose Viṣṇāpū for Viśvaka. 13. The daughter of Pavīru, Thunder, and Aja Ekapad, the supporter of  heaven, the river, and the waters of the sea—
all the gods will hear my words: (they and also) Sarasvatī, along with  insights [/Dhī] and with plenty [/Puraṃdhī].
