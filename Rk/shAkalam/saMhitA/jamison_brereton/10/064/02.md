Our intentions are intent (on them), the insights in our hearts. Our  trackers follow their track and fly to (all) directions.
No dispenser of mercy other than them is found. My desires have
fastened upon the gods. 3. (Shall it be) Narāśaṃsa, Pūṣan, Agohya (the Unconcealable), or Agni  kindled by the gods that I address with a hymn,
or the Sun and Moon, (the new and) bright [=full] Moon, Yama in
heaven, Trita, Wind, Dawn, Night, the Aśvins?
