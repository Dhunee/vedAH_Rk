Because, o discerning ones, Aditi, the mother of you two is, like Heaven  and Earth, (occupied) in purifying with her milk—
(all of you,) allot things dear (to us); wash (us) with the rays of the sun. 7. Because you two who rule over property have taken your seats, he [=the  priest?] has mounted, like a chariot, the one [=sacrificial fire] sitting at  the chariot-pole (of the sacrifice), sitting on the wood.

narrow straits.
