Make slack the taut (bow) of the evilly angry mortal.
Set him beneath our feet—whoever will set his sights on us.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 3. Shake down these lofty all-glittering refreshments, you foe-smiter,
through your abilities, able Indra, along with all your forms of help.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 4. Since you shake down all these, o Indra of a hundred resolves,
like wealth for the presser, together with thousandfold forms of help,
the goddess Begetter begot (you), the auspicious Begetter begot (you). 5. Like beads of sweat let the missiles fly down, scattered all around
like blades of dūrvā grass. Let malevolence go away from us.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 6. Because you carry your ability like a long crook, you rich in counsel, you will hold (it) as a goat (does) a branch with its forefoot,
bounteous one.
– The goddess Begetter begat (you), the auspicious Begetter begat (you). 7. O gods, never do we confound, never do we efface (them):
we practice obedience to your solemn utterances.
We grab onto (you) here by the sides, by the shoulders.
