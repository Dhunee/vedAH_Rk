I was like a father to the Vetasus for them to prevail; I made Tugra and  Smadibha subject to Kutsa.
I came to be under the direction of the sacrificer: when I brought myself  to the fore for Tuji, his dear things were not to be assailed. 5. I made Mr̥gaya subject to Śrutarvan, when he yielded to me when the  ritual patterns were in due order.
I made the vassal submissive for Āyu, and I made Paḍgr̥bhi subject
to Savya.
