Let Indra with the Vasus protect our livelihood on every side. Let Aditi  with the Ādityas extend shelter to us.
The god Rudra with the Rudras shall be merciful to us. Let Tvaṣṭar with  the Wives (of the Gods) enliven us for good faring. 4. Aditi, Heaven and Earth, great truth, Indra and Viṣṇu, the Maruts, and  the lofty Sun—
we call upon the gods for help—the Ādityas, Vasus, Rudras, and
well-skilled Savitar.
