Now (I shall proclaim) the greatness of Wind and of his
chariot: shattering as he goes; thundering is his sound.
Touching heaven as he drives, turning things red, and tossing up dust  from the earth as he goes. 2. The dispersed eddies of the Wind press forward together following (him).  They go to him, like girls to a festive gathering.
Yoked together with them on the same chariot, the god speeds on as  king of this whole world.
