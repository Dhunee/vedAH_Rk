Approximately half the maṇḍala is organized into collections generally attributed to individual poets. The first few of these collections are comparable in number of hymns to those in I, but starting with X.61 the hymns are arranged first in  pairs (61–84) and then, beginning with X.85, as individual hymns.

This maṇḍala contains too many striking hymns, famous or unsung, to list here.  The reader is referred to the introductions to the individual collections and hymns.

The first nine hymns of Maṇḍala X are assigned to two different poets: Trita Āptya  1–7 and Triśiras Tvāṣṭra (“Three-Headed Son of Tvaṣṭar”) 8–9. Both of these are  mythological figures, who appear as opponents in the same myth, which is narrated  briefly at the end of X.8. Although the poets’ names were generated from the mythological material and therefore do not reflect “real” poets, it is clear from their narrative connection that the hymns belong together (Oldenberg 1888: 232–35). All of the Trita Āptya hymns (1–7) and the first two-thirds of X.8 are dedicated  to Agni. The last three verses of X.8 (7–9), where the myth of the confrontation of  Trita Āptya and his three-headed opponent is narrated, is assigned to Indra by the  Anukramaṇī. The final hymn (X.9) is to the Waters.
