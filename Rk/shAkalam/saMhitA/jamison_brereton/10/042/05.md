Whoever, providing a pleasing offering, presses for him sharp soma  drops, ample like streaming wealth (on the hoof),
for him (Indra) makes a team of his rivals, easily spurred, easily goaded,  in the early morning of the day. He smashes the obstacle [/Vr̥tra]. 6. Indra, upon whom we have set our laud, the bounteous one who has  fixed his desire upon us—
let his rival, though he is far away, take fright, and let the peoples’  brilliant things bow down to him.
