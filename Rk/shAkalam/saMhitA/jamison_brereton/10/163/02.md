From your neck(bones?), the (bones of the?) nape of your neck, your  vertebrae, your backbone,
I tear the disease of the torso out of you—from your shoulders, from  your arms. 3. From your entrails, your guts, your rectum, your heart,
I tear out the disease—from your kidneys, your liver, your intestines.
