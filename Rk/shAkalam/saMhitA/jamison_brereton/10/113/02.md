Viṣṇu with his strength (assisted) his [=Indra’s] greatness, having run to  the plant [=soma]. It teems with honey.
Upon smiting Vr̥tra with the gods [=Maruts] as fellow travelers,
bounteous Indra became worthy to be chosen. 3. When, bearing weapons, you stood with Vr̥tra the serpent, for battle, to  acquire a laud,
all the Maruts together in person there increased your greatness and  Indrian power, strong one.
