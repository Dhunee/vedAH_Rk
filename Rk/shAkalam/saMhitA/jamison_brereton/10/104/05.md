Through your guidance—you of good praise, of good favor, and of  much radiance, o master of the fallow bays—the peoples,
your praisers, are acquiring your most bounteous help to bring them  across—and through your liberal gifts, Indra. 6. O you of the fallow bays, drive near to our sacred formulations with  your pair of fallow bays to drink of the pressed soma.
Indra, the sacrifice has reached you, patiently waiting. You are the
pious sign of the rite.
