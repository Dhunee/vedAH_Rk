“How many fires are there and how many suns? How many dawns, and  how many waters?
O forefathers, I am not saying something two-faced to you: o poets,  I am asking you in order to know.” 19. For as long as the fine-feathered (mares [=flames?]) clothe themselves as  if in the face of Dawn, o Mātariśvan,
for that long the Brahmin establishes (the fire), approaching the
sacrifice and taking his seat near to the Hotar.
