As you, the immortal, circle the seven domains, as you do pious work for  the pious, be generous to the one who performs (rituals) well
with wealth rich in heroes ready to hand, o Agni. Whoever has reached  toward you with a kindling stick, take pleasure in him. 4. The beacon of the sacrifice, the foremost one set in front do the seven  (priests) offering oblations reverently invoke as prizewinnerâ€”
Agni who hears them, the bull with ghee on his back, the god who gives  to the giver an abundance of heroes.
