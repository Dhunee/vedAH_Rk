Mount your lifetime, choosing old age, taking your place each following  the last, as many as you are.
Here will Tvaṣṭar, affording good birth, in concert (with the Wives of the  Gods), make a long lifetime for you to live. 7. These women here, non-widows with good husbands—let them, with  fresh butter as ointment, approach together.
Without tears, without afflictions, well-jeweled, let the wives first mount  the womb.
