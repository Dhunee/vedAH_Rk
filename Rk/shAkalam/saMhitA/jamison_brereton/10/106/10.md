Like āraṅgara you produce (the milk) in the cow whose opening is  below, as bees produce honey,
like plowmen sweating out their sweat. Like earth, (a cow) that feeds on  good pasture, you are accompanied by nourishment. 11. Might we bring our praise song to fulfillment and might we win the  prize of victory. Sharing the same chariot, drive here—you two—
right up to our mantra
and to the cooked honey within the cows, as if to glory. Bhūtāṃśa has  fulfilled the desire of the Aśvins.
