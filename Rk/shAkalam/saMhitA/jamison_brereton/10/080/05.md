It’s Agni whom seers vie in calling upon with their recitations; Agni (do)  men when hard-pressed on an expedition;
Agni (do) birds flying in the midspace. Agni encircles thousands of cows. 6. It’s Agni whom the clans stemming from Manu invoke; Agni (do) those  born variously from Manu and from Nahus.
Agni (has found) the Gandharvan path of truth; Agni’s pasture-land is  set down in ghee.
