(Be there) for us, Indra, o champion, with champions, and (let us be)  aided by you, by your power.
In many places offerings bellow to you in competition like battle cries. 10. You incited these excellent men at the obstacle-smiting for the
Karpan [?], you mace-wielding champion,
when (you found?) him [=Śuṣṇa] in hiding—the sage poets (being
there), (profiting from) *the strength of your lordly power, *like
the clans. 11. Right away these things (became) yours, Indra, on gaining control over  (his) property for giving, you mace-wielding champion,
when with your fellow travelers you humbled everything born of Śuṣṇa. 12. Let your good superior powers not go nowhere for us, champion Indra. May each one of us be in the favor of these (powers) of yours,
mace-wielder.
