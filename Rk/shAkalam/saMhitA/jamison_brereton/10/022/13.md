For us let these (gifts?) of yours (become) real. They bring no injury— your caresses,
whose benefits, like those of milk-cows, we would know, mace-wielder. 14. While, handless and footless, the earth grew strong through the powers  of her wise ways,
you, circling him with respectful circumambulation [=as if for the
animal sacrifice], jabbed down Śuṣṇa for the whole of life.
