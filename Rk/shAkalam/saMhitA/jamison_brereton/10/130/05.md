The virāj meter is the full glory of Mitra and Varuṇa, and the triṣṭubh  meter is here Indra’s portion of the (sacrificial) day.
The jagatī meter entered the All Gods. According to this did the seers,  the sons of Manu, arrange (the ritual). 6. The seers, the sons of Manu, our fathers, arranged (the ritual) according  to this, when the sacrifice was born in ancient times.
Seeing with my mind as my eye, I think of the ancient ones who offered  this sacrifice.
