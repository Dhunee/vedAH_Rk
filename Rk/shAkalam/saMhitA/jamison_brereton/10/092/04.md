For heaven, the broad expanse, is the trajectory of truth. (There there is)  Reverence and great Devotion, the very admirable.
(There) Indra, Mitra, Varuṇa perceive with like mind, and Bhaga and  Savitar—(all) possessing refined skill. 5. The rivers go forth with the journeying Rudra; across great Devotion  they have run—
those with which the earth-circling one [=Parjanya?], going around
the broad expanse, constantly rumbling in his belly, besprinkles
everything.
