At the seat of Vivasvant [=ritual ground] the bard will speak forth your  highest greatness, o waters,
for forth they strode in three stages, seven each time; forth (strode)
Sindhu with her strength, beyond that of the (other) flowing (waters). 2. Varuá¹‡a dug out the paths for you to travel, when, o Sindhu, you ran to  the prizes.
You travel on a slope along the back of the earth, when you direct the  front rank of these moving (beings).
