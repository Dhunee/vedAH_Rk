When you drove, you two lords of beauty, to Sūryā to woo her, where was your single wheel; where did you stand for the pointing out? 16. Your two wheels, o Sūryā—the brahmins know (them) according to  their season.
But the one wheel that is hidden—that just the experts know. 17. To Sūryā, to the gods, to Mitra and Varuṇa—
those who are forethoughtful of creation—to them I have made this  obeisance here.
