Stay just here, (you two); don’t go apart. Attain your entire lifespan, playing with your sons and grandsons, rejoicing in your own house. 43. Let Prajāpati generate progeny for us. Let Aryaman anoint (you?) till  old age.
Without ill-omen enter the world of your husband. Be weal for our
two-footed, weal for our four-footed.
