A man thinks he has drunk the soma when they crush the plant. But the Soma that the formulators knowâ€”no one at all consumes that. 4. Protected by those whose regulation is sheltering, guarded by those  belonging to heights, o Soma,
you just stay listening to the pressing stones. No earth-dweller
consumes you.
