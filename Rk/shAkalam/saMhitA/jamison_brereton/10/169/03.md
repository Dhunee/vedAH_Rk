Who raised their own body up among the gods (as oblation), of whom  Soma knows all the colors,
swelling with milk, rich in offspring, grant them to us in our stable, Indra. 4. Prajāpati, having given them to me, in concord with all the gods and the  forefathers,
has sent them here, being well-disposed, to our stable. Might we reside  together with their offspring.
