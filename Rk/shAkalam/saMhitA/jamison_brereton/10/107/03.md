The priestly gift is the divine bestowal, a sacrificial offering to the gods; it  is not for the stingy, for they do not bestow.
But many men who present priestly gifts bestow through fear of disgrace. 4. Those with manly sight see (it as) the wind with its hundred streams (of  rain), (as) the chant that finds the sun; they see (it as) the oblation.
Those who bestow and present at the (sacrificial) assembly, they milk the  priestly gift with its seven mothers.
