Always may we—of good mind, of good eye, rich in offspring, without  disease, without blame—
living a long time look upon you rising every day, o Sun who have
Mitra’s might. 8. Upon you, o wide-gazing one, bringing great light, luminous, a joy to  every eye,
mounting from the surface of lofty (heaven)—may we, living, look
upon (you), o Sun.
