What are your highest domains, what your lowest, and these that are  your midmost, Viśvakarman—
do your best for them for the sake of your companions at the oblation,  o you of independent will. Increasing your own person, by yourself
sacrifice for yourself. 6. O Viśvakarman, since you are increased through the oblation, by  yourself win earth and heaven by sacrifice.
Let the other peoples all around be left in confusion; for us here let there  be a generous patron!
