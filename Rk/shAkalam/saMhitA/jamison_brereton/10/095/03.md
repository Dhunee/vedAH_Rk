[Purūravas:] “...as an arrow from the quiver of beauty, a shot winning  cows, as a charge winning hundreds.
Under the will of no man, she will keep flashing forth like (lightning);  like a lamb its bleating, so are her tumultuous (tempests) displayed.” 4. [Purūravas:] “She was (always) imparting energy, a good thing, to her  father-in-law—every dawn, whenever he wants it, from the house
opposite.
She attained a home in which she took pleasure; day and night she was  pierced by my rod.”
