[Urvaśī:] “O Purūravas, don’t die. Don’t fly away. Don’t let the unkindly  wolves eat you.
There exist no partnerships with women: they have hyenas’ hearts.” 16. [Urvaśī:] “When in different form I roamed among mortals and spent  the nights (with you?) for four autumns,
once a day I ate a drop of ghee. Just from that I continue to be sated now.” 17. [Purūravas:] “She who fills the midspace, who is the measurer of the  dusky realm, Urvaśī—I, the best (of men?), seek to bring her under  my sway.
Since the granting of a good deed will stand you in good stead, turn  back: my heart is scorched.”
