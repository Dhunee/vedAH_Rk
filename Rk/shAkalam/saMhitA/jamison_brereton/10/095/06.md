[Purūravas:] “The beautifully glowing rank (of Apsarases), friends in good  favor, interlaced like a pond’s-eye [=lotus], (always) on the move—
these flowed like reddish salves; like milk-cows they bellowed for beauty.” 7. [Urvaśī:] “When this one [=the son of Purūravas and Urvaśī] was being  born, the women were in attendance, and the rivers, gurgling to
themselves, strengthened him,
(just) as for great battle, for the smiting of Dasyus, the gods made you  strong, Purūravas.”
