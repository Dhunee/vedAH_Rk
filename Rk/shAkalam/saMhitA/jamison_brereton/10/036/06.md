O Aśvins, make our sacrifice heaven-touching and of lively ceremony, to  seek favor—
a sacrifice with its reins pointed eastward, bepoured with ghee. – This  help of the gods we choose today. 7. I invoke the Marutian flock, (which is) good to invoke, (which is) pure,  high, luck itself—for comradeship.
Might we acquire the thriving of wealth in order to receive good
fame. – This help of the gods we choose today.
