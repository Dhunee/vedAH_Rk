O Indra, stand fast, bounteous one. A thing like you is to be enjoyed.  Praised as the soma-drinker, be here for our strengthening.
Let Savitar, along with the gods, further our (speech, so it is) heard. – We  choose wholeness and innocence. 2. Bring forward for the taking a portion at the proper time, for Vāyu who  drinks the pure soma, roaring in his quest,
who has attained the drinking of the gleaming milk. – We choose
wholeness and innocence.
