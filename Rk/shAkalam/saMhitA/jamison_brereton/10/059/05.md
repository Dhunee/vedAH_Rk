You leader to (the other) life, keep our mind firm in us. Lengthen our  lifetime, for living.
Find pleasure in our seeing the sun; strengthen your own body with ghee. 6. You leader to the (other) life, again put sight in us, again breath in us  here, for our use.
For a long time may we look upon the sun as it rises. O Concord, be  gracious to us with well-being.
