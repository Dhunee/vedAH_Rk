Those of evil ways who transgress against Mitra [/an alliance] and  against Aryaman, against agreements and against Varuṇa—
grind your bulging bullish ruddy weapon of death down on those
without alliance (to us), o bullish Indra. 10. Indra is master of heaven and Indra of earth, Indra of the waters and  Indra of the mountains,
Indra of the strong and Indra of the wise; Indra is to be called upon in  peace and Indra in war.
