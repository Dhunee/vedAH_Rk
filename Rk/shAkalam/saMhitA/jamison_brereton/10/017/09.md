Sarasvatī, whom the forefathers invoke, as they arrive at the sacrifice in  the south—
provide here a portion of refreshment worth thousands and thriving of  wealth among the sacrificers. 10. Let the waters, the mothers cleanse us; let them, ghee-pure, purify us  with their ghee,
for the goddesses carry forth every defilement. I rise up from them
gleaming, purified.
