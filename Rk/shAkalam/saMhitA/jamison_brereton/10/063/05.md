The very strong sovereign kings who have come to the sacrifice, who,  undeviating, have established their own dwelling in heaven—
seek to entice them here with reverence, with well-turned (hymns)—the  great Ādityas and Aditi—for well-being. 6. Who brings to success for you the praise that you will enjoy, all you  gods of Manu, however many you are?
Who will properly prepare for you, powerfully born ones, the ceremony  that will carry us across difficult straits—for well-being?
