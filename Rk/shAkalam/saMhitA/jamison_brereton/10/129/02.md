Death did not exist nor deathlessness then. There existed no sign of night  nor of day.
That One breathed without wind by its independent will. There existed  nothing else beyond that. 3. Darkness existed, hidden by darkness, in the beginning. All this was a  signless ocean.
What existed as a thing coming into being, concealed by emptinessâ€”that  One was born by the power of heat.
