[Yamī:] Desire for Yama has come to me, Yamī, to lie together in the  same womb [/place].
Like a wife to her husband I would yield my body. We would “let ’er rip”  like two chariot wheels. 8. [Yama:] They do not stand still; they do not blink—the spies of the  gods who roam about here.
With another than me, lubricious one, drive off straightaway; with him  “let ’er rip” like two chariot wheels.
