Very skillful through your skills, through your will you are strong-willed.  O Agni, you are the all-knowing poet through your poetic craft.
As good one, you alone hold sway over goods, which both Heaven and  Earth foster. 4. Foresightful, o Agni, you have settled down seasonably to your
ghee-rich womb, in the footprint of refreshment.
Your arrivals show brightly like those of the dawns, your reins spotless  like the rays of the sun.
