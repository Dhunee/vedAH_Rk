I put my trust in your foremost battle-fury, in that you smashed Vr̥tra  and labored at the manly work,
in that both world-halves yield to you and even earth trembles from your  tempest, o possessor of the stone. 2. You, faultless one, with your wiles shook wily Vr̥tra to pieces, with your  fame-seeking mind.
Just you do superior men choose in their quests for cattle, you when all  sacrifices are to be offered.
