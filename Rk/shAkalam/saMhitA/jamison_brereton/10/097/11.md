When I take these plants in my hand, invigorating them,
the very self of the sickness perishes, as if before being captured alive. 12. Him whose every limb, every joint you slither over,
from him thrust aside the sickness, like a mighty (man) lying in the middle. 13. Fly forth, o sickness, together with the cāṣa-bird and the kikidīví-bird. Perish together with the swoop of the wind and together with the
blizzard [?].
