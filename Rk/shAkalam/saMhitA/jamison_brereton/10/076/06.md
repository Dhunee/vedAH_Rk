Let the glorious ones clatter for us—let it press (soma) out of the stalk— the stones with their voice, (which is) heaven-bound, heavenly,
when the superior men milk the desirable honey for themselves, making  (Heaven and Earth) heed all about as they [=stones] cross each other  transversely. 7. The stones, the charioteers, press the soma. They milk out the juice of  him who seeks the cows.
They milk the udder, to pour it out. As superior men they groom (the  soma), like oblations, with their mouths.
