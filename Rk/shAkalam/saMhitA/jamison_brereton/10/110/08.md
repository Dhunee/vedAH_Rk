Let Bharatī come straightaway to our sacrifice, and Iḍā, making (us)  perceive here [=instructing us] as she did Manu.
Let the three goddesses, (those two and) Sarasvatī, the good workers, sit  here on this ritual grass, a comfortable place. 9. He who (adorned) Heaven and Earth, these two begetters, and who  adorned all the creatures with their forms,
to him today, to god Tvaṣṭar, o Hotar, superior sacrificer, perform
sacrifice here when prompted, as the knowing one.
