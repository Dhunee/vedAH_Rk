Let these turn back again. Let them prosper in (the care of) this man, the  lord of the cattle.
Right here, o Agni, fix them down fast. Here let it remain—our wealth. 4. Also the one who is the cowherd—I call him to the journeying back, the  coming back, the bringing to agreement, and the going away,
to the turning here and the turning back.
