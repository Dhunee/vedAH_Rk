O Lady of the Wilderness, Lady of the Wilderness, you there, who seem  to be lost just ahead.
How is that you donâ€™t ask for the village? Does fear not find you at all? 2. When the ciccika (bird?/bug?) helps out the bull-roarer [=frog? bird?] as it  speaks,
the Lady of the Wilderness displays her greatness like (a king?) who
hurtles along amid the clash of cymbals.
