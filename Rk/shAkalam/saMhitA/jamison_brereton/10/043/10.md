With cows we would overcome neglect that goes ill, and with barley we  would overcome all hunger, o you who are much invoked.
With our kings and our community might we be the first to win the stakes. 11. Let Indra, lord of the formulation, protect us all around, from behind  and from above and from below, from him who wishes illâ€”
from in front and from the middle. Let him, as partner, create wide
space for his partners.
