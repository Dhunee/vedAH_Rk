As the god encompassing the gods in accordance with truth, first convey  our oblation, as the observant one,
possessing a beacon of smoke, foaming with radiance by kindling, you,  the gladdening constant Hotar, who sacrifice better with your speech. 3. It’s the god’s own acquisition: the immortal (drink) that comes from the  cow. “Those born therefrom uphold the two wide (worlds)”—
this sacrificial formula of yours do all the gods follow, when the speckled  (cow) gives as her milk the heavenly ghee, the water.
