This spear of yours has been fixed among us, Indra; the Maruts speed the  formless (cloud) mass, with all its gear.
For even a fire blazing in the brushwood can produce pleasurable
offerings, as waters do an island. 4. You, Indra—give us wealth, like a present in the form of a most
formidable priestly gift cow.
And the praises that will be enjoyable to you and to Vāyu will swell with  victory-prizes, as (priestly gift cows) swell their breast of honey.
