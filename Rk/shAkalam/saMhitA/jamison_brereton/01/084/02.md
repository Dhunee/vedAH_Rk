The two fallow bays convey Indra of irresistible strength
up to the praises of the seers and to the sacrifice of the sons of Manu. 3. Mount the chariot, VrÌ¥tra-smasher: your two fallow bays have been  yoked with a sacred formulation.
Let the pressing stone with its call make your mind inclined hither.
