Because these two, Heaven and Earth, beneficial to all, truthful, are those  who uphold the poet of the airy realm,
he speeds between the two Holy Places of good birth—the god, the  blazing Sun, between the two goddesses, according to his ordinance. 2. The two great ones of broad expanse, inexhaustible, the father and  mother, protect living beings—
the two world-halves, the very boldest ones, who are like (girls) inviting  admiration, when their father has decked them out with their forms. 3. That draft-horse, the son of the two fathers, the insightful one
provided with the means of purification purifies living beings by his  magical power.
Out of the dappled cow and the bull possessing good semen he has
milked his blazing milk all the days.
