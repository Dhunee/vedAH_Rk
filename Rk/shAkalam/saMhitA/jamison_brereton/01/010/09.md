You of listening ear, listen to our call: now accept my songs.
Indra, make this praise song of mine closer even than your yokemate. 10. Since we know you as the best of bulls, who listen to calls when prizes  (are at stake),
we call for the help of the best of bulls, the help that best wins a thousand. 11. O Indra, (god) of Ku≈õika, finding exhilaration, drink our pressed soma. Lengthen our lifetime anew; make the seer the winner of a thousand. 12. Let these songs surround you on every side, o you who long for songs. Let strengths accompany the one whose lifetime has been strengthened;  let enjoyments be enjoyed (by him).
