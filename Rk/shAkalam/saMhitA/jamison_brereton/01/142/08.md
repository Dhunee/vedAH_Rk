Let the two Divine Hotars, poets possessing gladdening tongues and  offering welcome,
perform this sacrifice for us today, (so it) reaches its goal and touches  heaven. 9. Let gleaming Hotrā Bhāratī [/the Oblation of the Bharatas], fitted in her  place among the gods, among the Maruts,
(also) Iḷā and great Sarasvatī, (all) worthy of the sacrifice, sit on the  ritual grass.
