title = "Section 1-50"

+++
The first fifty hymns, attributed to six different groups of poets, constitute the later stratum. They are primarily  in dimeter meter, sometimes arranged in tr̥cas, and the Kaṇva affiliation of a number of the poets connects this section with Maṇḍala VIII.

- 1–11 Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra (etc.)
- 12–23 Medhātithi Kāṇva
- 24–30 Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti
- 31–35 Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
- 36–43 Kaṇva Ghaura
- 44–50 Praskaṇva Kāṇva

For the most part the poetry is not particularly inspired and has a narrow liturgical  focus, especially in the first few collections. The major exception is the brief series  attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa, all in trimeter meter. This sequence contains  one of the most famous hymns in the R̥gveda, I.32, the clearest treatment of the  Indra-Vr̥tra myth and a poetic masterwork, as well as I.33, less celebrated but displaying equal poetic skill.+++(5)+++
