You, o Agni, kindled here in the house as their own, do men attend on in  their fixed abodes.
They deposited abundant heavenly brilliance within him. Become the  foundation of riches for your whole lifetime! 5. Might the bounteous ones reach nourishments, o Agni, and (might) the  patrons who give (reach) through a whole lifetime.
Might we gain the victory-prize in our clashes with the stranger,
acquiring a portion among the gods for our fame.
