Aditi, the milk-cow, swells for truth and for the person who gives  offerings, o Mitra and Varuá¹‡a,
when serving you at the ceremony, he spurs you two on. The one upon  whom the oblation is bestowed [=Agni] is like the human Hotar. 4. When the clans are to be exhilarated, the cows and the goddess Waters  swell the (soma) stalk for you,
and the lord of this house of ours is foremost. Pursue (the rite); drink of  the milk of the ruddy cow.
