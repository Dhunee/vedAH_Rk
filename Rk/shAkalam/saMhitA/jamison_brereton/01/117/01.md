The age-old Hotar [=Agni] seeks to win you in order for you to be  exhilarated on the honeyed soma, o Aśvins.
The gift accompanied by the ritual grass is laid out, (as is) my song. With  refreshment, with prizes of victory, journey here, o Nāsatyas. 2. Your chariot, o Aśvins, swifter than mind, drawn by good horses, comes  to the clans.
By which (chariot) you go to the home of the good ritual performer, by  that, o men, travel your course to us.
