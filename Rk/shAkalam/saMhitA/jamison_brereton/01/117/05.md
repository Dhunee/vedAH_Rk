Like one who has gone to sleep in the lap of destruction, like the sun  dwelling in darkness, o wondrous ones,
like a buried gem, lovely to see, (dug out) for beauty, you dug him
[=Vandana] out for Vandana [/for our celebration of you], o Aśvins. 6. This (deed) of yours in your earth-encircling course, o men, deserves to  be praised by Kakṣīvant, the son of Pajra, o Nāsatyas:
from the hoof of your prizewinning horse, you poured a hundred pots  of honey for the people.
