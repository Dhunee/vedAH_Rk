In comradeship with you who control the prizes, o Indra, let us not fear,  o lord of power.
We keep crying out to you, the conqueror who is not to be conquered. 3. Many are the gifts of Indra; his forms of help do not become exhausted when he grants to his praisers the bounty of a prize consisting of cattle. 4. He was born as a splitter of strongholds, a youthful poet, possessed of  immeasurable power.
Indra is the sustainer of every deed, the much-praised wielder of the mace. 5. You uncovered the opening of Vala filled with cattle, o possessor of  the stone.
Before the fearless one [=Vala?], the gods, though being pushed back,  came to your aid.
