You, mighty Maruts, you invulnerable band—with kind attention deliver  us to your benevolence.
Where your missile with its gory teeth scrapes (a path), mightily it
liquefies (the trees) as a well-placed (goad) sets the livestock flowing. 7. (The Maruts) whose generosity is (as steady as) a pillar, whose gifts are  not withdrawn, the restless ones, well-praised at the rites—
they chant forth the chant for the drinking of the exhilarating (soma);  they know the foremost manly deeds of the hero [=Indra].
