This billy-goat, belonging to all the gods, is led in front, along with the  prizewinning horse, as Pūṣan’s portion.
When (they lead the goat) as the pleasing fore-offering along with the  steed, it is Tvaṣṭar himself who stimulates him for (the deed) that
brings good fame. 4. When the sons of Manu lead around the horse to be offered three times  along (the path) that goes to the gods in proper order,
then the goat, Pūṣan’s portion, goes first, announcing the sacrifice to  the gods.
