O Vāyu, drive beyond sleeper after sleeper. Where the pressing stone  speaks, you two go there—(you) and Indra, go to that house.
Liberality has been sighted; the ghee is flowing. With a full team you two  drive to the ceremony—(you) and Indra drive to the ceremony. 8. Just now you two travel to the poured offering of honey. The victorious  ones [=soma drinks? Maruts?] that approach the fig tree—let these be  victorious for us.
All at once the cows give birth and the grain ripens; the milk-cows do  not give out for you, o Vāyu—the milk-cows do not give up.
