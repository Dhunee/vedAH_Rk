Since King Varuá¹‡a made a broad path for the sun to follow,
he has created two feet for the footless (sun) to give it support, and he  exorcises even what pierces the heart. 9. A hundred healers are yours, o king, a thousand. Let your favor be  broad and deep.
Drive dissolution far away into the distance. Release from us even the  guilt we have created.
