You, Agni—for us to win the stakes, make our bard glorious while you  are being praised.
Might we bring to fulfillment the (ritual) act through a new (poetic)  worker. O Heaven and Earth, along with the gods—help us. 9. You, Agni, in the lap of your two parents, the god wakeful among the  gods, o faultless one—
become body-creator [=father] and (fatherly) solicitude for our bard.  You, lovely one, have strewn every good thing here.
