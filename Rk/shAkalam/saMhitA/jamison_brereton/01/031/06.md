You, Agni, in fellowship at the ceremony safely bring the man
on the twisting turns (of the ritual “racecourse”) to the end, o
unbounded one,
you who—at the contest of champions, at the crucial turn, when the  stake (is set)—even with just a few you smash the greater in the clash. 7. You, Agni, establish that mortal in highest immortality for fame day  after day,
you who, yourself thirsting, create refreshment for both breeds [=men  and gods] and a pleasurable meal here for the patron.
