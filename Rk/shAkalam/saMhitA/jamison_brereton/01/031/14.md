You, Agni, (are kindled as protector) for the cantor chanting far  and wide. What is the highest legacy worth seekingâ€”that you win
(for him).
Even of the feeble you are called (fatherly) solicitude and father. You
instruct the simple, (instruct) the quarters, as the one who knows better. 15. You, Agni, like (well-)stitched armor, protect all around the man whose  priestly gift has been proffered.
Whoever (as host), serving sweet food, providing a comfortable place  in his dwelling, performs the sacrifice of a living thing, he is the very  measure of heaven.
