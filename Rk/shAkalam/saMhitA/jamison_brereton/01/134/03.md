Vāyu yokes his chestnut pair, Vāyu his ruddy pair, Vāyu the two nimble  ones to the chariot, to the chariot-pole to pull—the best pullers to the  chariot-pole to pull.

For you will the milk-cow, milking her juice, milk out all good things. You begat the Maruts from the belly—from the belly of heaven.
