title = "Hymns 12–23"

+++
12–23 are attributed to Medhātithi Kāṇva, also supposedly the poet of some  verses in the early hymns of Maṇḍala VIII, a predominately Kāṇva book, as well  as the second hymn of the Soma Maṇḍala (IX.2). The Medhātithi First Maṇḍala  hymns here are all in gāyatrī meter, save for some stray verses in I.17 and 23. They  are dedicated to a variety of deities; in fact, each hymn has a different divinity or  set of divinities. The poet has a particular penchant for dedicands in pairs (Indra  and Varuṇa I.17, Agni and the Maruts I.19, Indra and Agni I.21) or groups (Viśve  Devāḥ I.14, R̥bhus I.20, variety of divinities I.13, 15, 22–23), and in the group  hymns a high proportion follow particular ritual litanies: Āprī (I.13), R̥tugrahas  (I.15), Praügaśastra (I.23).
