Because the clans together kindle you as Hotar who provides all  possessions [/possesses all knowledge],
o much-invoked Agni, bring the discerning gods here at a run— 8. Savitar, Dawn, the Aśvins, Bhaga. Through the nights, when the  dawns break,
the Kaṇvas, their soma pressed, kindle you, Agni, as conveyor of the  oblation, o you of good ceremony.
