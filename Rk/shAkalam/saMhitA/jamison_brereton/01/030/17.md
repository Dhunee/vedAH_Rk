O Aśvins, drive here with your drink providing powerful refreshment  and accompanied by horses
(along your circuit) that brings cows and gold, o wondrous ones. 18. For your immortal chariot, (always) taking the same route,
speeds upon the sea, o wondrous Aśvins. 19. You two anchored (one) wheel of your chariot on the head of the  inviolable (bull);
the other speeds around heaven.
