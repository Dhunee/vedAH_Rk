With a desire for gain I hasten for you with homage to Dawn and Night,  (who are) like a cow that is easily milked,
as in one and the same day I measure out my chant in milk of dissimilar  forms (though found) in the same udder. 5. And let Ahi Budhnya create joy for us. As a (cow) swelling (with milk)  pursues her young, the River pursues (the hymn?)
with which we will speed the Child of the Waters, whom the bulls
having the speed of thought convey.
