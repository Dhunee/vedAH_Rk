You brought here the two tawny (horses) attained from great heaven,  as you were battling for the wellspring (of soma), which was
overwhelming in heavenly brilliance,
when for you to grow strong they milked with stones the exhilarating  tawny (soma), that was frenzied for cows [=milk], befriended by
the wind. 9. Ingenious, you rolled back from the cow the metallic stone of heaven,  which had been brought nearby,
when, o much-invoked one, vanquishing Śuṣṇa, you kept encircling him  with endless deadly weapons.
