Just that tree on which all the honey-eating, well-feathered ones settle  and give birth,
they say, has the sweet fig at its top. He who does not know the father  will not reach up to that. 23. How the gāyatrī (track) [=gāyatrī line] is based upon a gāyatrī (hymn) or  how a triṣṭubh (track) [=triṣṭubh line] was fashioned out of a triṣṭubh  (hymn),
or how the jagat track [=jagatī line] is based on the jagat [=jagatī]
(hymn)—only those who know this have reached immortality.
