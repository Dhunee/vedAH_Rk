O you of bold mind, at the far edge of this dusky realm and of distant  heaven with the might natural to you
you have made the earth the counterpart of your might for our help.  Encompassing the waters and the sun, you go all the way to heaven. 13. You have become the counterpart of earth and you became the lord of  high (heaven) containing lofty heroes.
You filled the whole midspace with your greatness. This is certainly  true: there is no other like you.
