title = "Section 51-191"

+++
The second and far longer part of Maṇḍala I (51–191) consists of hymns attributed to nine groups of poets:

- 51–57 Savya Āṅgirasa
- 58–64 Nodhas Gautama
- 65–73 Parāśara Śāktya
- 74–93 Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
- 94–115 Kutsa Āṅgirasa (etc.)
- 116–126 Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
- 127–139 Paruchepa Daivodāsi
- 140–164 Dīrghatamas Aucathya
- 165–191 Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi

A number of these poets have quite distinctive stylistic personalities and thematic  preoccupations, and their collections contain some of the most glorious poetry in  the R̥gveda. Some of the hymns are quite famous (e.g., I.164, the “riddle hymn”; I.179, the dialogue between the seer Agastya and his impatiently amorous wife  Lopāmudrā), but there are many treasures to be unearthed among the lesser known  hymns.+++(5)+++ We refer the reader to the introductions to the various hymn collections and  their individual hymns.
