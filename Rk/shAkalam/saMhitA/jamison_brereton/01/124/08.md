The (one) sister has left the natal place to her older sister. She goes away  from her, like (a girl) to be gazed upon.
Dawning forth with the rays of the sun, she smears unguent on herself,  like (maidens) with a choice going to assemblies. 9. Day after day the latest of those earlier sisters advances from behind  toward the earlier one.
Let the newer ones now dawn richly for us as of oldâ€”the
day-bright dawns.
