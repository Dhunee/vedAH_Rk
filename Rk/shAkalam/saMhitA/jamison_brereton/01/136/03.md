Light-filled, sunlit Aditi who upholds the communities do the two  accompany every day—being wakeful every day.
Light-filled dominion do they acquire—the two Ādityas, lords of the drop. Of these two Mitra (is the one who by nature) sets the peoples in order,  but Varuṇa (does as well)—(also) Aryaman sets the peoples in order. 4. Let the one here, this soma, be most wealful for Mitra and Varuṇa, the  one who gives shares in the drinking places—the god who gives shares  to the gods.
Him should the gods enjoy, all of them today in joint enjoyment.
O kings, you shall do just as we beg—you truthful ones, as we beg.
