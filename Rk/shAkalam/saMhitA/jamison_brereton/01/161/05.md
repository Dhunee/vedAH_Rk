When Tvaṣṭar said, “We shall smash those who have insulted the cup  that gives drink to the gods”—
they [=the R̥bhus] make other names for themselves during the  soma-pressing—by their other names the maiden will rescue them. 6. Indra has hitched up his two fallow bays, and the Aśvins their chariot.  Br̥haspati drove near (the cow) of all forms.
You—R̥bhu, Vibhvan, and Vāja—went to the gods. By your skillful  work you came to a share in the sacrifice.
