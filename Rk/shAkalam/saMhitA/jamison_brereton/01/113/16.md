Raise yourselves up! The living life-force has come here to us. Away,  forth has gone the darkness; light comes hither.
She has left a path for the sun to drive on. We have come to where they  lengthen lifetime. 17. With reins of speech the conveyor (of oblations), the hoarse-voiced  (singer) [=Agni], himself being praised, arouses the radiant dawns.
Today then, o bounteous one, dawn for the one who sings; for us shine  down a lifetime full of offspring.
