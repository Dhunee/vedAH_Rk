It has appeared, wondrous ones: you two unclose the firmament;  your chariot-horses are yoked at the rituals of daybreak—the
unbesmirched ones at the rituals of daybreak.
Your station is on your chariot box, on your golden chariot,
wondrous ones—
(you two) going as if on a path, directing (the chariot) through the  dusky realm—directing (it) straightway through the dusky realm. 5. With your powers, you two whose goods are powers, favor us by day  and by night.
Let your giving never give out—let your giving never give out from us. 6. O bull Indra—these pressed drops, the drink of a bull, pressed by the  stones, are bursting out—for you are the pressed (drops) bursting  out.
Let them invigorate you to giving, to great, glittering generosity. Being praised with songs, you whose vehicle is songs, come here—very  compassionate to us, come here.
