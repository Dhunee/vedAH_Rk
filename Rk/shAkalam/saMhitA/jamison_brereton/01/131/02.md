Because at all pressings those of bullish fervor thrust you forward, (each  of them) separately (thrusts you who are) one and the same—those
seeking to win the sun, (each) separately—
you, like a boat of deliverance, we would place at the chariot-pole of our  forceful (song),
making Indra take notice (of us) with our sacrifices as the Āyus did—as  the Āyus did Indra with their praises. 3. Those seeking aid, paired in opposition, have yanked you back and  forth, at the winning of the cowpen, as they set (the cows) free—being  victorious (over the cowpen), as they set (them) free, o Indra—
when you shove together the two peoples who are seeking cows and  going to (the winning of) the sun,
as you constantly display the bull partnered with (you)—the mace
partnered with (you), Indra.
