Since then they have constantly celebrated this manly deed of yours at  the revels: that, o bull, you aided the fire-priests—that you aided those  acting as comrades.
You made “Game,” for them to prevail in battles.
They kept winning one river after another—seeking fame they kept winning. 6. And now take note of this dawn—for one should enjoy it—of our chant,  of our oblation along with our invocations—at the winning of the
sun, along with our invocations.
When, o Indra, possessor of the mace, as bull you will have in view to  smash the negligent ones,
(listen) to me, this newer ritual adept—listen to the thought of (me), the  newer one.
