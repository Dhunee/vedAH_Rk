title = "Ritual focus"

The style and contents of these hymns are for the most part elementary, even  banal, and there is generally a strong focus on purely ritual matters, to the virtual  exclusion of description, mythological references, praise, and even requests for aid  and gifts. In short, a poetically uninspiring collection, but the information it gives  about the early shape of later ritual litanies is valuable.
