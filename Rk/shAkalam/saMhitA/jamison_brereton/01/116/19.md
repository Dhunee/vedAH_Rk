Conveying wealth with good rule and a full lifetime with good  descendants and good men, N캐satyas,
you two of one mind journeyed here with the prizes of victory to the  wife of Jahnu, who was setting your portion three times a day. 20. At night you conveyed J캐hu攷므, besieged from every direction, through  the easily traversed airy spaces.
With your chariot that cuts asunder, o never-aging N캐satyas, you
journeyed through the mountains.
