You, Indra, released the rivers to flow at will to the sea, like chariots— like prize-seeking chariots.
The enduring (rivers) hitched themselves up toward the same
imperishable goal,
like milk-cows yielding all milk for Manu—yielding all milk for the people. 6. This speech have the goods-seeking Āyus fashioned for you, like a clever  artisan a chariot—they have fashioned you for favor,
adorning (you / the speech), you inspired poet, like a thoroughbred,  prize-seeking horse at the contests for prizes,
like a steed for power, for winning riches—for winning all riches.
