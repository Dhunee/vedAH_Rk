Harness that which is swifter than mind, which has a triple chariot-box  and three wheels, o bulls,
with which you drive right up to the dwelling of the good performer (of  rituals). You fly with the tripartite (chariot) like a bird with its feathers. 2. The smooth-rolling chariot rolls on as it goes toward earth, when you  stand on it, resolved to fortify (us).
Let this hymn here accompany the wonder with wonderment; you keep  company with Dawn, the Daughter of Heaven.
