Once you had smashed those who rout their allies, and had smashed the  impious when you were strengthened by the stimulant, o Indra of the  fallow bays,
those who saw before them Aryaman in company with these two [=Mitra  and Varuṇa], they were shattered by you, taking their progeny along. 7. The sage poet [=Uśanā Kāvya?] murmured, o Indra, at the winning  of the chants [/(sun’s) rays]: “He has made the earth a pillow for
the Dāsa.
The bounteous one will make the three (worlds?) bright with drops; he  has embedded in a woeful womb the one who speaks evil in scorn.” 8. These are your old (deeds), Indra; new ones have come: you
overpowered and exploded the many (strongholds) for the lack of joy  [/end of battle] (of the godless).
You split the godless (clans) into pieces, like strongholds; you bowed  the weapon of the godless reviler.
