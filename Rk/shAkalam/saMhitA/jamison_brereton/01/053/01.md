Let us bring forward our speech for the great one, our songs for Indra, at  the seat of Vivasvant,
for never has anyone found a treasure among those who are, as it were,  asleep. A poor praise hymn is not acclaimed among the givers of wealth. 2. O Indra, you are the one who breaks out the horse, breaks out the  cow, breaks out the grain, since you are the forceful lord of (every)
good thing.
He who from of old does his best for men, who does not short their  desires, a comrade to his comradesâ€”to him we now sing.
