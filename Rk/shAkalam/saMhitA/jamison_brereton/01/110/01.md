My (ritual) work has been stretched out, and it is being stretched out  again. My sweetest insight is being recited for a hymn.

Right here is the sea (of soma) belonging to the All Gods. Satiate
yourselves together on the (soma) prepared with the svāhā-cry, o R̥bhus. 2. When, facing front, you shrewd ones went forth in search of your daily  bread, kind of like my pals,
o sons of Sudhanvan, after your fill of roaming you came to the house  of Savitar the pious.
