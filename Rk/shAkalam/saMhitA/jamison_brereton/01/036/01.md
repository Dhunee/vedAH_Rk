We appeal for you with well-spoken speeches to the youthfully exuberant  (fire) of the many (peoples), of the clans that serve the gods,
to Agniâ€”just the one whom the others (also) reverently invoke. 2. The peoples have installed Agni, the increaser of might. Bringing  oblations, we would do honor to you.
Become today our benevolent helper here when prizes (are at stake), o  comrade.
