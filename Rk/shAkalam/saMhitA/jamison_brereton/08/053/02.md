You who set Āyu, Kutsa, Atithigva to shaking, while growing stronger  every day,
you do we invoke, seeking prizes—you of the fallow bay horses,
possessing a hundred resolves. 3. Let the stones pour out the honey’s juice of all of us—
the drops that have been pressed in the distance among (other) peoples,  and those that have been pressed nearby.
