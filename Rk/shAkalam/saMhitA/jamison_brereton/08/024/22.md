Like Vyaśva, praise Indra, who controls the prizewinning (horse) that  rides the wave,
liberally apportioning the property of the stranger to the pious man. 23. In just this way now, o Vaiyaśva, praise him anew [/to the nines, and  then] a tenth time—
the one who knows well, worthy to be celebrated by those who roam. 24. For you know how to avoid calamities day after day, o you with mace  in hand,
as a preener [=water bird] does snares.
