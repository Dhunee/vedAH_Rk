He who distributes all goods, the gladdening Hotar of the peoplesâ€” like the cups of honey that go first to him, the praises go forth to Agni. 7. Those of good gifts, seeking the gods, groom (you), the charioteer (of  the ceremonies), like a horse, with hymns.
Deliver both our progeny and our posterity (to safety), o wondrous  clanlord; deliver (to us) the generosity of the bounteous ones.
