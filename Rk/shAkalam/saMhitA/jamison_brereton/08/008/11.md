From there drive here with your chariot with its thousandfold raiment,  o Aśvins.
Vatsa has recited for you his honeyed speech—he a poet, son of a poet. 12. The two delightful to many who bring many good things, the two  minders of riches,
the Aśvins, as draft-animals, have bellowed out to this praise song
of mine.
