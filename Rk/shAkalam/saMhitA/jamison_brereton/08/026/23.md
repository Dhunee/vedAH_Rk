Kindly Vāyu, journey here from heaven. Drive your good horse-flesh; drive from great (heaven) the two broad-winged (horses) at the chariot. 24. For we call you to the seats of men (to be) the first to attain delight (as we call) the horse-backed pressing stone—(call you) along with your  munificence.
