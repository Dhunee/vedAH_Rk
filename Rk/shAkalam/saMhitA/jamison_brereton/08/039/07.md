Agni is joined with goods among the gods, among the clans devoted to  sacrifice.
With delight he fosters the many poetic arts, as the earth (fosters)
everything—the god devoted to sacrifice among the gods.
– Let all the other squirts burst! 8. Agni, who, belonging to the seven human (divisions), is fixed amid all  the rivers—
to him have we come—the one with three dwellings, the best smasher of  Dasyus for Mandhātar, Agni foremost in the sacrifices.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
