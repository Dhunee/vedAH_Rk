Set your auspicious mind on the overcoming of obstacles, the mind  with which you will be overpowering in battles.
Loosen the sturdy (bows) of those that are greatly defiant. Might we  win with your superior powers. 21. With my hymn I reverently invoke the one established by Manu, the  circle of spokes whom the gods have set down as their messenger,
the best sacrificer, who carries the oblations.
