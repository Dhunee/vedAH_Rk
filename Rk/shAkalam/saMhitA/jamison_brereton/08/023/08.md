Him of unerring will, whom, together with his body, they sweeten with  their sacrifices,
him, like an ally, well established among the people who abide in truth. 9. O you (people) who seek truth—in him abiding in truth, bringing success  to the sacrifice with our hymn,
in him do they [=the gods] take pleasure, in the footprint of our homage. 10. Let our sacrifices come in unbroken sequence here to the best of the  Aṅgirases,
who is the most glorious Hotar here among the clans.
