For your fangs are not to be withstood when you spread yourself out, o  bullish Agni.
Make our oblation well poured, o Hotar. Win for us many things worth  choosing. 15. You lie in the pieces of wood and in your two mothers [=kindling  sticks]; the mortals kindle you.
Tireless, you convey the oblations of him who makes oblation. Right  after that you shine [/rule] among the gods.
