Aśvins
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Renou (EVP XVI:  68)  deems this hymn “elementary,” and indeed the hymn  reduces the divine–human interaction to its simplest dimensions—the refrain  promising the gods ritual offerings and the rest of the verse sketching the poet’s  invitation, the gods’ journey, and the returns desired. The poet identifies himself  twice (vss. 3–4).

to drink of the honeyed soma.1184 VIII.86
