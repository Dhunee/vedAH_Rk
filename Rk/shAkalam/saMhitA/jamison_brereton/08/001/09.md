Those of yours which bring ten cows, which bring a hundred, a
thousand,
those horses of yours which are swift-running bulls, with these come  swiftly to us. 10. Today I summon the juice-yielding (cow), pulsing with excitement from  the songs,
Indra, the good milker, the lead milk-cow, the broad-streamed
refreshment, who gets it right.
