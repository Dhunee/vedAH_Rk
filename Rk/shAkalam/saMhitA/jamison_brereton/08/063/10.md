Seeking help as we present this (praise hymn), through you (all) might  we have skill as our father
for the strengthening of the one accompanied by the Maruts [=Indra]. 11. Yes indeed! through our chanters we cry out again and again for your  establishment according to the ritual sequence, o champion.
Let us conquer with you as our yokemate, Indra.
