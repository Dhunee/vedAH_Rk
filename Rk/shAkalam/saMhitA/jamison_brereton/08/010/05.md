If today you are in the west, if in the east, o Aśvins whose goods are  prizewinning mares,
if with Druhyu, Anu, Turvaśa or Yadu, I call upon you—so come to me. 6. If you are flying in the midspace or if along these two world-halves, o  you who provide many benefits,
or if, after your wont, you are standing upon your chariot, from there  drive here, o Aśvins.
