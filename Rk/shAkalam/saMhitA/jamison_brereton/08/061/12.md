We have yoked the strong one, victorious in battles, the undeceivable  one who wants what he’s owed.
The winner, the best charioteer recognizes a prizewinning (racehorse),  even when it’s a blur—which is just the one he will attain. 13. Whatever we are afraid of, Indra, make us unafraid of that.
Bounteous one, exert your ability then through your help for us. Smash  away hatreds, away slights.
