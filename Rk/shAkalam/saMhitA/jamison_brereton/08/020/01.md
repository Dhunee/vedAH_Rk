Come here; don’t mean harm. Setting out, don’t stay away, o you of  equal spirit,
who are able to bow even the fixed things. 2. With your (chariots) whose wheel-rims are firm, with your very bright  lights—o Maruts, masters of the R̥bhus, o Rudras—
with refreshment come here to us today, here to the sacrifice, seeking  the Sobharis, o you who are craved by many.
