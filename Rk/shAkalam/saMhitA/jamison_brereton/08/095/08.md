O Indraâ€”cleansed, come here to us; (come) cleansed with cleansed help. Cleansed, lay down a foundation of wealth; cleansed, become
exhilarated as the one deserving of soma. 9. For, o Indra, cleansed, (you lay down) wealth for us, cleansed, (you lay  down) treasures for the pious man.
Cleansed, you keep smashing obstacles, cleansed, you seek to gain
the prize.
