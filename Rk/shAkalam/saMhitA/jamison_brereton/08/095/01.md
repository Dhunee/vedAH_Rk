Like a charioteer (his chariot), the songs have mounted you at the  pressings, o you who long for songs.
In unison they have bellowed to you, Indra, like mothers to their calf. 2. The clear pressed (soma drinks) have roused you hither, o Indra who  long for songs.
Drink of this stalk, Indra: it has been set for you among all (the clans). 3. Drink the soma for exhilaration, Indra, the pressed soma brought by the  falcon,
for you are the lord, the king of each and every clan.
