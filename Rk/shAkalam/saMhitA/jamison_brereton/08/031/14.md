Agni, the foremost god of the good ones do I invoke for you all with  a hymn—
(I and you all) serving him, dear to many, like an ally who brings
success to the cultivated lands. 15. Quick is the chariot of the one with god on his side, or a champion in  battles of every sort.
– Just he who, as sacrificer, seeks to attain the mind of the gods will
surpass non-sacrificers.
