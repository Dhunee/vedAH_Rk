He who is the giver of goods to us, that Indra we invoke,
for we know his ever newer favor. Might we go to a pen full of cattle. 6. He to whom you exert yourself to give, o good one, that one achieves  the thriving of wealth.
We, who have pressed (the soma), invoke you, o bounteous Indra who  longs for songs.
