There are many high points and striking features in this sprawling maṇḍala, of  which we can mention only a few. 

From a ritual point of view, VIII.31, which treats  the household pair, provides the only clear R̥gvedic mention of the Sacrificer’s Wife,  whom we consider a ritual innovation in late R̥gveda. Another likely sociocultural  innovation, the explicit organization of the three Ārya varṇas, the social classes of  brahmin, kṣatriya, and vaiśya, is obliquely referred to in the trio of hymns VIII.35– 37. 

On the mythological side, the story of Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Emuṣa boar, found  in later brāhmaṇa texts, is mentioned several times in this maṇḍala, with a fairly  coherent account of it given in VIII.77. 

Perhaps the single most striking hymn in  VIII is the Apālā sūkta, VIII.91, in which a barely pubescent girl conducts a private  soma sacrifice for Indra. A particularly beautifully structured hymn is the All God  riddle hymn, VIII.29. 

Finally, one of the most salient features of the maṇḍala is the  number of dānastutis, including some of the most notable in the R̥gveda.

Although the first five hymns of VIII (VIII.1–5) are attributed to a variety of poets, as  Oldenberg discusses (1888: 214) they appear to belong together because of the similarity of the names of the poets assigned by the Anukramaṇī, the regular appearance  of a dānastuti, and the connection of the names of the Kaṇvas and Priyamedhas.
