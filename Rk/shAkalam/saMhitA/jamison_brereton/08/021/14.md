You never take on a rich man for companionship. The booze-fueled  revile you.
When you make your roar, you just shove (them all) together. It is  because of that that you are called on like a father. 15. When we are in companionship with one such as you, Indra, let us not,  like foolish (spinsters) who grow old at home,
(just) sit still when (the soma) has been pressed.
