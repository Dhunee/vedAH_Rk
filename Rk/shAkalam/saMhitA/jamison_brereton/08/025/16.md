This (Sun) here, as clanlord, gazes widely—the one (gazing) over  the many.
We proceed according to his commandments and yours [=Ādityas’]. 17. We follow the ancient accustomed ways of the one [=the Sun]  associated with the sovereign kings [=Ādityas],
the long-heard commandments of Mitra and of Varuṇa.
