O champion praised by many, whatever belonging to men you held dear  even before,
we assemble that for you, Indra: the sacrifice, the solemn word, and the  surpassing speech, 6. As well as the soma drinks for your exhilaration, o mace-wielder  invoked by many, heaven-ruling soma-drinker.
For you become the best giver of desirable goods to the creator of
sacred formulations, to the presser.
