Maṇḍala VIII is organized into small groups of hymns attributed to a single poet  or a set of closely related poets. Within each group, the hymns are organized by  divinity and meter and length of hymn. 

As noted in the general introduction, two  poetic lineages predominate, that of the Kāṇvas, especially in the first two-thirds of  the maṇḍala, and that of the Āṅgirases in the last third, although the Anukramaṇī attributes some hymns to poets belonging to neither lineage and in addition Kāṇva  hymns appear in the Āṅgirasa section and vice versa. The Kāṇva/Āṅgirasa identification links Maṇḍala VIII with Maṇḍala I, where poets of these families are prominent. 

Inserted in the middle of the maṇḍala are the apocryphal or “half-apocryphal”  Vālakhilya hymns (VIII.49–59), appearing between the sixth and seventh anuvākas  of the maṇḍala. Although these were supplements to the R̥gveda collection, they  were transmitted with it and transmitted with accents, unlike the other khilāni, the  other appendices to the saṃhitā text. 

For further on the structure and affiliations of VIII, see especially Oldenberg (1888: 209–19) and Hopkins (1896). Many of the hymns in VIII are made up of strophes consisting of two or three  verses (pragāthas and tr̥cas respectively), in various meters. Quite long hymns can  be thus assembled, and there is often more coherence within the strophes than  between the strophes. These strophic structures were especially associated with the  sung portions of the ritual, whose principal priest in the classic śrauta ritual was  the Udgātar, the priest of the Sāmaveda, into which many of the verses of Maṇḍala  VIII were borrowed. Thus the VIIIth Maṇḍala seems to have a liturgical function  somewhat separate from the rest of the saṃhitā.
