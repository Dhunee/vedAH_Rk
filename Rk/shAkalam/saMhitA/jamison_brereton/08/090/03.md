The unsurpassable sacred formulations are being performed for you, o  Indra who yearn for song.
Take pleasure in these “teams,” o possessor of fallow bays, which we  have thought up for you, Indra. 4. For you, bounteous one, the real thing who cannot be bowed, bear down  on many obstacles.
You, o strongest one with mace in hand—bring wealth nearby for the  pious man.
