On your shoulders spears, on your feet spangles; on your breasts  brilliants, o Maruts, on your chariot charms.
Lightning bolts with the flash of fire in your fists, golden (helmet-)lips  stretched out on your heads. 12. The vault whose brilliance is ungraspable for the stranger do you,  Maruts, shake for the gleaming fig [=rain].
The communities huddle together when (the Maruts) have grown
turbulent. The truth seekers sound an extended cry.
