You, o Agni, did they seat as the first guest of the clan, as the lord of the  house with blazing hair,
with lofty beacon and many forms, winning back the stakes, offering  good protection and good help, striving to bring (mortals) to old age. 3. You, o Agni, do the clans of Manuâ€™s sons invoke as the one knowing  priestly offices, discriminating, and best granting treasures,
being in hiding yet visible to all, o you who bring good fortune,
resounding mightily, sacrificing well, and having ghee as your
splendor.
