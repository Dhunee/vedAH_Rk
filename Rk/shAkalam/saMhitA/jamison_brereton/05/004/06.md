With your weapon send the Dasyu into hiding, while creating vigor for  your own body,
and thus protect us when the prize is at stake, o Agni, best of men, since  you bring the gods safely across, o child of strength. 7. We would do you honor, o Agni, with our recitations; we, with our  oblations, o pure one of auspicious flame.
For us speed wealth that fulfills all wishes; for us grant all goods.
