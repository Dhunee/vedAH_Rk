Agni is the Hotar of the dwelling rich in gifts, in which the ritual grass is  twisted,
upon whom sacrifices converge and the prizes and seekers of fame
(converge); 3. And to whom the churning stick has again given birth like a new calfâ€” Agni, the supporter of the clans of the sons of Manu, performing
good rites.
