Let the water-conveyors come here to you today, all the Maruts who  speed the rain.
This fire which is kindled here, o Maruts, enjoy it, you sage poets, youths. 4. You beget for the people a take-charge king, fashioned for distinction,  you who deserve the sacrifice.
From you comes the fist-fighter, quick with his arms, from you the one  of trusty horses and good heroes, o Maruts.
