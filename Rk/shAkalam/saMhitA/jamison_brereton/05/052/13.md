Which lofty ones, whose spears are lightning flashes, are (also) sage  poets, ritual adeptsâ€”
to this Marut flock, o seer, do homage and bring it to a halt with song. 14. To the Marut flock, o seer, (approach) with a gift, as a maiden being  given (in marriage) (approaches) her ally [=spouse?].
Or from heaven do you, bold ones, praised with poetic thoughts, speed  with strength.
