I chant for you to the men granting prosperity, to the Lord of the  Dwelling-Place, to Tvaṣṭar, as I give;
with reverences (I chant) to the trees, the plants, along with the rich Holy  Place, in the quest for wealth. 9. Let the mountains behave like family, to thrust out progeny for us— they who are like good heroes.
Āptya, admired, always worthy of our sacrifice, the manly one, will  strengthen our laud in preeminence.
