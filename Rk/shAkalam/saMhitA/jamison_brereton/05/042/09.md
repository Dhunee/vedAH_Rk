Dissipate the possessions of those who benefit by our hymns without giving. Those violating the commandments, grown strong at forward thrusting,  the haters of the sacred formulationâ€”keep them away from the sun. 10. Whoever lauds the demons at the invitation to the gods, run him over,  Maruts, with your wheel-less (chariots).
Whoever will scorn the labor of the one who labors for you, he will  render his own desires empty when he sweats (at ritual labor).
