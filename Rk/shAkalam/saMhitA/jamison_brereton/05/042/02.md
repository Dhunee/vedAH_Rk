May Aditi grab hold of my praise, like a mother the beloved son of  her heart.
The dear sacred formulation that has been established by the gods, that  is joy itself to Mitra and Varuṇa—may I (grab hold of it). 3. Rouse the best poet of poets. Wet him with honey, with ghee.
He—god Savitar—will propel to us the golden goods that have been  held forth and set out.
