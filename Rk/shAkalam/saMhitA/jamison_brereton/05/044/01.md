Him—in the primordial way, in the earlier way, in every way, in this way  here—(him who is) preeminence (itself), who sits on the ritual grass
and finds the sun,
him facing toward (our) community will you milk out with song, the swift  one conquering (the cows? the waters?), among whom you grow strong. 2. Lovely to be seen for beauty are those (tips [of flame/soma streams]),  which are the sun of the lower (realm). (As the possessor) of (those)  tips who shines forth (even) for the one who doesn’t impel (largesse), you are a good herdsman, not for deceiving, o strong-willed one. Far  beyond the trickeries of magic your name was (set) in truth.
