Spears are on your shoulders, Maruts; might, strength, power placed in  your arms.
Manly forces on your heads, weapons on your chariots. All splendor has  been emblazoned on your bodies. 7. Rich in cows, in horses, in chariots, in good heroes, in gold—(such)  largesse you have given to us, Maruts.
Make good our eulogy, Rudras. Might I have a share in your divine help. 8. – Hail, Maruts, superior men! Be merciful to us—o you of great bounty,  immortal, knowing the (immanent) truth,
hearing the realized (truth) [=poetic formulations], sage poets, youths,  belonging to the lofty mountains, loftily growing.
