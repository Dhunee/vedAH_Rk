Here are these two who appear most often, bringing their many
wondrous powers.
With longing for space, I beseech the pair who are not poor. I call upon  the two most powerful ones to give enjoyment. 3. You maintain at rest your chariot’s one wheel [=the sacrificial fire], the  marvel to be marveled at.
With the other (wheel) [=the sun?] you fly around the generations of  the descendants of Nahuṣa and the airy regions by your greatness.
