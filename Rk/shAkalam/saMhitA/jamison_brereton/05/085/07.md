O Varuṇa, the offense that we have committed against any partner, be he  one by alliance or one by custom, or against a brother,
or against a neighbor—whether native or foreign—o Varuṇa,
loosen that. 8. If (we have cheated) as gamblers cheat in a dice game, whether overtly or  whether we are unaware,
unbind all these things (so they will be) like loose things, o god. Then  would we be dear to you, Varuṇa.
