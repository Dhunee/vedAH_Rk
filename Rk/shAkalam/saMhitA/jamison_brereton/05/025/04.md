Agni is king among the gods and Agni among mortals when he enters  (among them).
Agni is the conveyor of oblations for us. Serve Agni with your insights. 5. Agni gives to the pious man an excellent son of very mighty fame and of  very mighty formulations,
one who cannot be overcome and who brings fame to his lord.
