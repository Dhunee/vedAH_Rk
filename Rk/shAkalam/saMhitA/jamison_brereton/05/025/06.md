Agni gives the lord of settlements who prevails in battle with his men; Agni (gives) the fast-running charger, the unvanquished victor. 7. What best conveys (offerings), that is for Agni. Chant (your chant) aloft,  o you of far-radiant goods.
Like a buffalo-cow wealth (arises) from you; victoryâ€™s prizes arise
from you.
