These (horses) of yours (will) not (remain) unyoked because of us [i.e.,  because of our failure], lofty Indra, if it’s for lack of a (yoking)
formulation.
Mount on the chariot with mace in hand. You with the good horses will  hold your own rein, o god. 4. Just as there are many hymns that exist for you, Indra, and many  are (the deeds) you have done for the cow, when fighting over the
meadows,
(and many [the paths]?) you carved out also for the sun in your [/his]  own home, as bull you (have carved out) even the names of the Dāsa  in the contests.
