Indra
Avasyu Ātreya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous Indra hymns in this maṇḍala, this hymn provides a survey  of Indra’s great deeds, with the ritual context for this recital made explicit  in verses 5–6 and Indra’s journey to the sacrifice sketched in verses 1–2. The  recital itself is fragmentary and mosaic-like, with glittering vignettes from  various myths juxtaposed unordered. This fragmented nature is enhanced by  abrupt switches between the past and the present/future (see, e.g., vss. 6, 11).  The stories of the chariot of the Sun (vs. 11)  and of Kutsa and Uśanā (vss.  7–10) encountered in V.29 recur here, vivid but enigmatic. The ritual context  returns in the final two verses, with Indra’s arrival at the sacrifice (12) and  prayers for Indra’s help (13). 1. Indra makes an easy slope for his chariot, the prize-seeking one, which  the bounteous one has mounted.
Like a herdsman separating the flocks of livestock, he keeps (his
chariot) separate (from the others). Invulnerable, he drives as the first  to seek winnings.
