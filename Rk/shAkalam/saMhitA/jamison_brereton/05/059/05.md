Like reddish horses [=flames of fire] they are of the same lineage, like  champions in the vanguard, they have fought in advance.
Like very strong young bloods, the men have grown strong. They
confound the eye of the sun with their rains. 6. They, bursting forth with no oldest one, no youngest, no middle, have  grown forth in their greatness.
Noble by birth, having Pr̥śni as mother, young bloods of heaven—come  here to us.
