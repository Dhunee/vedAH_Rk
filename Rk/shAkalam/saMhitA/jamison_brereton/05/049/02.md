In response to the advance of the lord, as a knowing one offer friendship  to god Savitar with hymns.
A discerning one should call on (him) with reverence and on the
preeminent one who apportions the treasure of Āyu. 3. Traveling to those lacking gifts, (each god) distributes valuables—Pūṣan,  Bhaga, Aditi—at the dawning of the ruddy (Dawn).
Indra, Viṣṇu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni—the wondrous ones beget lucky days. 4. Then Savitar without assault is our defense, then the nurturing rivers  follow suit,
when, as Hotar of the ceremony, I call upon (them). May we be lords of  wealth, with prizes as our treasure.
