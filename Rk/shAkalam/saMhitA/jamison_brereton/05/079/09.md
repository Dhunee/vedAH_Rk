Dawn forth, Daughter of Heaven. Don’t keep dragging out your work  over a long time,
lest the sun scorch you with his beam as (he might) a swindling thief – o well-born lady, liberal with horses. 10. So much you ought to give, o Dawn, or more—
you who, as you dawn, far-radiant one, do not dwindle for the praisers – o well-born lady, liberal with horses.
