Let this be gladdening to youâ€”the soma pressed here by the golden  (stones).
Rejoicing, Indra, come here to us along with your golden (horses).
Mount the golden chariot. 2. Being glad, you made the dawn beam; being glad, you made the
sun shine.
Knowing, observant, you wax strong over all the beauties, o Indra of the  golden horses.
