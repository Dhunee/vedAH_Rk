The milk-cow [=Dawn?] is yielding the desirable milk of the age-old  (semen); the son [=Agni] of the priestly gift acts as go-between.
She whose course is beautiful carries brightness here; the praise song of  Dawn has awakened the Aśvins. 2. In good harness, the ritual offerings—they come to be high above!— carry you two like parents back here by the truth.
Awaken because of us! We have put the poetic inspiration of the miser  away (from us) and put here the help of you two. Travel here this way. 3. With your well-harnessed horses and smooth-rolling chariot, wondrous  ones, hear this signal call of the pressing stone.
Is it not true that the inspired poets born long ago have said that you are  the first to respond to trouble, Aśvins?
