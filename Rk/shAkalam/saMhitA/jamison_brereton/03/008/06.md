Those of you whom the god-seeking men have fixed down, or, Lord of  the Forest, whom the axe has fashioned,
let those god(like) sacrificial posts, standing there, be disposed to place a  treasure consisting of offspring in us. 7. Those who, hewn, are on the earth, or have been fixed down in it, or  over whom the offering ladles have been outstretched,
let them pursue a thing of value for us among the gods, assuring
success to the cultivated lands.
