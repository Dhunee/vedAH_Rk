Mortals have begotten the immortal one, who is no miscarriage,  overwhelming, hard-jawed.
Joined together, ten unwed sisters [=fingers] embrace the male just born. 14. From of old, bringing the seven Hotars, he has shone forth in the lap of  his mother when he blazed upon her udder.
Day after day, greatly delighting, he does not blink after he has been  born from the belly of the lord.
