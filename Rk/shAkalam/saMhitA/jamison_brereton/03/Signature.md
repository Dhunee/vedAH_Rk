One of the distinctive characteristics of this maṇḍala is that its poets mark seven  of its Agni hymns (1, 5, 6, 7, 15, 22, and 23) and twelve of its Indra hymns (30, 31,  32, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 43, 48, 49, and 50) with a final verse that identifies the hymn as  a Vaiśvāmitra creation.+++(5)+++ Other poetic families also have such signature verses, but the  Viśvāmitras have one for their Agni hymns and a different one for the Indra hymns.
