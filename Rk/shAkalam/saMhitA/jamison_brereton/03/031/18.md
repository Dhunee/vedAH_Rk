Become lord of liberalities, you smasher of Vr̥tra, a bull of songs,  conferring vigor all the life long.
Come here to us with your friendly fellowship, a great one hastening  with great help. 19. Serving him with homage like the Aṅgirases, I make new (their hymn)  born of old, for the older one.
Run over the deceits, manifold and godless, and set us up to win the  sun, bounteous one.
