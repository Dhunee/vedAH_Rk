Surveying (the cows) en masse, they delighted in their own possession,  milking out the milk of the age-old semen.
Their cry heated the two worlds through. Amid (all) that was born they  set the outstanding one [=Indra?]; amid the cows they set heroes. 11. He was Vr̥tra-smasher with (the help of) those who were born (together)  [=Maruts], and he sent the ruddy (cows) surging upward with
oblations and with the chants (of the Aṅgirases)—he is Indra.
She of broad extent, bearing ghee-rich (milk) to him, milked out honey,  sweetness—the thoroughbred cow.
