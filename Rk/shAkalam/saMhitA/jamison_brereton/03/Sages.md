With a few exceptions, the hymns of Maṇḍala III belong to Viśvāmitra Gāthina  and other members of his family. Of the sixty-two hymns in the maṇḍala, the  Anukramaṇī states that Viśvāmitra himself composed all or parts of forty-six, along  with two others that might be his or that might belong to another poet (III.31, 38).  

The Anukramaṇī attributes four hymns in the Agni series (III.19–22) to Viśvāmitra’s  father, Gāthin Kauśika, and one Indra hymn (III.31) either to Viśvāmitra or to his  grandfather, Kuśika Aiṣīrathi. 

Vaiśvāmitras, Viśvāmitra’s sons or descendants, are  also represented in the maṇḍala: Kata (III.17–18), R̥ṣabha (III.13–14), and possi bly Prajāpati (III.38, 54–56), as is one grandson, Utkīla Kātya (III.15–16), the son  of Kata Vaiśvāmitra. 

Outside of III, a few verses (IX.67.13–15; X.137.5) and one  jointly composed hymn (X.167) are also attributed to Viśvāmitra. Likewise, other  Vaiśvāmitras appear among the composers of hymns in IX and X: Madhuchandas  (IX.1), Reṇu (IX.70, X.89), Aṣṭaka (X.104), and Pūraṇa (X.160). 

Among the  remaining poets of III mentioned by the Anukramaṇī are Devaśravas Bhārata and  Devavāta Bhārata, who, it says, together composed the Agni hymn, III.23. The  Anukramaṇī’s attribution may be drawn from the hymn itself, which mentions the  two. However, the Bhārata king Sudās was the patron of Viśvāmitra, and the inclusion of a hymn ostensibly by two Bhāratas may reflect the close connection between  the clans of the poet and the king.+++(5)+++
