To the goddess Dawn, radiating widely, proffer your well-twisted (hymn)  with reverence.
The honey-bringer has propped her leading edge upward in heaven. She  of delightful aspect has shone forth through the shining realms. 6. The truthful (daughter) of Heaven has been awakened by our chants  [/been perceived with her rays]. The wealthy lady has brightly mounted  the two world-halves.
Agni, you go begging Dawn for valuable property as she comes hither,  radiating widely.
