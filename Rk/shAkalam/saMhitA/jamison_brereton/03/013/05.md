The shining one who has none before him, Agni, together with his good  insights,
do the verse-reciters kindle as their Hotar and as the clanlord of the clans. 6. And you will help us in our sacred formulation and in our recitations as  the best of those that invoke the gods.
Growing strong through the Maruts, flame up as our good luck, Agni,  since you best win thousands (of cattle).
