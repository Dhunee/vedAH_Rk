Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: gāyatrī
Another straightforward hymn centered on the soma-drinking, very similar to the  immediately preceding III.41.
## 01
Come up to our pressed soma mixed with milk, Indra,
you who, with your pair of fallow bays, are seeking us.
## 02
Come, Indra, to the exhilarating drink, stationed on the ritual grass,  pressed by stones.
Will you now indeed sate yourself on it?
## 03
To Indra have my songs gone just so, sent from here,
to turn him hither for soma-drinking. 4. Indra we call here for soma-drinking with praises,
with hymns. Will he indeed come hither?
## 05
Indra! Here are the pressed soma-drinks. Put them
into your belly, o you of a hundred resolves, you rich in prizewinners. 6. Because we know you as one winning the stakes, as one daring in  prize-contests, you sage,
therefore we beg for your favor.
## 07
Drink this (soma) of ours mixed with milk and mixed with grain, Indra, having come here to the (soma) pressed by the bullish (stones).
## 08
Just to you, Indra, in my own house, do I impel the soma for drinking. Let it find pleasure in your heart.
## 09
You, Indra, do we call to drink the pressed drink, as of old—
we, the Kuśikas, seeking your favor.
