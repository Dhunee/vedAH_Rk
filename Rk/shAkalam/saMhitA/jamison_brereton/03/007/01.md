Those (flames) that have gone forth from the wellspring of white-backed  (Agni) have entered his mother and father and the seven voices.
The encircling father and mother [=Heaven and Earth] travel in tandem;  the two stretch far and wide to display their long lifetime. 2. The mares [=the flames?] of the bull, the ruler of heaven [=the sun], are  milk-cows; he took his place upon these goddesses, who convey that  filled with honey.
