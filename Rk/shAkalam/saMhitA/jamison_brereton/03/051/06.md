For you the sacred formulations, for you the songs altogether have been  established, o Indra of the fallow bays. Enjoy them!
Become a friend of help right now; o comrade, o good one, establish  vigor for the singers. 7. O Indra along with the Maruts, drink the soma here, as you drank of  the pressed (soma) beside Śāryāta.
With your guidance, in your shelter, o champion, the wise poets of
good sacrifices seek their win.
