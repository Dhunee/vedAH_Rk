The gray messenger [=smoke] keeps bearing down on them
[=hearths? plants?]. The great one acts the go-between through the
luminous realm.
Bearing wondrous forms, he looks out upon us. – Great is the one and  only lordship of the gods. 10. Viṣṇu, the cow-protector, protects the highest pen, establishing his own  dear, immortal domains.
Agni knows all these worlds. – Great is the one and only lordship of  the gods.
