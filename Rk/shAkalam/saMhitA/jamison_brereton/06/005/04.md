Whoever at a distance will assail us, whoever close by will be rapacious, o  Agni with Mitraâ€™s might,
with your own unaging bulls [=flames], most scorching one, scorch him  with your scorching heat, o you of scorching heat. 5. Whoever with sacrifice and with kindling wood, who with solemn  speeches and with chants will ritually serve you, o son of strength,
he, provident among mortals, o immortal one, shines out with wealth,  with brilliance, with fame.
