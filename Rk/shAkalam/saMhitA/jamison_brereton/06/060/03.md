O you two obstacle-smashers, with your obstacle-smashing tempests, o  Indra, drive our direction, o Agni, by reason of our reverences.
You two, with unstinting, highest bounties, o Indra, be here for us,
o Agni. 4. I call upon these two whose every previous deed is admired.
Indra and Agni do not neglect (us).
