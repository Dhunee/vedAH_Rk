God Savitar, who gives protection, should come hither to us—the  golden-palmed one deserving the sacrifice,
who, rich in gifts, like the face of Dawn discloses valuables to the pious. 9. And you, Son of Strength—you should turn the gods hither to us today  to this ceremony here.
Might I be always within (the sphere of) your giving; by your help might  I possess good heroes, Agni. 10. And you Nāsatyas should come here to my summons with your  insightful thoughts—you certainly are inspired poets.
(As you did) Atri from great darkness, release (me)—triumph, men!— from difficulty at close quarters.
