Although the Indra hymns outnumber the Agni hymns, the Indra hymns are,  for the most part, not terribly notable, though deftly executed. By contrast, the  Agni hymns specialize in imaginative descriptions of physical fire, and VI.9, a hymn  ostensibly dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara, contains one of the most striking meditations on the acquisition and employment of poetic craft in the R̥gveda. 

The hymn  VI.28, interrupting the Indra cycle, contains a charming blessing of the cows, and  the “clan” hymn, VI.48, repays the attention its difficulties demand. This hymn  contains, inter alia+++(=antar anyeṣu)+++, a remarkable, if cryptic, address to the god Pūṣan, and Pūṣan  is an especial preoccupation of the Bharadvāja poets, with VI.53–60 containing the  only sustained cycle of hymns in the R̥gveda addressed to this minor deity. Other  gods, well represented in other maṇḍalas, receive relatively short shrift: there is only  a single hymn to the Maruts (66), two to Uṣas (64–65), and so on.
