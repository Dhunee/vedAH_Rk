When they start contending over you two but violate the dear
ordinances ordained by you, Mitra and Varuṇa,
they, not attending upon the sacrifice, are neither gods, despite their
vaunting, nor mortals, but like children who do not swell [=grow/thrive]. 10. When the praisers distribute their speech and some recite the formal  invocations, paying them heed,
after that we will speak to you pronouncements that come true: “No  one (will violate your ordinances). You set in their places (the
peoples) along with the gods by your greatness.”
