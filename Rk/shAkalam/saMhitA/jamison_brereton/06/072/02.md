Indra and Soma, you make the dawn shine; you lead the sun upward  with its light.
You propped up the heaven with a prop; you spread out Mother Earth. 3. Indra and Soma, you smash the serpent surrounding the waters—Vr̥tra.  Heaven gave consent to you.
You roused forth the floods of the rivers; you filled the many (floods) of  the sea.
