These singers here with their chants chant to you, o you of many  talents, receiving the first of the sacrifice.
Listen to the call of him who calls you here as you are called. Immortal  one, there exists no one like you, other than you. 11. Now drive here, right up to my speech, since you know, o son of  strength, together with all those worthy of the sacrifice,
who had Agni as their tongue and served the truth, who put Manu very  close to Dasa.
