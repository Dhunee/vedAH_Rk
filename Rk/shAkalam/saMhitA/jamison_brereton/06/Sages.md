The VIth Maṇḍala, attributed to the Bharadvāja clan, contains seventy-five hymns.  The Anukramaṇī identifies the majority of the hymns as products of the eponymous clan poet himself, Bharadvāja, whose patronymic is Bārhaspatya. These  include all of the Agni series (1–16), much of the Indra series (17–30 and 37–43),  the Pūṣan series (53–60), and the miscellaneous hymns to various divinities toward  the end of the maṇḍala (61–74). 

The composite hymns coming at the end of the  Indra series (44–46, also 48) are ascribed to a different Bārhaspatya poet, Śaṃyu  Bārhaspatya, but since Śaṃyu is a speaking name (“seeking luck,” reinterpreted  from the archaic compound śaṃyóḥ “luck and lifetime”), this name may well be a  nickname of Bharadvāja. 

The remaining hymns are attributed to several different  descendants of Bharadvāja, all bearing the patronymic Bhāradvāja; these include a  number of Indra hymns (31–36, 47), the All God series (49–52), and the final hymn  of the maṇḍala, the famous weapon hymn (75).+++(5)+++
