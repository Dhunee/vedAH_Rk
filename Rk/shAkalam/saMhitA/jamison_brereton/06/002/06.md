Your smoke, when it is in heaven, is turbulent in motion, stretched out  (there) gleaming,
for you shine with your body, o pure one, like the sun with its brilliance. 7. For now you are to be reverently invoked among the clans, as our  dear guest,
to be protected like a son who brings delight to the home, (but also) to  be enflamed like a battle-lusty (warrior) in a stronghold.
