Indra and Agni, since gallant men are drawing their bows in their arms, do not shun us in this (contest) for great stakes, in our quests for cattle. 8. Indra and Agni, the evil hostilities of the stranger scorch me.
Make hatreds stay far away from here; keep (him) away from the sun. 9. Indra and Agni, in you are heavenly and earthly goods.
Extend to us here wealth that brings lifelong prosperity.
