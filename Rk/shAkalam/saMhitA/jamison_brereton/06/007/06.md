By the eye of Vaiśvānara have the backs of heaven been measured out,  by the beacon of the immortal one.
On his head alone are all the creatures; like twigs have his seven
outgrowths [?] grown. 7. He, the very resolute one, who measured out the dusky spaces,
(measured) out the luminous realms of heaven—the sage poet
Vaiśvānara—
who extends himself around all creatures, he is the undeceivable
herdsman, the protector of the immortal.
