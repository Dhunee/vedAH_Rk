To him who receives the first portion, the glorious conferrer of vigor, the  skillful god with lovely palms and lovely hands
who deserves the sacrifice of the dwelling places—to Tvaṣṭar easy to  invoke will far-radiant Agni, the Hotar, sacrifice. 10. The father of creation: with these hymns strengthen Rudra by day,  Rudra by night;
the lofty, high, ageless, very gracious one would we invoke separately,  roused by the poet.
