Reverence is powerful. I seek to attract reverence here. Reverence  upholds heaven and earth.
Reverence to the gods; reverence is master of them. With reverence
I seek to redeem even an offense committed. 9. You charioteers of truth who possess refined skill, settled in the  dwelling places of truth, undeceivable,
all you great superior men of broad gaze do I bend here with
reverences, o you who deserve the sacrifice.
