Great is Indraâ€”manful, filling the domains and doubly lofty,
undiminishing in his powers.
Inclined toward us, he has been strengthened for his heroic deed. Wide  and broad, he was well made by his makers. 2. The Holy Place positioned just Indra for winning, him lofty and  towering, unaging and youthful,
swollen with invincible strength, who in just a single day grew strong  and not by halves.
