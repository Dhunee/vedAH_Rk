Like a mortal he [=the dog] has shown preference for the speech of the  stalk being pressed.
Smite away the dog, the ungenerous one, as the BhrÌ¥gus (did) the Battler. 14. Their kinsman has wrapped himself in a cloak (of milk) to enjoy it, like  a son in the two arms (of his mother).
He runs like a swain to a maiden, like a wooer, to sit in the womb. 15. He is a hero, bringing skill to realization, who has propped apart the  two world-halves.
The tawny one has wrapped himself in the filter, like a ritual adept, to  sit in the womb.
