Through the inspired ones the primordial poet purifies himself; guided  by men he has roared around the casks.
Engendering the name of Trita, he flows as honey, to create the
partnership of Indra and Vāyu. 21. This one here, being purified, has made the dawns shine widely; this one  has become the maker of wide space for the rivers.
This one, having milked thrice seven (cows) for his own milk-mixture— the exhilarating Soma purifies himself in a way dear to the heart.
