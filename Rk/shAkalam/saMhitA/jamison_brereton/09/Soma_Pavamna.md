The IXth Maṇḍala is the only major grouping in the R̥gveda devoted to a single ritual  procedure. It consists of 114 hymns dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, “self-purifying  Soma.” It treats the deified ritual substance, the exhilarating drink soma, whose  preparation and offering are the focus of the most important Vedic ritual, the soma  sacrifice, but it treats that substance at only a single episode in the whole elaborate  sacrifice, the time when the soma juice, which has already been pressed, is poured  across the sheep’s fleece that serves to “purify” it—that is, to remove the vegetable  detritus still present in the liquid—before it is first diluted with water, then mixed  with milk, and poured into the offering vessels. (For more detailed treatment of  the ritual procedures involved see, e.g., Geldner’s introduction to this maṇḍala and  Oberlies 1999.)

There are no other hymns to Soma Pavamāna in the R̥gveda and only a few  to Soma in his other aspects (I.91, VIII.48, VIII.79, X.25, as well as a few dedi cated to Soma and another god [e.g., Soma and Rudra I.43, Agni and Soma  I.93]). Judging from this absence, as well as from the data provided by the poets  named by the Anukramaṇī, it is clear that many of the hymns in the maṇḍala  were extracted from the original bardic collections and assembled in this liturgically oriented collection, while other hymns in the maṇḍala were composed by  younger poets. The beginnings of the construction of a pan-Ārya sacrificial system, superseding the separate and competing clan rites—a construction that led  to the middle Vedic śrauta ritual system—can be discerned in various composite  hymns, especially IX.67.
