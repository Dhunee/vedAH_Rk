Purify yourself as best winner of prizes in the filter, pressed in a stream, most honeyed for Indra and Viṣṇu, for the gods, Soma. 7. The mothers, those without deceit, lick you, the tawny one, in the filter, as milk-cows do a new-born calf, o self-purifying one, at your expansion. 8. O self-purifying one, you drive to great fame with your brilliant rays. Vaunting yourself, you keep smashing away all the dark shades in the  house of the pious man.
