The (soma) plant, the prop and buttress of heaven, which, when well  extended and fully filled, encompasses in every direction,
that (plant) will offer sacrifice to these two great world-halves when they  turn hither. The poet unites the united pair and the refreshing drinks. 3. A great delight is the well-prepared somian honey, and wide is the  pasture-land of Aditi for him who goes to truth,
who, as a dawn-red bull, is master of the rain from here, who is the
leader of the waters, ageless and worthy of verses.
