Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
A satisfyingly tight structure knits together this little hymn. The first and last verses  contain the epithet “boundless” (vícarṣaṇi) providing a faint ring. More salient is  the chaining from verse to verse: a significant portion of the final pāda of one verse  opens the next verse.
The hymn also has extra-hymnic structural echoes: its final pāda is identical to  the final pāda of the first verse of the preceding hymn (IX.59.1), ascribed to the  same poet, save for “semen” in place of “treasure.”
## 01
Sing forth with a song to the boundless self-purifying one,
the drop with a thousand eyes.
## 02
You, possessing a thousand eyes and bringing a thousand presents, they have purified across the fleece.
## 03
Across the fleeces the self-purifying one has streamed. He runs into the tubs, entering the heart of Indra.
## 04
For the generosity of Indra, purify yourself as luck, o boundless Soma. Bring here semen providing offspring.
