title = "Metrical organization"

+++
The maṇḍala is organized by meter, with the majority of the hymns in the  dimeter gāyatrī meter (IX.1–67), followed by smaller collections of trimeter— jagatī (68–86) and triṣṭubh (87–97)—then anuṣṭubh (98–101), uṣṇih (102–106),  pragātha structures (107–108), ending with miscellaneous meters (109–114).  Within each metrical group the hymns are arranged by length, from longest to  shortest. Although the gāyatrī, jagatī, and triṣṭubh collections end with some  very long hymns, these “hymns” can easily be deconstructed into smaller hymns  containing the correct number of verses. For example, the jagatī group ends  with two apparently nonconforming hymns. After a long series of five-verse  hymns (IX.75–84) we find IX.85 at twelve verses and IX.86 at forty-eight. But  IX.85 can be broken down into three four-verse hymns and IX.86 into sixteen  tr̥cas (three-verse groupings). The longest hymn in the R̥gveda is the final hymn  of the triṣṭubh group, IX.97 with fifty-eight verses, divisible into tr̥cas (with a  final, extra verse).
