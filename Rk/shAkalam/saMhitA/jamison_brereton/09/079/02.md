across the crookedness of any mortal. May we always bear away the stakes. 3. Now, in the case of the hostility of one of our own, (we proclaim:) “he,  indeed, is a stranger!” And, in the case of the hostility belonging to
the other (side), (we proclaim:) “he, indeed, is a wolf!”
As if in a desert, thirst should strike them. O self-purifying Soma, smite  those of evil intent.
