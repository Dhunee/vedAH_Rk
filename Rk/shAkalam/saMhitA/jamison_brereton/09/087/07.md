This Soma being pressed, the steed like a surge sent surging, has run  around in the filter,
whetting his sharp horns like a buffalo, on a cow-hunt toward cows, like  a champion warrior. 8. This one traveled from within the highest stone [=mountain]; she found  the cows that were somewhere in the enclosure.
Like lightning from heaven thundering with the clouds, the stream of  soma purifies itself for you, Indra.
