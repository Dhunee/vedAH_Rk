These soma juices have surged across the sheep’s fleeces—they are like  the heavenly buckets that hold the rain from clouds—
toward the tubs at will when pressed, like rivers downward to the sea. 7. Tempestuous like the troop of Maruts, purify yourself, impervious to  calumny like that heavenly clan.
Quickly become benevolence for us, having a thousand ripples like the  waters, like a sacrifice that conquers in battles.
