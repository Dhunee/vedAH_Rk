Having the mind of a seer, a maker of seers, gaining the sun, having a  thousand devices, trail-blazer for poets,
a buffalo, seeking to gain the third domain, Soma, as rhythm
[/the anuṣṭubh meter], regulates the virāj (meter) according to rule. 19. Sitting in the cups, the falcon, the bird spreading (his wings), the  cow-finding drop, bearing weapons,
accompanying the wave of the waters, the buffalo declares the sea to be  the fourth domain.
