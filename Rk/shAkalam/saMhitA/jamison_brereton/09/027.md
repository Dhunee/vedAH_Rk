Soma Pavamāna
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Though attributed to a different poet and a different poetic lineage, this hymn,  like the last one (IX.26), is unified by a repeated initial pronoun in every verse, in  this case “this one, he” (eṣá) referring to Soma. Again, the content is conventional,  though there is emphasis on Soma’s victories and acquisitions (vss. 1, 2, 3, 4) and  his successful competition with the sun (vss. 2, 5). The cosmic aspect of Soma is  thus raised but not insisted upon.
## 01
This one, the much-praised poet, spills over into the filter,
striking away failures, while being purified.
## 02
This one, winning the sun, is poured all around for Indra and Vāyu in the filter, the one who brings skill to realization.
## 03
This one is led through (the filter) by men—the head of heaven, the bull,  the pressed
soma in the wooden (vessels), acquiring [/knowing] all.
1260 IX.28–29
## 04
This one, purifying himself, has roared, seeking cows, seeking gold— the drop, winning completely, not to be laid low.
## 05
This one races with the sun while purifying himself in heaven—
in the filter he is the exhilarating drink of exhilaration.
## 06
This one, the tempestuous tawny bull, has flowed in the midspace,
toward Indra—the drop as it is becoming purified.
