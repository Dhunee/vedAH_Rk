Whoever has paid tribute to the horse Dadhikrāvan when the fire has  been kindled at the break of dawn,
him let Aditi make without offense, in concert with Mitra and Varuṇa. 4. Once we (have paid tribute to) the refreshment and the great
nourishment of Dadhikrāvan, and have brought to mind the
auspicious name of the Maruts,
we call upon Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, and mace-armed Indra for well-being. 5. Both (sides) vie in invoking (him) just like Indra, as they rouse
themselves and reverently approach the sacrifice.
Dadhikrā, who makes sweetness for the mortal, have you, o Mitra and  Varuṇa, given to us as our horse.
