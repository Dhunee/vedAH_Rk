Produced without horse and rein, the praiseworthy chariot with its three  wheels rolls through the airy space.
This is the great proclamation of your divinity: that you prosper heaven  and earth, o R̥bhus. 2. The very perceptive ones who made from mind by insight the
smooth-running chariot, which never overturns—
(to you,) o Vājas, o R̥bhus, we now dedicate (the soma) of this pressing  for you to drink.
