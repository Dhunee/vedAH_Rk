When, at the separation of the grain [=spreading of the ritual grass?], at  the same udder [=the sacrifice?], on the domain of truth [=the ritual  ground?], the gods take pleasure,
great Agni, on whom the oblation is bestowed with reverence, the  truthful one, is always pursuing (his missions) for the ceremony. 8. You, as the knowing one, pursue your missions for the ceremony  between the two world-halves, observing them both together.
You speed as the messenger chosen from of old, since you know better  the means of ascending to heaven.
