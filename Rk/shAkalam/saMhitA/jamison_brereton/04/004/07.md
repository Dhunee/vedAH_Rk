Agni, let just him be rich in portions, rich in gifts, who with regular  oblation, who with solemn words
seeks to please you during his own lifetime, in his own dwelling. All  (days) (will be) day-bright for him. This desire (of his) will come true. 8. I recite a good thought to you [/recite (=praise) your good will]. Hear  it, inclined our way. (Like) a “Favorite” wife, let this song bring  harmony to you.
We who have good horses and good chariots would groom you. In us  you should uphold lordly powers through the days.
