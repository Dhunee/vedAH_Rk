These—sleepless, (ever) advancing, very friendly, tireless, never  wearying, keeping the wolf away—
these protectors of yours, directed to a single goal—let them settle  down and protect us, o ungullible Agni. 13. Agni, your protectors who, watching, guarded blind Māmateya  [=Dīrghatamas] from ill-faring,
those of good (ritual) action has the possessor [/knower] of everything  [=Agni] guarded. Though wishing to damage, the cheats did no
damage at all.
