Whoever will kindle you, Agni, with his offering ladle extended, whoever  will make food for you three times in the same day,
let him, victorious, be superior in heavenly brilliance in accordance with  your purpose, o Jātavedas—he the observant one. 2. Whoever will labor to bring fuel to you, rendering service to the face of  the great one, o Agni,
he, kindling (you) every evening, every dawn, follows along, thriving in  his wealth, smashing his foes.
