How might we, in concert, do service to Vaiśvānara, to Agni who gives  rewards; how might we serve his lofty light?
With his unfailing lofty growth he propped (heaven) like a post a bulwark. 2. Do not spurn (him), the self-empowered god who gave this bounty to me,  a mortal,
a simple man—he shrewd, discriminating, the immortal Vaiśvānara,  most manly, youthfully exuberant Agni.
