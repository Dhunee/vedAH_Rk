May my hymnic vision, purifying through its conception, reach just to him  [=Agni?] now, to the same one in the same way (as always [at the ritual]). On the hide of the grain [=ritual grass?] is the lovely (udder/name)
of Pr̥śni [=sacrifice]; on the tip of the mount has (the mystical
expression? the milk?) “jabāru” (also? been) mounted. 8. What (part) of this speech is to be proclaimed to me? They confide  privately what was deposited in secret [=the track/word]—
that they have uncovered it like the “water” of the ruddy (cows). He  [=Agni] protects the dear tip of the mount, the track of the bird.
