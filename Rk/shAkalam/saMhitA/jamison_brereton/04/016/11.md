Seeking help, you drive with Kutsa on the same chariot—you, the  goader of the Wind, the master of the two fallow bays,
seeking to hold onto the two silvery (horses of the Wind) like a prize  to be secured, so that on that day the poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] will exert  himself for decisive (help). 12. For Kutsa you laid low insatiable Śuṣṇa, who brings bad harvest, with  his thousands, before the day’s first meal.
Immediately crush out the Dasyus with (the weapon) that is Kutsa, and  then tear off the wheel of the Sun at the moment of encounter.
