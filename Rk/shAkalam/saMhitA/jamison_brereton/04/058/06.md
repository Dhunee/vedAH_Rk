These nourishing liquids flow together like streams, being purified  within by heart and mind.
These waves of ghee rush, like wild beasts retreating from a javelin. 7. As if on the straightaway of a river, they fly—the youthfully exuberant  ones, swift-battering, confounding the wind—
the streams of ghee—like a ruddy prizewinning horse splitting
the wooden race-course barriers [/splintering the sticks (in their  current)], swelling with their waves.
