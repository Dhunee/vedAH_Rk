For us clear away paths (to enable us) to sacrifice, o Vājas, o R̥bhukṣans, in order (for us) to cross all regions, since you are praised, o patrons. 8. (Cut up) that wealth for us, o Vājas, R̥bhukṣans, Indra, and Nāsatyas, (which is the sacrificial) horse from the border lands. Cut it up
abundantly to give (us) bounties.
