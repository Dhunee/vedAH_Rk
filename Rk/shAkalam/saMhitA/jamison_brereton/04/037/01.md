Travel toward our rite, o Vājas, o R̥bhukṣans, you gods, along the paths  the gods travel,
just as you established the sacrifice for yourselves among these clans of  Manu on a clear day of days, o you who bring joy. 2. Let the sacrifices be (pleasing) to your heart and mind: pleasing, they go  today clothed in ghee.
The full pressings will give you joy, and when drunk, they will inspire  you to determination and skill.
