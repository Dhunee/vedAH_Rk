You brought the son of the unwed girl, as he was being eaten by female  ants, out from their lair, o master of the fallow bays.
The blind man saw after taking the serpent. The man broken in the
“pot” [=hip?] set out; his joints fit together. 10. Knowing them, I speak forth your ancient deeds, o inspired one, to  (you) who know the deeds,
in just the way that you accomplished them, o king—the bullish and  manly labors welcomed for themselves.
