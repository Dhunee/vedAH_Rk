Then while we [=sacrificing priests] have acted, with feet, with hands,  with bodies, in serving you, Agni,
like those making a chariot with the work of (our/their) two arms, those  of good insight [=poets] have held fast to the truth, panting over it. 15. Then as the seven inspired poets might we be born from mother Dawn,  as the foremost ritual adepts for men.
