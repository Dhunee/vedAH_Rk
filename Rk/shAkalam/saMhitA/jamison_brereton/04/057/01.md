By means of the Lord of the Field as if by a concluded (alliance),  may we win
what prospers the cow, the horse. He will be gracious to one such as us. 2. O Lord of the Field, as a milk-cow yields milk, milk out upon us a  honeyed wave,
dripping with honey, well-purified like ghee. Let the lords of truth be  gracious to us. 3. Honeyed the plants, the heavens, the watersâ€”honeyed let the midspace  be for us.
Let the Lord of the Field be honeyed for us. Without suffering harm  may we follow after him.
