Indra smashed and Agni burned the Dasyus before midday at the  moment of confrontation, o drop.
With his missile he laid low many thousands of them, who were
travelling to the house of no exit [=grave] as if by their own intention. 4. O Indra, you made the Dasyus the lowest of all and the DƒÅsa clans  deprived of laud.
You two oppressed and crushed down your rivals and found requital  with your deadly weapons.
