Dawn
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: gāyatrī
A simple hymn in contrast to the immediately preceding dawn hymn, with Dawn  depicted and addressed only in the singular. The Aśvin pair is named in verses 2–3  because of their early-morning journey to the sacrifice.
## 01
This spirited lady, dawning forth from her sister [=Night],
has appeared opposite—the daughter of Heaven.
## 02
Dappled bright and ruddy like a mare, the mother of cows, follower of truth, Dawn has become the companion of the Aśvins.
## 03
You are both the companion of the Aśvins, and you are also mother  of cows,
and also, Dawn, you have dominion over goods.
## 04
With awareness of you, in response to you, who keep away hatred,  o liberal-spirited one,
we have awakened with praises.
## 05
Her auspicious rays have appeared opposite, like gushes of cows.
Dawn has filled up the wide expanse.
## 06
Having filled it up, wide-radiant one, you have uncovered the darkness  with your light.
O Dawn, help (us) according to your independent power.
## 07
Through heaven do you stretch with your rays, through the midspace  wide and dear,
o Dawn, with your bright brilliance.
