These Maruts here spur on even the feeble, likewise also the whirlwind,  in whatever way the good ones please.
Thrust aside the dark shades, o bulls. Confer all life and lineage on us. 21. Let us not miss out on your gift, o Maruts; let us not lag behind at the  distribution, o charioteers.
Give us a share in the goods we crave, whatever you have of good  quality, o bulls.
