Enjoy a blazing praise, newborn today, o Indra and Agni, smiters of  VrÌ¥tra,
for I keep calling upon you both, good to call, the two who best set out  the prize right away for him who wants it. 2. For you two, o swelling ones, grown in an instant, swollen in expanse,  become winners.
Holding sway over wealth, over abundant pasturage, give your fill of a  prize, substantial but thrilling.
