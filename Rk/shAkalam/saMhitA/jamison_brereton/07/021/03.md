You, Indra, have made the waters flow, the many waters hemmed around  by the serpent, o hero.
The nourishing streams have twisted away from you like charioteers  (maneuvering). All the finely made (fortifications) tremble with fear. 4. Fearsome, with their [=pressing stonesâ€™] weapons [=soma drinks] he  toiled at all manly labors, the knowing one.
Indra, bristling with excitement, shook apart the fortifications. With  mace in hand, he smashed them apart with his greatness.
