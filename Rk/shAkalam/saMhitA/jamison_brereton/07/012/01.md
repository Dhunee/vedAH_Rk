We have come with great reverence to the youngest one, who, kindled,  shines in his own home—
to him of shimmering radiance between the two wide world-halves, to  him facing out in every direction, receiving the well-poured offering. 2. Overcoming all difficulties by his greatness, Agni is praised in the  household as Jātavedas.
He will guard us from difficulty and reproach, (guard) both us, who are  singing, and our generous patrons.
