[Indra:] They, bright-faced, with their braids on the right side, quickening  thought—because they exhilarated me,
I, standing up from the ritual grass, speak about the superior
men: “They cannot be helped by me from a distance—the Vasiṣṭhas.” 2. From a distance they led Indra here with pressed (soma)—across a lake’s  worth (of soma), on beyond the powerful drink.
Over the pressed soma of Pāśadyumna Vāyata he preferred the Vasiṣṭhas. 3. It was certainly just with them that he crossed the Sindhu; certainly just  with them that he smashed Bheda [/the “Splitter”];
it was certainly just by reason of your sacred formulation that Indra  helped Sudās in the Battle of the Ten Kings, o Vasiṣṭhas.
