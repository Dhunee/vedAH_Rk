title = "Frog hymn"

Another quite remarkable  hymn, although in a very different vein, is VII.103, the Frog Hymn, in which the  poet compares the action and croaking of frogs to the ritual acts and recitations  of priests. The hymn was likely composed for the beginning of the rainy season  and with the purpose of spurring the fertility appropriate to the season. Equally  unusual and delightful is the sleep charm (VII.55).
