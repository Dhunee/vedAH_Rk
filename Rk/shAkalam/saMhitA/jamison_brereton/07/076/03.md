Those were the days: the many days through which, at the rising of  the sun,
you became visible, o Dawnâ€”faring forth thence toward the east-facing  (sacrifice), like (a maiden) faring forth to her lover, not like one going  (home) again. 4. Those were the feasting companions of the gods: the sage poets of old,  provided with truth.
The Fathers discovered the hidden light. With their mantras that come  true, they generated the Dawn.
