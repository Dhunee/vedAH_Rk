For you I shall urge on Agni like a prizewinning horse, the very god  acting with strength, by my homage:

“Become for us the knowing messenger of the rite!” Running with
measured pace, he has been found among the gods in his own person. 2. Journey here along your own paths, o Agni, as the delighting one who  takes pleasure in companionship with the gods;
(journey) here along the back of the earth, bellowing with outbursts,  burning everything, burning the wood at will with your jaws.
