When, o silvery son of Saramā, you bare your teeth, tawny one,
they glint like spears, in the jaws of (you) who are snapping. Go to sleep! 3. Bark at the thief, o son of Saramā, or at the robber, you who lunge (at  them) again and again.
You are barking at the praisers of Indra. Why do you torment us? Go  to sleep!
