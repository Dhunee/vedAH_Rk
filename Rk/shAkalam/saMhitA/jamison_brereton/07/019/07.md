(Being) within this enclosure of yours here, may we not be (available) to  be delivered to evil, o mighty possessor of the fallow bays.
Protect us with defenses that keep the wolf away. May we be your dear  ones, and dear to our patrons. 8. Dear indeed to you, o bounteous one, may we men rejoice in your  charge, in your protection, as your comrades.
Grind down Turvaśa, down Yādva, intending to do (a deed) worthy to  be proclaimed for Atithigva.
