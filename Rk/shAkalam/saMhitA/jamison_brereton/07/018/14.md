The cow-seeking Anu and Druhyu people fell down to sleep—sixty  hundred, six thousand (of them).
(But on the other side there were just) sixty heroes with six on top, in  search of (Indra’s) favor. All these are the manly deeds of Indra. 15. These Tr̥tsus, constantly laboring alongside Indra, ran like waters  released downward.
The ill-allied ones, meting (their supplies) out with a miser’s eye, (yet)  left behind all their goodies for Sudās.
