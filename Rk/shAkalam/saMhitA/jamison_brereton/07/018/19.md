The Yamunā (River) helped Indra, as did the Tr̥tsus. He despoiled  Bheda there entirely,
and the Ajas, Śighras, and the Yakṣus brought horses’s heads as tribute. 20. Neither your favors nor your riches, o Indra, can be entirely surveyed,  through the previous dawns, nor through the current ones.
You smote even the one who fancied himself a little god. You cut down  Śambara from the lofty (mountain) by yourself.
