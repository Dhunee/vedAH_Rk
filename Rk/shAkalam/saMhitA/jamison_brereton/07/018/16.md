The (mere) half a hero, who drinks the cooked oblation without Indra,  who vaunts himself, did he thrust away to the ground.
Indra confounded the battle fury of the one who confounds the battle  fury (of others). He took to the course of the path, being master of it. 17. Even with a feeble thing he performed this unique (deed): he smote even  the lioness with a wether.
Indra hewed down the poles with a pin. He handed over all the goodies  to SudƒÅs.
