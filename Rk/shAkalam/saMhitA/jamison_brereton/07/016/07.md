Agni, let our patrons be dear to you, who receive the well-poured  offering—
they, the generous guides of the peoples, who distribute pens of cattle. 8. Those in whose house Iḷā [/Libation] sits down, with her hands of ghee  and filled to the brim—
save them from deceit and blame, o powerful one. Hold out to us
far-famed protection.
