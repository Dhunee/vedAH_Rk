Our songs and thoughts, serving the gods, come to Agni, seeking a share  in wealth,
to him of lovely appearance, of lovely face, and of lovely look, to him  conveying oblations as the spoked wheel of the descendants of Manu. 4. O Agni, convey Indra to us along with the Vasus, lofty Rudra along with  the Rudras,
Aditi belonging to all peoples along with the Ādityas, and Br̥haspati  granting all wishes along with the reciters of verses.
