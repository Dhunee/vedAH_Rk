Maṇḍala VII also has a distinctive distribution of hymns. It includes nine  hymns dedicated, either wholly or in part, to the Ādityas or to Mitra and  Varuṇa, four hymns to Indra and Varuṇa, and four hymns to Varuṇa alone. The  significant role that the Ādityas and particularly Varuṇa play in VII perhaps  reflects a family connection to these gods, which also figures in the tradition  that Vasiṣṭha was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa. 

The personality of Vasiṣṭha is  defined most strongly in the four hymns to Varuṇa (VII.86–89). They describe  an intimate relationship between the poet and the god, in which the poet fears  the god’s displeasure but hopes for his mercy and his guidance, while recalling  their previous friendship.

The maṇḍala also contains the R̥gveda’s longest continuous series of hymns to  the Aśvins (67–74) and to Dawn (75–81), although the hymns of neither collec tion show the originality of the Varuṇa hymns. There are a number of noteworthy  individual hymns. 

## Battle of the Ten Kings
Among the most significant is VII.18, depicting the so-called Battle of the Ten Kings, which may reflect actual events, although with what accuracy it is hard to say. In distinctly triumphalist language, it tells how King Sudās  and the Bharatas were victorious over an alliance of ten kings ranged against him.  This battle may have been historically important if it marked the dominance of  the Bharatas over other Vedic tribes and significant movement toward a political  consolidation of the Vedic peoples. Closely connected with VII.18 is VII.33, attributed partly to Vasiṣṭha himself and partly to his sons. 

The hymn affirms the role of  Vasiṣṭha in securing Indra’s critical help in Sudās’s victory over the ten kings and  concludes with his sons’ story of the birth of Vasiṣṭha.
