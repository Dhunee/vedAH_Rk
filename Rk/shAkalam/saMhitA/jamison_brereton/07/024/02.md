Your doubly lofty mind has been captured, Indra; the soma has been  pressed, the honeyed (drinks) poured.
With the milk-streams released, the well-turned (hymn) is borne
(forth)â€”this inspired thought constantly invoking Indra. 3. Drive here to us from heaven, here from earth, you of the silvery drink,  to this ritual grass to drink the soma.
Let the fallow bays convey you, the powerful one, turned toward me, to  the song, to reach exhilaration.
