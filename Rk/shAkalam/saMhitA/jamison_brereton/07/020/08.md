The person dear to you who will perform ritual service for you, he will  be your comrade exclusively, o possessor of the stone.
Most pleasing to you, may we be in this benevolence of yours, in your  defense, in your protection for men, (so that) you will not smite (us). 9. This praise has bellowed (like) a bull to you, and (like) a thieving [?] (monkey?) has screeched, o bounteous one.
Desire for wealth has come over your singer. You alone, powerful one,  hold power over goods for us.
