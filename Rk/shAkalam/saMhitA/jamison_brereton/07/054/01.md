O Lord of the Dwelling Place, greet us. Become easy to enter and  without affliction for us.
When we entreat you, favor us in return: become weal for our
two-footed, weal for our four-footed. 2. O Lord of the Dwelling Place, be one who furthers us, fattening the  livestock with cows, with horses, o drop.
In your companionship might we be unaging. Like a father his sons,  favor us in return.
