In your single, joint trek, o energetic ones, your chariot encompasses the  seven flowing streams.
They do not become exhaustedâ€”these your surpassing (horses) of
powerful presence, which, yoked by the gods on their yoke-poles, carry  you two. 9. Be unfailing for the bounteous ones, who speed their gift of bounty  with wealth,
who extend their relationships by their liberal gifts, mingling their
bounties of cattle and of horses.
