I would turn you two here to our rite with oblations and reverence, o  kings Indra and Varuṇa.
The ghee-rich one [=the ladle/hymn] (goes) forth to you two, being
held (forth) in our arms. By itself it goes all around in its varying
appearance. 2. Heaven speeds the lofty rule of you two, who bind with ropeless bonds. Might the anger of Varuṇa avoid us. Indra will make a wide, wide world  for us.
