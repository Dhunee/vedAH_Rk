This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven,  
     What time thou sentest down life with a God's own power, freeing the floods.  
     All that is godless may he conquer with his might, and, Lord of Hundred Powers, find for us strength and food.
