As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the wind the vigorous currents,  
     The streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser bursting through the fences.  
8.Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling, they incline to Agni.  
     The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jatavedas joyfully receives them.
