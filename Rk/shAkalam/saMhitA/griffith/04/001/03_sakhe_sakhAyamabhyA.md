Do thou, O Friend, turn hither him who is our Friend, swift as a wheel, like two car-steeds in rapid course, Wondrous! to us in rapid course.  
     O Agni, find thou grace for us with Varuna, with Maruts who illumine all.  
     Bless us, thou Radiant One, for seed and progeny, yea, bless us, O thou Wondrous God.
