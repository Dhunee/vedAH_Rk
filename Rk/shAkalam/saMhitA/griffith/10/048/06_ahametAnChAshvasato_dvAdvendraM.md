These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray,  
     The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the God speaks to his worshippers.  
     This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me?  
     Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?
