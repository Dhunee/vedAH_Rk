You are like two pleasantly moving well-fed (hills) like Mitra and Varuna,  
     the two bestowers of felicity, veracious, possessors of infinite wealth, happy,  
     like two horses plump with fodder, abiding in the firmament,  
     like two rams (are you) to be nourished with sacrificial food, to be cherished (with oblations).
