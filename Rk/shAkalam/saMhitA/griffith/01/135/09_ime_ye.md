These Bulls of thine, O Vayu with the arm of strength, who swiftly fly within the current of thy stream, the Bulls increasing in their might,  
     Horseless, yet even through the waste swift-moving, whom no shout can stay,  
     Hard to be checked are they, like sunbeams, in their course. hard to be checked by both the hands.
