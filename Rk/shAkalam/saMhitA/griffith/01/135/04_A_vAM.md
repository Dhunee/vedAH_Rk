The chariot with its team of horses bring you both, to guard us and to taste the well-appointed food, Vayu, to taste the offerings!  
     Drink of the pleasant-flavoured juice: the first draught is assigned to you.  
     O Vayu, with your splendid bounty come ye both, Indra, with bounty come ye both.
