Thou art our own, O Indra, with victorious wealth: let might accompany thee, the Strong, to give us aid, like Mitra, to give mighty aid.  
     O strongest saviour, helper thou, Immortal! of each warrior's car.  
     Hurt thou another and not us, O Thunder-armed, one who would hurt, O Thunder-armed!
