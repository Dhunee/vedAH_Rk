THE car which Indra, thou, for service of the Gods though it be far away, O swift One, bringest near, which, Blameless One, thou bringest near,  
     Place swiftly nigh us for our help: be it thy will that it be strong.  
     Blameless and active, hear this speech of orderers, this speech of us like orderers.
