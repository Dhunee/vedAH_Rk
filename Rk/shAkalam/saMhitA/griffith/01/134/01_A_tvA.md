Vayu, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.  
     May our glad hymn, discerning well, uplifted, gratify thy mind.  
     Come with thy team-drawn car, O Vayu, to the gift, come to the sacrificer's gift.
