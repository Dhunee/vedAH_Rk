Two red steeds Vayu yokes, Vayu two purple steeds, swift-footed, to the chariot, to the pole to draw, most able, at the pole, to draw.  
     Wake up intelligence, as when a lover wakes his sleeping love.  
     Illumine heaven and earth, make thou the Dawns to shine, for glory make the Dawns to shine.
