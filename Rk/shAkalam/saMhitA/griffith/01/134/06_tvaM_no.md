Thou, Vayu, who hast none before thee, first of all hast right to drink these offerings of Soma juice, hast right to drink the juice out-poured,  
     Yea, poured by all invoking tribes who free themselves from taint of sin,  
     For thee all cows are milked to yield the Soma-milk, to yield the butter and the milk.
