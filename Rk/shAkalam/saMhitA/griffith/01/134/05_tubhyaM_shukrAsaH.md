For thee the pure bright quickly-flowing Soma-drops, strong in their heightening power, hasten to mix themselves, hasten to the water to be mixed.  
     To thee the weary coward prays for luck that he may speed away.  
     Thou by thy law protectest us from every world, yea, from the world of highest Gods.
