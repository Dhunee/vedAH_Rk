O Indra, drink the Soma juice pressed out with stones. poured from the reservoir, as an ox drinks the spring, a very thirsty bull the spring.  
     For the sweet draught that gladdens thee, for mightiest freshening of thy strength.  
     Let thy Bay Horses bring thee hither as the Sun, as every day they bring the Sun.
