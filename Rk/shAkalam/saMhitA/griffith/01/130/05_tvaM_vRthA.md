Thou, Indra, without effort hast let loose the floods to run their free course down,  
     like chariots, to the sea, like chariots showing forth their strength.  
     They, reaching hence away, have joined their strength for one eternal end,  
     Even as the cows who poured forth every thing for man, Yea, poured forth all things for mankind.
