Grasping his thunderbolt with both hands, Indra made its edge most keen, for hurling, like a carving-knife for Ahi's slaughter made it keen.  
     Endued with majesty and strength, O Indra, and with lordly might,  
     Thou crashest down the trees, as when a craftsman fells, crashest them down as with an axe.
