When with wise plan the Hero leads the people forth, they conquer in the ordered battle, seeking fame, press, eager, onward seeking fame.  
     To him in time of need they sing for life with offspring and with strength.  
     Their hymns with Indra find a welcome place of rest: the hymns go forward to the Gods.
