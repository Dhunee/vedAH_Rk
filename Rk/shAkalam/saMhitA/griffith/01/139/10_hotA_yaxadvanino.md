Let the Invoker bless: let offerers bring choice gifts; Brhaspati the Friend doth sacrifice with Steers, Steers that have many an excellence.  
     Now with our ears we catch the sound of the press-stone that rings afar.  
     The very Strong hath gained the waters by himself, the strong gained many a resting-place.
