Asvins, the pious call you with their hymns of praise, sounding their loud song forth to you, these living men, to their oblations, living men.  
     All glories and all nourishment, Lords of all wealth! depend on you.  
     The fellies of your golden chariot scatter drops, Mighty Ones! of your golden car.
