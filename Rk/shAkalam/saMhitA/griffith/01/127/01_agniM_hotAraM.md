AGNI I hold as herald, the munificent, the gracious, Son of Strength, who knoweth all that live, as holy Singer, knowing all,  
     Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Gods,  
     He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.
