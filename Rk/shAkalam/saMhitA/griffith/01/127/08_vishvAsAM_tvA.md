Thee we invoke, the Lord of all our settled homes, common to all, the household's guardian, to enjoy, bearer of true hymns, to enjoy.  
     Thee we invoke, the guest of men, by whose mouth, even as a sire's,  
     All these Immortals come to gain their food of life, oblations come to Gods as food.
