We, sacrificing, call on thee best worshipper, the eldest of Angirases, Singer, with hymns, thee, brilliant One! with singers' hymns;  
     Thee, wandering round as 't were the sky, who art the invoking Priest of men,  
     Whom, Bull with hair of flame the people must observe, the people that he speed them on.
