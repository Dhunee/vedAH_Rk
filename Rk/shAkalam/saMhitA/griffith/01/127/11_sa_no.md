Agni, beheld by us in nearest neighbourhood, accordant with the Gods, bring us, with gracious love, great riches with thy gracious love.  
     Give us O Mightiest, what is great, to see and to enjoy the earth.  
     As one of awful power, stir up heroic might for those who praise thee, Bounteous Lord!
