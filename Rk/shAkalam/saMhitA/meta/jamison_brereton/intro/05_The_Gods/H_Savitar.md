title = "H Savitar"

+++
Sometimes linked to the Ādityas and especially to Bhaga is the god Savitar. He is  the god who “impels” or “compels” beings—and these can include mortals, gods, animals, and objects. He especially acts at the beginning of night, when he sends  beings to rest (cf. I.35.2, IV.53.3, VII.45.1). But he also commands the end of the  night and the beginning of the day, when he brings forth the sun (I.35.9) and impels  beings to action. Because he is associated with the night, he is also connected with  the generation of offspring, who would be conceived during the night.+++(4)+++ Savitar is  bright, with golden eyes, golden arms, and golden hands. He stretches out his arms  in a gesture of command (II.38.2). Falk (1988: 17–22) reasonably suggests that his  brilliance during the night and his outstretched arms point to the Milky Way as a  manifestation of Savitar.
