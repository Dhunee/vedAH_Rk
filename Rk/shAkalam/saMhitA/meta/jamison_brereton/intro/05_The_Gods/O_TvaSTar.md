The meaning of Tvaṣṭar’s name is fully transparent:  he is the “Fashioner,” who  “adorned all the creatures with their forms” (X.110.9) and who knows all living  things (IV.42.3). But his role is more complex than his name might imply. He is the  father of Indra (III.48.2–4, IV.18), whom Indra displaced and from whom Indra  stole the soma (III.48.4). On the other hand, Tvaṣṭar fashioned Indra’s distinctive weapon, the mace, for him (I.32.2, V.31.4, VI.17.10, X.48.3). Tvaṣṭar is also  sometimes called the father of Agni (III.7.4), and he is the god who has begotten  offspring (III.55.19; cf. III.4.9). His role as a father perhaps explains his close relationship with the Wives of the Gods (I.22.9, 161.4; II.1.5, 31.4, 36.3; VII.35.6), with  whom he is ritually joined.
