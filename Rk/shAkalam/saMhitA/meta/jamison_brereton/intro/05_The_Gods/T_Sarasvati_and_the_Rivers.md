title = "T Sarasvatī and the Rivers"

+++
Another divinity with a great future ahead but little prominence in our text is the  goddess Sarasvatī. Again the R̥gveda provides little or no evidence for her later role  as patron of learning and the arts, though a number of scholars have attempted  to find it. Instead she is celebrated, in the three hymns dedicated to her and in  other mentions in the text, simply as a physical river with a powerful flow, which is  sometimes destructive but which also provides fecundity with its fructifying waters.  Other rivers are also praised in the R̥gveda, especially the Sindhu in a hymn dedicated to the rivers in general.
