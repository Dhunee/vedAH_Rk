title = "S Rudra"

+++
Although Rudra, under his euphemistic epithet Śiva, “the kindly one,” has, of  course, an extraordinarily great future in classical Hinduism, in the R̥gveda he has  a very circumscribed role, with only three complete hymns dedicated to him. He  has two major and complementary characteristics:  on the one hand, he is fierce  and malevolent, with an often inexplicable anger that needs to be appeased; on  the other, he is a healer, who controls the remedies for disease. He is also, as noted  above, the father of the Maruts, who are much more prominent in our text.
