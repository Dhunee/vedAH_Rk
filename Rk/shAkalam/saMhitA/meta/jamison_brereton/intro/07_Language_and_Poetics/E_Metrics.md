The most conspicuous and ubiquitous formal feature of the R̥gveda is meter. The  hymns are composed in a variety of meters, but all of the meters are syllable-counting and quantitative. That is, they consist of lines containing a fixed number of syllables,  arranged in patterns of “heavy” and “light” syllables (the “quantity” referred to by  the term “quantitative”). Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes  e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not  belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron (¯).  Light syllables contain a short vowel followed by, at most, a single consonant and  are symbolized by a breve (˘). (Aspirated consonants [those written with two roman  letters, the second of which is h, e.g., th] count as single consonants.) The final syllable of a line is metrically indifferent and symbolized by x. The distinction between  heavy and light metrical syllables simply formally enshrines patterns inherent in  the language itself, where various linguistic processes are sensitive to distinction  in syllable weight and the difference between short and long vowels is lexically and  morphologically crucial.+++(5)+++ 

## IE comparisons
This type of metrical structure was inherited from the Indo-European poetic  tradition, most clearly evident in ancient Greek meter, especially the Aeolic meters  utilized by Sappho and Alcaeus, which are also syllable-counting and quantitative;  these Aeolic meters have long been considered cognate to Vedic meter.+++(4)+++ The meter  of the Old Avestan Gāthās is also closely akin: though the quantitative aspect has  been lost, Gāthic lines have a fixed number of syllables. 

## Comparison to classical sanskrit meters
R̥gvedic meter is also identical in its structural principles to most of the meters  encountered in Epic and Classical Sanskrit (with the exception of the ārya and  related types). The major difference between Vedic meter and Classical Sanskrit  meter has to do with the regulation of quantities. In the earlier parts of the line  R̥gvedic meter has relatively unfixed quantities; it is only toward the end of a line  (the cadence) that the quantity of each syllable is fixed (especially in trimeter meter,  on which see below).+++(5)+++ By contrast, most Classical Sanskrit literary meters regulate  the quantity of each syllable in the line; in other words, the relative flexibility of  R̥gvedic meter has become frozen. The exception is the eight-syllable epic anuṣṭubh,  or so-called “śloka” meter—the overwhelmingly predominant meter in the two  great epics and the workhorse meter of non-literary Classical Sanskrit verse texts  such as Manu’s lawcode—whose quantities are precisely fixed only in the second  half of each line. 

## Types
R̥gvedic meters are generally divided into “dimeter” and “trimeter” types. The  former consists of eight-syllable lines, which can be conveniently considered to consist of two equal segments, with the second half tending more toward fixed quantities, generally in an iambic pattern. However, it is important to keep in mind that  there is no fixed caesura (word-break) in dimeter meter, and even the four cadential  syllables are not rigidly fixed in quantity. 

Trimeter meter is more complex. It generally consists of lines of either eleven or twelve syllables (triṣṭubh or jagatī respectively), characterized not only by a fixed cadential sequence of four (triṣṭubh) or  five (jagatī) syllables but also by a strong caesura after the first four or five syllables  in the line.+++(5)+++ The caesura and the cadence thus effectively divide the line into three  parts—the opening (the first 4–5 syllables before the caesura), the “break” (the 2–3  syllables following the caesura), and the cadence.

## Examples
Examples of the three most common types of lines, dimeter, trimeter (triṣṭubh), and  trimeter (jagatī) follow, with heavy and light syllable scansion given below the text. We  have provided two examples each for the trimeter lines, one with four-syllable opening  and three-syllable break+++(=pattern after caesura)+++, one with five-syllable opening and two-syllable break. 

Dimeter  
eight-syllable dimeter  
I.1.1a agním īḻe puróhitam   
¯ ˘ ¯ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x  
Note the iambic rhythm of the last 4 syllables. 

Trimeter  
Trimeter cadences:  
triṣtubh:  ¯ ˘ ¯ x  
jagatī:  ¯ ˘ ¯ ˘ x  

Note that twelve-syllable jagatī can be seen as a one-syllable extension of triṣṭubh,  with an extra light syllable inserted right before the end, resulting in a five-syllable  cadence. The structure of the rest of the line is the same. 

### triṣṭubh - opening of 4
eleven-syllable trimeter: triṣṭubh — opening of four  
I.32.1a índrasya nú vīríyāṇi prá vocam  
¯ ¯ ˘ ˘ | ¯ ˘ ¯ ¯  ˘  ¯  x  
The obligatory caesura (word break) after the opening is marked by a slash; the  break is three syllables (¯ ˘ ¯) and is not followed by a caesura, while the cadence is  the proper triṣṭubh one (¯ ˘ ¯ x). 

### triṣṭubh - opening of 5
eleven-syllable trimeter: triṣṭubh—opening of five  
I.32.1b yā́ni cakā́ra prathamā́ni vajrī́  
¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ¯ | ˘ ˘ ¯  ˘  ¯  x   
Note that the rhythms of the openings of the two triṣṭubh lines are quite distinct.  Here the break is two syllables (˘ ˘), and the cadence the same as the previous line. 

### jagatī—opening of four
twelve-syllable trimeter: jagatī—opening of four  
II.1.16b ágne rātím upasr̥jánti sūráyaḥ  
¯ ¯ ¯ ˘ | ˘ ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x  
The opening is different from either of the triṣṭubh openings above; the break is  three shorts (˘ ˘ ˘), unlike the short/long/short (¯ ˘ ¯) three-syllable break of the  quoted triṣṭubh line. The cadence is the standard jagatī five-syllable one (¯ ˘ ¯ ˘ x). 

### jagatī—opening of five
twelve-syllable trimeter: jagatī—opening of five   
II.1.16c asmā́ñ ca tā́ṃś ca prá hí néṣi vásya ā́  
¯ ¯ ˘ ¯ ¯ | ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x  
Yet another opening pattern. The two-syllable (˘ ˘) break is identical to that of the  triṣṭubh with opening of five, as shorter breaks have fewer possible patterns. The  cadence is the standard jagatī cadence. Note that though there happens to be a word  break between the break and the cadence in this line, it is not an obligatory one, and in  fact none of the other three trimeter lines quoted shows a word break at this position. 

## pādas
The lines just described are called pādas, a term we will employ throughout  this work. A R̥gvedic verse (r̥c) consists of a group of pādas, generally three or  four, though meters with fewer than three pādas or more than four are also found.+++(4)+++  Lower-case roman letters are used to refer to the pādas in a verse (so, e.g., “5b” will  refer to the second pāda in the fifth verse of a hymn). Again, we will regularly use  this shorthand in identifying lines. 

There is another significant division within the  verse: the hemistich or half-verse. In four-pāda verses this consists of two two-pāda  units; in three-pāda verse, the first two pādas are considered the hemistich, with a  single pāda following. 

- The most common dimeter meter is gāyatrī, a collection of three eight-syllable  pādas. Approximately one quarter of the R̥gveda is composed in this meter.+++(4)+++ 
- The  other common dimeter meter is anuṣṭubh, which contains four such eight-syllable  lines and is the ancestor of the Epic and Classical śloka mentioned above. 
- The  most common trimeter meter, in fact the most common meter in the R̥gveda, is  triṣṭubh, which accounts for approximately 40% of the text.+++(5)+++ It consists of four  eleven-syllable pādas, while jagatī likewise consists of four pādas, though of twelve  syllables each. 
- Jagatī is the third most common meter, after triṣṭubh and gāyatrī. 
- Besides these mono-type meters, some hymns are composed in what are referred to  in general as “mixed-lyric meters,” whose verses consist of combinations of eight and twelve-syllable pādas.+++(5)+++ There are a number of different combinations, each with  a different name. (For details, see especially the table of meters in van Nooten and  Holland 1994, referred to below.) 

The details just given are not relevant only to professional metricians, for the  rhetoric and semantic structure of the R̥gveda are strongly driven and shaped by  meter. Syntactic constituents often occupy single pādas, for example, and metrical  boundaries (the beginning and end of the line, as well as the position immediately  after the caesura) are favored sites for positioning emphatic elements.+++(5)+++ 

## Hemistich
The hemistich  is a particularly salient unit, dividing the verse into syntactic and semantic halves.  In fact, we have discovered that it is almost always possible, and generally desirable,  to render the hemistich division in English—that is, to translate the first half and  the second half of the verse as separate units.+++(5)+++ This is reflected in the physical layout  of our translation, with the second hemistich starting a new line. It is remarkable  how faithful it is possible to be to the Sanskrit hemistichs without significantly com promising the English. (The hemistich division is less important and more often  syntactically breached in gāyatrī, since the division results in uneven parts:  two  pādas followed by one, but even in gāyatrī the third pāda is often independent of  the first two.+++(5)+++)

## Verse
The verse is the most significant unit in a R̥gvedic hymn—hence the name  R̥g-veda, or Veda of verses (r̥c). It is almost always a self-contained syntactic construction, and even when that construction is not entirely independent syntactically  (e.g., when it is a relative clause, dependent on a main clause in a verse following or  preceding), it will be internally unified. There are almost no examples of syntactic  enjambment between verses. This focus on the internal unity and syntactic independence of the verse is continued in later Sanskrit poetry, where it reaches its defining  limit in so-called muktaka verses or single-verse poems. 

## Strophes
Nonetheless, some hymns are structured into larger groupings of two to three  verses, which are sometimes referred to as “strophes.”+++(4)+++ 

The tr̥ca or “triplet” is the  most common such grouping, consisting of three verses, generally in gāyatrī,  though other meters are also found. Sometimes the tr̥ca unit is strongly defined by  shared lexicon or a shared refrain, or by parallel syntactic structures, or by a common theme; other tr̥cas have only the faintest signs of unity in rhetoric or content.  Quite long hymns can be built from these three-verse units, which are especially  common in Maṇḍala VIII and, as Oldenberg argued (1888: 119–40), were the special province of the Udgātar (singer) priest. Many of these strophes were borrowed  into the Sāmaveda, whose principal priest in classical śrauta ritual was the Udgātar  and one of whose major textual sources is R̥igveda VIII. 

The other major strophic  type is the pragātha, consisting of two verses in two different types of “mixed lyric”  meters. The usual combination is br̥hatī (8 8, 12 8)  and satobr̥hatī (12 8, 12 8).+++(5)+++  Again, pragāthas are especially common in the VIIIth Maṇḍala and frequently  taken over into the Sāmaveda. Thus the standard types of multi-verse groupings  tended to provide the lyric or sung portion of the ritual, as against the recited portions associated with the Hotar priest. 

## Conclusion
A brief and clear account of R̥gvedic meter is given in Macdonell (1916: appen dix II). For full details see Arnold (1905). Oldenberg’s Prolegomena (1888) is invaluable both for his detailed treatment of the meters of particular hymns and sets  of hymns and for his discussion of the historical implications of metrical details.  Van Nooten and Holland (1994) provide a hymn-by-hymn metrical commentary  in somewhat lapidary style, as well as a table of R̥gveda meters as identified in the  Anukramaṇī (pp. xiv–xvi), which should be consulted for the names and characteristics of meters not explicitly discussed here.
