RV commentary: introductory remarks and abbreviations

As a companion to the Jamison-Brereton English translation of the Ṛgveda (The
Rigveda: The Earliest Religious Poetry of India. An English Translation, Oxford UP,
2014), we two translators intend to provide a more detailed commentary on the
translation, intended for readers with Sanskrit who are interested in how, starting
from the text, we arrived at the translations we did, especially in the frequent cases in
which our translations diverge from the standard ones, esp. Geldner’s. For a project
of this sort, online posting seems the ideal medium. The commentary will be posted
piecemeal, and its various pieces will be updated from time to time. We anticipate
that producing a complete commentary will take some years. At this point only
Jamison will be posting commentary, primarily on hymns for which she had final
responsibility. (For the division by translator, see the published translation, pp. 83–
84.)


When citing from the comm., please give the date of access as well as the date of the
posting of the file, since updated versions of already posted files will be regularly
substituted, with the date of re-posting.

Comments will not only point out our differences from standard interpretations and
explain the reasons for them, but also touch on any matters of language or content
that strike us as worth discussion -- especially poetic and rhetorical figures, puns and
word plays, and curious or aberrant syntax and morphology. Our own doubts about
our translations of particular passages will also be noted, with possible alternative
translations provided, and comments and suggestions subsequently made by others
will be incorporated. Errors and omissions in the published translation will also be
rectified. Lists of emended or alternate translations and of typos in the published
edition are also provided.
We will not generally provide info. readily available elsewhere (e.g., parallels,
repeated passages, standard metrical resolutions, which are generally noted by
Geldner in the first two cases and Oldenberg in the last) except when it’s necessary
for our argument. Nor will we catalogue all our differences from all the standard
translators/interpreters, though we will usually do so for Ge. Nor engage with most
of the sec. lit. And we will try to repeat info. from our published translation only
when nec. to make the point clear. We thus expect that readers will have access at
least to our published tr. and Geldner, with Grassmann, Renou (ÉVP), Oldenberg
(Noten), and Witzel-Goto useful to have to hand as well. Many of the references to
other secondary literature will be made in an abbreviated style and will assume that
the interested reader can decode these references, although at some point we may
provide a more formal bibliography.

The commentary is, not surprisingly, ordered by hymn and verse number. Hapaxes
will be discussed in the passage in which they’re found, as will particular
morphological forms. Words that appear rarely and require lexical discussion will
generally be discussed only once (and not necessarily in the first passage in which
they are found). An index is provided for these.
