This translation exists because of Patrick Olivelle, who, some ﬁfteen years ago orso at the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society in New Orleans in 1998,approached the two of us with a proposition: that we should undertake a quicktranslation of the
R 
 ̥
gveda for a general audience. Patrick’s persuasive powers arewell known, and we were intrigued and easily persuaded. Although the “quick”element of the proposition was not exactly fulﬁlled, we wish to thank Patrick abun-dantly for starting us on this path, which has provided both of us with the mostsustained and satisfying intellectual experience of our lives, and for his constantencouragement and sage advice along the way.That we could undertake this project at all is entirely due to our shared guru,Stanley Insler, with whom we ﬁrst read
R 
 ̥
gveda in 1971. Stanley’s combination ofmeticulous philology with inventive interpretation and imaginative reading, neveraccepting conventional wisdom without scrutiny—however many millennia theconventional wisdom has held—has been a constant inspiration to us. And not onlyis our general approach to the text entirely informed by his teaching and example,but many of our interpretations of particular passages ﬁrst saw the light of day inhis classes.Over the years we have read
R 
 ̥
gveda with several generations of students, manyof whom are now colleagues and friends, and other colleagues have read portions ofour translation or discussed it with us, offering helpful and trenchant criticism andsupportive encouragement. We cannot name them all, but among the many we wishto mention especially Jim Benson, Wendy Doniger, Harry Falk, Ben Fortson, OliverFreiberger, Arlo Grifﬁths, Dieter Gunkel, Mark Hale, Hans Hock, Jan Houben,Joshua Katz, Jared Klein, Sasha Lubotsky, Jesse Lundquist, Craig Melchert, ChrisMinkowski, Marianne Oort, Asko Parpola, Ted Proferes, Hanns-Peter Schmidt,Gregory Schopen, Martha Selby, Hartmut Scharfe, Oktor Skjaervø, Rupert Snell,George Thompson, Elizabeth Tucker, Brent Vine, and Jarrod Whitaker.We wish to acknowledge also the ﬁnancial and institutional support that wehave received. The National Endowment for the Humanities supported this projectthrough a Collaborative Grant in 2005 that allowed us to work more frequentlytogether during a critical period in our work. Also, we wish to thank both theUniversity of Missouri, which provided Joel a leave to begin this project (during theacademic year 1999–2000), and the University of Texas at Austin, which gave himtime to continue it (in the fall 2004).

We would also like to thank Oxford University Press and especially CynthiaRead for her continuing support of the project and her patience in awaiting itscompletion, as well as Charlotte Steinhardt at the Press and Jashnie Jabson, ourProduction Editor at Newgen Knowledge Works, Chennai, for their help in prepar-ing the manuscript for publication. We want to extend special thanks to KatherineEirene Ulrich, our skillful, vigilant, meticulous, and, above all, tactful copy-editor,without whose care many slips and infelicities would have remained in the ﬁnishedversion.Finally, we wish each to give heartfelt thanks to the most signiﬁcant person inour individual lives. Joel to Ren
é
 Campos, whose patience was often tried duringthe long period that I worked on this translation. I appreciate his efforts to enliventhe parts of my life not given over to the
R 
 ̥
gveda and thereby to inform the partthat has been. Stephanie to my husband, Calvert Watkins, who lived daily with thisproject for all those years, read innumerable drafts of many of the translations,and whose astounding range of knowledge about Indo-European languages andtheir poetic traditions and his ﬁne-tuned sense of archaic poetry can be seen as thefoundation of every word of my translations. I deeply regret that he did not live tosee the translation in print.

 
## A NOTE ON THE TITLE
Although throughout this book we use the more scholarly transliteration of thename of the text,
R 
 ̥
gveda, we have chosen to use the old-fashioned renderingRigveda in the title of the book itself in order to avoid the problems that mightarise from having a diacritic in the ﬁrst letter of the title
