The year be our lord who gives breath to us; may days and nights produce long life. Svāhā!


[^5]:  I read, as Prof. Stenzler and the Petersburg Dictionary do, svārā kṣarāṇi. Comp. Pāraskara III, 3, 6.

'Peaceful be the earth, happy the air, may the goddess Heaven give us safety. Happy be the quarters (of the horizon), the intermediate quarters, the upper quarters; may the waters, the lightnings protect us from all sides. Svāhā!

'May the waters, the rays carry our prayers (to the gods); may the creator, may the ocean turn away evil; may the past and the future, (may) all be safe to me. Protected by Brahman may I pour forth songs. Svāhā!

'May all the Ādityas and the divine Vasus, the Rudras, the protectors, the Maruts sit down (here). May Prajāpati, the abounding one, the highest ruler, bestow vigour, offspring, immortality on me. Svāhā!

'Prajāpati, no other one than Thou (Rig-veda X, 121, 10).'
