[^1]:  6, 1. 'He should touch at the same time the right wheel with his right hand, the left wheel with his left hand.' Nārāyaṇa.

[^2]:  On the Vedic form of the chariot and of the wheels, comp. Zimmer, Altindisches Leben, p. 247.

[^3]:  According to Nārāyaṇa this Sūtra would refer only to other vehicles of wood, which he is directed to touch with that Ṛc when going to mount them. Perhaps the commentator is right; the wording of the Ṛc is well in keeping with his explanation.
