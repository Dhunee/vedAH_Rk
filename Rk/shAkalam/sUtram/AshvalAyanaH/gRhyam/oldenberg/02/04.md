[^1]:  4, 1. Comp. Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya III, 12 seqq. The four p. 206 months of Hemanta and Śiśira are Mārgaśīrṣa, Pauṣa, Māgha, and Phālguna.

[^2]:  The statement of the Prayogaratna that in case the sacrificer should celebrate only one Aṣṭakā festival, the Aṣṭakā of the Māgha month is to be selected, well agrees with the designation of this Aṣṭakā as 'the one Aṣṭakā' (ekāṣṭakā); see Weber, Naxatra II, 341 seq.; Indische Studien, XV, 145.

[^3]:  7 seqq. Comp. the nearly identical passage in Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya III, 14, 3 seqq. and the note there. Āśvalāyana evidently gives these rules not as regarding one special Aṣṭakā but all of them.
