10 [^7] . When they have come to a place where standing water is, having once (plunged into it and) emerged from it, they pour out one handful (of water), pronounce the Gotra name and the proper name (of the deceased), go out (of the water), put on other garments, wring out (the old garments) once, lay them away with their skirts to the north, and sit down until the stars appear.


[^7]:  'All the Samānodaka relations (see Manu V, 60), men and women, should pour out one handful of water each. Pronouncing p. 244 the Gotra name and the proper name of the deceased, saying, for instance, "Devadatta, belonging to the Gotra of the Kāśyapas, this water is for thee!" - they sprinkle it out, with southward-turned faces.' Nārāyaṇa.
