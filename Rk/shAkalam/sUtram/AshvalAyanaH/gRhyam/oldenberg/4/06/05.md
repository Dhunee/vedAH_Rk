5 [^3] . At the time of the Agni(-hotra) he should kindle fire with the hemistich, 'Here may this other Jātavedas' (Rig-veda X, 16, 9).


[^3]:  The text has agnivelāyām, which Nārāyaṇa explains by agnihotraviharaṇakāle aparāhne. He states that the fire should be produced by attrition of two new kindling woods (araṇi), mentioned in Sūtra 4. The fire thus kindled is to be used, he says, as a kitchen-fire. Herein he seems to me to have misunderstood the meaning of the ceremony; see the note on Sūtra 2. The hemistich quoted in this Sūtra (which is the second half of the same verse of which the first half is prescribed in Sūtra 2) clearly points to the sacred quality of the fire in question; it runs thus, 'Here may this other Jātavedas carry the offerings to the gods, the knowing one.'
