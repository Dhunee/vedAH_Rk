9 [^5] . Having (again) given water (to them),


[^5]:  Yājñavalkya I, 230. The reading of several words of the Mantra is doubtful, and the parallel texts, as Prof. Stenzler has not failed to observe, differ; especially the words pratnavadbhiḥ prattaḥ seem to me to be corrupt. The word pratnavat is only known to the Petersburg Dictionary as having the meaning, 'containing the word pratna,' which will not do here. Thus, I think that the reading pratnam adbhiḥ pṛktaḥ should be adopted; the translation would be, 'Anciently thou hast been mixed with water.'
