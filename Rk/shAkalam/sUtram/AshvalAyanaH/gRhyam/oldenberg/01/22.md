## 01
1. Having tied the girdle round him and given him the staff, he should impose the (observances of the) Brahmacarya on him

## 02
2. (With the words), 'A Brahmacārin thou art. Eat water. Do the service. Do not sleep in the day-time. Devoted to the teacher study the Veda.'

## 03
3. Twelve years lasts the Brahmacarya for (each) Veda, or until he has learnt it.

## 04
4. Let him beg (food) in the evening and in the morning.

## 05
5. Let him put fuel on (the fire) in the evening and in the morning.

## 06
6. Let him beg first of a man who will not refuse,

## 07
7. Or of a woman who will not refuse.

## 08
8. (In begging he should use the words), 'Sir, give food!'

## 09
9 [^1] . Or, '(Sir, give) Anupravacanīya (food).'

## 10
10 [^2] . That (which he has received) he should announce to his teacher.

## 11
11. He should stand the rest of the day.

## 12
12 [^3] . After sunset (the student) should cook the Brāhmaudana (or boiled rice with which the Brāhmaṇas are to be fed) for the Anupravacanīya sacrifice (the sacrifice to be performed after a part of the Veda has been studied), and should announce to the teacher (that it is ready).

## 13
13. The teacher should sacrifice, while the student takes hold of him, with the verse, 'The wonderful lord of the abode' (Rig-Veda I, 18, 6).

## 14
14. A second time with the Sāvitrī

## 15
15 [^4] . And whatever else has been studied afterwards.

## 16
16. A third time to the Ṛṣis.

## 17
17. A fourth time (the oblation) to (Agni) Sviṣṭakṛt.

## 18
18 [^5] . Having given food to the Brāhmaṇas he should cause them to pronounce the end of the Veda (study).

## 19
19. From that time (the student) should eat no saline food; he should observe chastity, and should sleep on the ground through three nights, or twelve nights, or one year.

## 20
20 [^6] . When he has fulfilled those observances, (the teacher) performs (for him) the 'production of intelligence,' (in the following way):

## 21
21 [^7] . While (the student) towards an unobjectionable direction (of the horizon) sprinkles thrice (water) from the left to the right with a water-pot round a Palāśa (tree) with one root, or round a Kuśa bunch, if there is no Palāśa, (the teacher) causes him to say, 'O glorious one, thou art glorious. As thou, O glorious one, art glorious, thus, O glorious one, lead me to glory. As thou art the preserver of the treasure of sacrifice for the gods, thus may I become the preserver of the treasure of the Veda for men.'

## 22
22 [^8] . Thereby, beginning with his having the hair cut, and ending with the giving in charge, the imposing of observances has been declared.

## 23
23. Thus for one who has not been initiated before.

## 24
24. Now as regards one who has been initiated before:

## 25
25 [^9] . The cutting of the hair is optional,

## 26
26 [^10] . And the 'production of intelligence.'

## 27
27 [^11] . On the giving in charge there are no express rules (in this case);

## 28
28 [^12] . And on the time.

## 29
29 [^13] . (He should recite to him) as the Sāvitrī (the Ṛc),'That we choose of god Savitṛ' (Rig-veda V, 82, 1).



[^1]:  22, 9. Food for the Anupravacanīya offering; see Sūtra 12.

[^2]:  Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya II, 6, 7; Pāraskara II, 5, 8.

[^3]:  'The student should, according to the rules for the Pākayajñas, cook the Anupravacanīya food and announce it to the teacher in the words, "The food is cooked."' Nārāyaṇa.

[^4]:  Nārāyaṇa mentions as such texts especially those belonging to the Āraṇyaka, viz. the Mahānāmnyas, the Mahāvrata, and the Upaniṣad. But there is no reason why we should not think quite as well of the Rig-veda Saṃhitā itself.

[^5]:  'He should say, "Sirs! Pronounce the end of the Veda (study)." And they should reply, "May an end of the Veda (study) be made."' Nārāyaṇa.

[^6]:  Comp. above, chap. 15, 2.

[^7]:  'The objectionable directions are three, the south, the southeast, the south-west.' Nārāyaṇa.

[^8]:  The rules stated above for the Upanayana, beginning with the prescription regarding the cutting of the hair (given chap. 19, so in the words, 'whose [hair on the] head is arranged;' see the note there), and ending with the ceremony prescribed chap. 20, 8, are to be extended also to other cases of the imposing of a vow, such, for instance, as that mentioned chap. 18, 9.

[^9]:  See chap. 79, 10.

[^10]:  See above, Sūtra 20.

[^11]:  See chap. 20, 8.

[^12]:  See chap. 4, 1.
