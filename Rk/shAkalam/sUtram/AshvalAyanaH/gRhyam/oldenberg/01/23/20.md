20 [^9] . The functions of an officiating priest are not to be exercised, if abandoned (by another priest), or at an Ahīna sacrifice with small sacrificial fee, or for a person that is sick, or suffering, or affected with consumption, or decried among the people in his village, or of despised extraction: for such persons (the functions of a Ritvij should not be exercised).


[^9]:  The tradition takes nīcadakṣiṇasya as in apposition to ahīnasya, and I have translated accordingly. But I cannot help thinking that the two words should be separated, so that we should have to translate, 'or at an Ahīna, or for a person that gives small sacrificial fee.' Thus the Brāhmaṇa quoted by Āpastamba (see the commentary on the Pañcaviṃśa Brāhmaṇa, vol. i, p. 6, ed. Bibl. Indica) gives the following questions which the Ritvij to be chosen should ask, 'Is it no Ahīna sacrifice? Is the Ritvij office not abandoned by others? Is the sacrificial fee plentiful?' It is a very singular fact, that on the one hand the assistance of a number of Ṛtvijas was unanimously declared necessary for the performance of an Ahīna sacrifice, while on the other hand it was considered objectionable, at least among some of the Vedic schools, to officiate at such a sacrifice. See Weber's Indische Studien, X, 150, 151.
