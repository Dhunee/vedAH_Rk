11 [^2] . Having wiped the ground round the fire, the student should put on a piece of wood silently. 'Silence indeed is what belongs to Prajāpati. The student becomes belonging to Prajāpati'this is understood (in the Śruti).


[^2]:  On the wiping of the ground round the fire, comp. above, chap. 3, 1; Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya I, 7, 11. Nārāyaṇa here has the following remarks, which I can scarcely believe to express the real meaning of this Sūtra: 'Here the wiping of the ground round the fire is out of place, because the Saṃskāras for the fire have already been performed. As to that, it should be observed that the wiping is mentioned here in order that, when fuel is put on the fire in the evening and in the morning, the sprinkling of water and the wiping may be performed. But on this occasion (at the Upanayana) the student does not perform the wiping, &c., and silently puts a piece of wood on that fire.'
