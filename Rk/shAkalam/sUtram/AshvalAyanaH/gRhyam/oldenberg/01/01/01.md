1 [^1] . The (rites) based on the spreading (of the three sacred fires) have been declared; we shall declare the Gṛhya (rites).


[^1]:  1, 1. The spreading (vitāna or, as it is also called, vihāra or vistāra) of the sacred fires is the taking of two of the three sacrificial fires, the Āhavanīya fire and the Dakṣiṇāgni, out of the Gārhapatya fire (see, for instance, Weber's Indische Studien, IX, 216 seq.). The rites based on, or connected with the vitāna; are the rites forming the subject of the Śrauta ritual, which are to be performed with the three fires.
