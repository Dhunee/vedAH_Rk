To Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, to him who offers the oblations for general expiation, so that they are well offered, to him who makes us succeed in what we desire! Make us in all that we desire successful!

[^6]:  Professor Stenzler here very pertinently refers to Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa I, 6, 3, 38.

[^7]:  It is doubtful whether this paragraph should be considered as forming part of the quotation from the Śruti. The object of this passage is, in my opinion, to explain why the southern Ājyabhāga belongs to Soma, who is the presiding deity of the north, and the northern Ājyabhāga to Agni, the presiding deity of the south-east. Professor Stenzler's opinion about this paragraph is somewhat different.

[^12]:  'A full vessel which has been put down before, he should now pour out on the Barhis.' Nārāyaṇa.

[^13]:  This pouring out of the vessel holds here the place of the Avabhṛtha bath at the end of the Soma sacrifice. See Weber, Indische Studien, X, 393 seq.
