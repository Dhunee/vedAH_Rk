14 [^7] . Without that leading round (the fire, she sacrifices grain) with the neb of a basket towards herself silently a fourth time.


[^7]:  14, 15. According to those teachers whose opinion is related in S큰tras 6-14, the leading round the fire, the treading on the stone, and the offering of fried grain (with the three parts of the Mantra, S큰tra 1 3) are repeated thrice; then follows the offering prescribed in S큰tra 14, so that the last two offerings follow immediately on each other. This is not the case, if in the first three instances the order of the different rites is inverted, as stated in S큰tra 15.
