9 [^5] . Three times for descendants of Jamadagni.


[^5]:  The two portions of fried grain poured over the bride's hands, together with the first (upastaraṇa) and the second (pratyabhighāraṇa) pouring out of Ājya, constitute the four Avattas, or portions cut off from the Havis. The descendants of Jamadagni were pañcāvattinas, i.e. they used to cut off five such portions (see Kātyāyana I, 9, 3; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 95); so they had to pour out the fried grain three times.
