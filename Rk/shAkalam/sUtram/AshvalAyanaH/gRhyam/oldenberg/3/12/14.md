14 [^4] . The Sauparṇa is (the hymn), 'May the streams of honey and ghee flow forwards.'


[^4]:  This hymn is not found in any Vedic Saṃhitā, as far s I know, nor does it occur in the Suparṇādhyāya. I have followed Prof. Stenzler's conjecture pra dhārā yantu instead of pradhārayantu, which is confirmed by Sāyaṇa's note on Aitareya Brāhmaṇa VI, 25, 7; VIII, 10, 4 (pp. 365, 399 ed. Aufrecht).
