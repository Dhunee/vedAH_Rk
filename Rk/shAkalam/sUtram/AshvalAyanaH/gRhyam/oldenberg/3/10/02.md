2 [^2] . (And should say), 'Here we will dwell, sir!'


[^2]:  Śāṅkhāyana II, 18, 1. Sāṅkh. has ahaṃ vatsyāmi; Āśvalāyana, idaṃ vatsyārnaḥ. The commentator says that instead of idaṃ the Āśrama is to be named which the student chooses to enter upon, for instance, Devadatta, we will dwell in the state of a householder, sir!'
