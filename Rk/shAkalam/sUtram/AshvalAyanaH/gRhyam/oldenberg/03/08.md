[^1]:  8, 6. 'On high' means 'not on the ground' (Nārāyaṇa). On the gaudānikaṃ karma (the shaving of the beard), comp. above, Adhyāya I, Kaṇḍikā 18. The word 'ceremony' would mean here, according to Nārāyaṇa, that he should perform the rite alone, without observing such prescriptions as stated above, I, 18, 7.

[^2]:  Thus, instead of 'Herb! protect him!' (I, 17, 8) he is to say, 'Herb! protect me!' and so on.

[^3]:  Ekaklītaka is, according to Nārāyaṇa and the Prayogaratna, the seed of such a Karañja fruit (Pongamia Glabra, Vent.) which contains only one grain of seed. Such grains are pounded before he rubs himself therewith.

[^4]:  On the hymn beginning with the words 'Giving life,' see Prof. Stenzler's note on this Sūtra. Its first verse is identical with Vājasaneyi Saṃhitā XXXIV, 50 (comp. also Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya III, 1, 7), and so are most of its verses found in that Saṃhitā or in the Atharva-veda; the whole of it occurs among the Rig-veda Khilas (vol. vi, p. 25, 2-12).
