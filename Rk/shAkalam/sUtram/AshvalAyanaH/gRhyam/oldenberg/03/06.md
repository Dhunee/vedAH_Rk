[^1]:  6, 1. Nārāyaṇa divides this Sūtra into two: 1. atha kāmyānāṃ sthāne kāmyāḥ; 2. caravaḥ.

[^2]:  Nārāyaṇa is evidently wrong in explaining caityaṃ yūpañ ca by agnicayanasthaṃ yūpaṃ (which is not, as Prof. Stenzler takes it, der Opferpfahl auf einem Bestattungsplatze). Comp. Gobhila III, 3, 34; Gṛhya-saṃgraha-pariśiṣṭa II, 4.
