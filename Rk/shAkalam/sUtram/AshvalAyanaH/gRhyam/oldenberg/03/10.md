## 03
3. With a loud voice (the words) following after the name.

## 04
4. 'Of inhalation and exhalation'(this he says) with a low voice,

## 05
5. And (the verse), 'Come hither, Indra, with thy lovely-sounding, fallow-coloured (horses)' (Rig-veda III, 45, 1).

## 06
6 [^3] . The aged one then murmurs, 'To inhalation and exhalation I, the wide-extended one, resort with thee. To the god Savitṛ I give thee in charge'and the verse.

## 07
7. When he has finished (that verse), and has muttered, 'Om! Forwards! Blessing!' and recited (over the student the hymn), 'The great bliss of the three' (Rig-veda X, 185)(he should dismiss him).

## 08
8. On one who has been thus dismissed, danger comes from no sidethus it is understood (in the Śruti).

## 09
9. If he hears (on his way) disagreeable voices of birds, he should murmur the two hymns, 'Shrieking, manifesting his being' (Rig-veda II, 42, 43), and (the verse), 'The divine voice have the gods created' (Rig-veda VIII, 100, 11).

May they find none who knows them and no support; divided by discord may they go to death'

## 12
12. He turns the churning-stick downwards with (the verse), 'The combined wealth of both, heaped together' (Rig-veda X, 84, 7).



[^1]:  10, 1. Nārāyaṇa refers this rule to a student who has performed the Samāvartana and wishes to go away. But a comparison of Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya II, 18 seems to make it probable that the ceremony described here has nothing to do with the Samāvartana.

[^2]:  Śāṅkhāyana II, 18, 1. Sāṅkh. has ahaṃ vatsyāmi; Āśvalāyana, idaṃ vatsyārnaḥ. The commentator says that instead of idaṃ the Āśrama is to be named which the student chooses to enter upon, for instance, Devadatta, we will dwell in the state of a householder, sir!'

[^3]:  I have translated, as Prof. Stenzler has also done, according to Śāṅkhāyana's reading, prāṇāpānā . . . tvayā. The 'aged one' is the teacher, the verse that which is quoted in Sūtra 5.
