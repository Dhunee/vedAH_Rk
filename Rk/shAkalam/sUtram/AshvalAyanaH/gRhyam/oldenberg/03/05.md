[^1]:  5, 2, 3. Perhaps the division of these Sūtras should be altered, so that śrāvaṇasya would belong to Sūtra 2. In this case we should have to translate, '2. When the herbs appear, (on a day on which the moon stands in conjunction) with Śravaṇa. 3. Or on the fifth (Tithi) of the Śrāvaṇa month, under (the Nakṣatra) Hasta.' Comp. śrāvaṇasya pañcamīm, Par. II, 10, 2. If we count the month beginning with the bright fortnight, and assume that the full moon day of Śrāvaṇa falls, as the name of the month implies, on Śravaṇa, the fifth Tithi of that month will fall indeed on Hasta. Comp. on the dates of the Upākaraṇa, Prof. Weber's remarks, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra II, 322, and on the special symbolical signification of the Nakṣatra Śravaṇa in this connection, my note on Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 2.

[^2]:  On the two Ājya portions, comp. above, I, 3, 5; 10, 13 seqq.

[^3]:  Comp. Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 8. The verses with which the oblations are performed, are the first and last verses of each Maṇḍala.

[^4]:  This is the last verse of the Ṛk-Saṃhitā in the Bāṣkala Śākhā. See my note on Śāṅkhāyana IV, 5, 9.

[^5]:  The expression, 'Those deities' would, according to Nārāyaṇa, refer not only to the deities stated in Sūtra 4, but also to the deities of the first and last verses of the Maṇḍalas (Sūtras 6 seqq.). On the grains with curds, comp. Sūtra 5. The technical sense of the 'cleaning' is explained in the Śrauta-sūtra I, 8, 2; comp. Hillebrandt, Das altindische Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 130, note 1. The sacrificer covers his joined hands with the Kuśa grass spread out round the fire, and has water sprinkled on them.

[^6]:  On the term brahmāñjali, comp. Manu II, 71.

[^7]:  On the Samāvartana, see below, chap. 8 seq. The restrictions referred to consist in the interdiction of eating honey and meat, of having sexual intercourse, of sleeping in a bedstead and in the day-time, &c. Nārāyaṇa.

[^8]:  I.e. the Brahmacārins.

[^9]:  I.e. one who has performed the Samāvartana.
