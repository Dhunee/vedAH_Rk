4 [^4] . Even he who only puts a piece of wood (on the fire) full of belief, should think, 'Here I offer a sacrifice; adoration to that (deity)!'


[^4]:  The words of the Ṛc, 'with an oblation,' are here repeated, the Vedic instrumental āhutī being replaced and explained by the regular form āhutyā.

(The Ṛc quoted above then says), 'He who with an oblation' - and, 'He who with knowledge;' even by learning only satisfaction is produced (in the gods).

Seeing this the Ṛṣi has said, 'To him who does not keep away from himself the cows, to him who longs for cows, who dwells in the sky, speak a wonderful word, sweeter than ghee and honey.' Thereby he means, 'This my word, sweeter than ghee and honey, is satisfaction (to the god); may it be sweeter.'

(And another Ṛṣi says), 'To thee, O Agni, by this Ṛc we offer an oblation prepared by our heart; may these be oxen, bulls, and cows.' (Thereby he means), 'They are my oxen, bulls, and cows (which I offer to the god), they who study this text, reciting it for themselves (as their Svādhyāya).'

(And further on the Ṛc quoted above says), 'He who (worships Agni) with adoration, offering rich sacrifices.' 'Verily also by the performing of adoration (the gods may be worshipped); for the gods are not beyond the performing of adoration; adoration verily is sacrifice' - thus runs a Brāhmaṇa.
