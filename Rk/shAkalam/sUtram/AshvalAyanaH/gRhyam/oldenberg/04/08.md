[^10]:  Manu III, 209; Yājñavalkya I, 231.

[^11]:  The oblations alluded to in this Sūtra are prescribed in the Śrauta-sūtra, II, 6, 12. They are directed to Soma pitṛmat and to Agni kavyavāhana.

[^12]:  According to Manu (III, 212) this is done only in case there is no fire. Possibly abhyanujñāyām belongs to Sūtra 20, so that we should have to translate, 'He then sacrifices . . . if they give their permission. Or in the hands.'

[^13]:  'The food which is left from the oblations he puts with the food (Sūtra 23) which is to be eaten by the Brāhmaṇas, and has been put into the vessels.' Nārāyaṇa.

[^14]:  Is sṛṣṭam to be understood in the sense of visṛṣṭam? Nārāyaṇa explains it by prabhūtam.

[^15]:  The verses containing the word madhu are Rig-veda I, 90, 6-8.

[^16]:  On the question, 'Relished?' compare Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya IV, 2, 5. For several kinds of Śrāddha ceremonies a Sthālīpāka is prescribed, for others it is not; for the Śrāddhas of the last kind the words 'Together with the Sthālīpāka' are not valid.

[^17]:  They reply, 'Om! Svadhā!'
