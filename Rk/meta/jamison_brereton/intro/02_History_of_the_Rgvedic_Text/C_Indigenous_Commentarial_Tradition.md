title = "C Indigenous Commentarial Tradition"

+++
With regard to indigenous commentary, the situation of the R̥gveda differs markedly from that of standard Classical Sanskrit texts, in that there is no unbroken  commentarial tradition that might preserve the understanding of the text by the  authors and audience at the time of composition. Although we find implicit commentary on some parts of the R̥gveda already in later Vedic texts, it is clear that in  many case this “commentary” is based more on adaptation, speculation, or fancy  than on a direct transmission of the purport of the text, as when the Śatapatha  Brāhmaṇa (XI.5.1) sketches a narrative background for the Purūravas and Urvaśī dialogue (R̥V X.95) that distorts or misunderstands crucial portions of the hymn.+++(5)+++ The first complete de facto commentary on the R̥gveda, dating probably from  the late Vedic period, is Śākalya’s Padapāṭha mentioned above, which simply consists of an effectively linguistic analysis of the continuous text (the Saṃhitāpāṭha)  of the R̥gveda into individual words (padas). Because of sandhi, an important and  pervasive feature of the Sanskrit language whereby all words undergo significant  phonological adjustment to adjacent words in context, the phonological restora tion of the underlying pausal forms of words from the continuous reading is no mere mechanical operation, but presupposes a grammatical and semantic analysis  of the text. 

The Nighaṇṭu is a collection of difficult Vedic words probably made likewise  in the late Vedic period. The Nighaṇṭu and the commentary upon this collection  by Yāska in his Nirukta provide early lexical and etymological approaches to the  R̥gveda, though understanding “etymology” in a synchronic+++(??)+++, rather than our current diachronic sense.

Various indexes or anukramaṇīs to the R̥gveda, also mentioned above, were compiled probably around the middle of the first millennium bce, attributed to Śaunaka;  these were not fully preserved. A comprehensive index, the Sarvānukramaṇī, attrib uted to Kātyāyana and dating perhaps to the mid-fourth century bce but drawing  on the earlier indexes, provides, for each hymn, the poet, the god(s) to which it is  addressed, and the meter(s) in which it is composed. The Br̥haddevatā, also attributed to Śaunaka, is in essence also an anukramaṇī, specifically an index to the deities of each hymn, but in expanded form, with a number of interesting narratives  and legends interspersed in the dry sequential listing of hymns and their divinities.+++(4)+++
 
None of these ancient tools and treatments remotely approaches the standard  type of commentary familiar for later Sanskrit texts. For this the R̥gveda had to  wait until the medieval period. The most influential and lasting commentary on the  text was made by Sāyaṇa in the fourteenth century ce in South India, although there  were a number of pre-Sāyaṇa commentators, some of whose work survives in part.  Sāyaṇa’s work essentially superseded these earlier works, and remains enormously  important in both indigenous and Western interpretations of the text: Max Müller’s  edition of the R̥gveda includes Sāyaṇa’s commentary, and Geldner’s translation, for  example, owes much to Sāyaṇa.+++(4)+++ It should be remembered, however, that Sāyaṇa is  temporally closer to our own age than to that of the R̥gveda, and he was writing  in a very different geographical, political, and religious landscape from that of the  R̥gveda. It is therefore more useful to read Sāyaṇa not as a direct conduit of the  “true meaning” of the R̥gveda but as a scholar grappling with the same problems  as modern interpreters, and bringing to bear all the intelligence and knowledge he  can muster, just as we do.+++(5)+++
