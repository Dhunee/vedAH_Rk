title = "K VĀyu / VĀta “Wind”"

+++
As his name indicates, Vāyu is an ancient god of the Wind, although verses to Vāyu  that refer to the phenomenon of wind are somewhat rare and oblique. For example, the roar of Vāyu echoes the sound of the wind, his hundredfold (I.135.3) or thou sandfold (I.135.1) team reflects the wind’s speed, and the Maruts, who personify  thunderstorms especially the monsoon storms, are born from his belly (I.134.4).  Such characteristics show Vāyu’s close connection to the wind, even though he does  not represent the wind directly. 

On the soma-pressing day, Vāyu is the first of the gods to receive the soma  (I.134.1, 6; VII.92.1; cf. II.11.14), which he drinks unmixed (I.134.5, VII.90.1–2).+++(5)+++  But Vāyu also arrives with Indra on the same chariot, and the two of them share the  first drink of soma. Just how both Vāyu and Vāyu and Indra have the first drink of  soma is unclear, but, following a suggestion of Oberlies (1999: 155), perhaps Vāyu’s  first drink reflects soma’s symbolic descent through the midspace as it is filtered,  and the first drink of Vāyu and Indra is the first soma libation. 

The ordinary word for the wind is vā́ta, and unlike Vāyu, the god Vāta closely  reflects the character and activity of the wind. He goes shattering and thundering, raising the dust; he moves through the midspace and is the companion of the  waters. The symbolic features of Vāta likewise reflect the wind. Vāta is the breath  (ātmán) of the gods (X.168.4), and as the lifebreath, he is the father, brother, and  companion of the man whom he makes live (X.186.1–3). Like the Sun and the  Dawn, therefore, Vāta, the Wind, is completely transparent to the natural phenomenon to which his name refers.
