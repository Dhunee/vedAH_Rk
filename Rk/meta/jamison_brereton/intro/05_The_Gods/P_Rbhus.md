+++
In some forms of the soma sacrifice, the three R̥bhus have a significant role as principal soma recipients in the Third Pressing. But despite that role, they have a limited  presence in the R̥gveda itself. Only ten hymns are dedicated to the R̥bhus, together  with one other that invokes the R̥bhus along with Indra. Nonetheless, despite their  decidedly low profile in the R̥gveda, their principal actions emerge clearly. The  R̥bhu hymns repeatedly return to five great deeds for which the R̥bhus are famed.  

- They took a soma cup made by the god Tvaṣṭar and fashioned it into four cups  (III.60.2; IV.33.5, 35.2, 3, 36.4). 
- They made a chariot, sometimes identified as the  chariot of the Aśvins (I.20.3, 111.1, 161.3; IV.33.8).
- They created the two fallow bay  horses of Indra (I.20.2, 111.1; III.60.2; IV.33.10, 34.9, 35.5).
- They fashioned a cow,  or made a cow give milk, or carved up a cow (I.20.3, 110.8, 161.7, 10; IV.33.4).
- And  lastly, they rejuvenated their aging parents (I.20.4, 110.8, 111.1; IV.33.3, 35.5, 36.3).  

Significantly, as a result of these creative acts, the R̥bhus are said to have attained  immortality or to have become gods. 

## Ritual interpretation
Their skillful acts are essentially priestly, and their great deeds reflect ritual acts  or, more specifically, ritual acts at the Third Pressing. The four soma cups they created are the cups of the four principal soma-drinkers: Indra and the three R̥bhus.  As mentioned above, the Aśvins’ chariot can represent the sacrifice, and therefore  the chariot they made could be the sacrifice in general. The creation of the fallow  bays of Indra is reflected by a special soma offering in the Third Pressing that marks  the departure of the two horses of Indra. The cow over which they work may represent the soma stalks from the previous soma-pressings, which are pressed again  at the Third Pressing. The R̥bhus cause these depleted “cows” to release even more  milk, which is the soma juice. Their last deed, the rejuvenation of their parents, is  more mysterious, but it might represent the return or “rejuvenation” of the Aśvins at the end of the sacrifice in an Overnight rite or it could reflect the rejuvenation  of the sacrificer and his wife, since the fertility of the sacrificing couple is a theme  of the Third Pressing. For a more detailed discussion of the acts of the R̥bhus and  their meaning, see Brereton (2012).
