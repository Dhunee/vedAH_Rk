title = "N Heaven and Earth"

One of the most remarkable and satisfying phrasal equations across the older  Indo-European languages is that of Vedic dyaúṣ pitā́ “father Heaven” with Greek  Zeus Pater and Latin Jupiter, thus attesting to a deified paternal Heaven for  Proto-Indo-European as well as the older daughter languages. Ironically perhaps,  the Vedic god, the meaning of whose name is still transparent and lexically additive, is far less important in the Vedic pantheon than his correspondents in the  Classical languages, where the original semantics have become attenuated or have  disappeared entirely. 

In the R̥gveda, Heaven as a divinity is generally paired with the female Earth,  who is frequently referred to as “mother,” with the two a complementary paren tal pair. They are normally grammatically joined in a dual dvandva compound  (dyā́vā-pr̥thivī́), and several hymns are dedicated to this couple. 

If Heaven and  Earth are the archetypal parents, who are their progeny? This is mentioned less  than one might expect, but in a few hymns it is clearly stated that the gods are their  children and especially the Sun. A less beneficent aspect of Heaven’s fatherhood is  found in a myth, obliquely but vividly referred to a few times in the R̥gveda (I.71.5,  8; X.61.5–7) and told more clearly in Vedic prose (though with Prajāpati substituting for Heaven)—namely his rape of his own daughter. 

Heaven and Earth also give shape to and encompass the cosmos, providing a  safe enclosure within which life can flourish. The separation of the two to create this space is the primal cosmogonic moment, and Indra’s accomplishment of this  separation by propping them apart is endlessly celebrated.+++(4)+++
