title = "C Viśve DevĀḤ"

+++
The term víśve devā́ḥ “all the gods” or “the All Gods” is common in the R̥gveda,  and the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of a large number of hymns as víśve  devā́ḥ. The term, both in its usage in the text and in its application to a hymn type,  is employed in a number of different senses. On the one hand, it is a handy way to  refer to the whole divine community, to ensure that no god has been left out of a  generic eulogy or request for aid. In this usage the gods are not treated as individuals but as an undifferentiated group, opposed to mortals or, later, the Asuras (see  just above). This group ultimately becomes conceived of as a sort of corporate  entity, the All Gods. On the other hand, many Viśve Devāḥ hymns do not encompass the whole group, but name a series of individual gods, each one often allotted  a single verse in a list hymn (e.g., VI.49). Here the phrase “all the gods” is a way  of indicating that the hymn is not targeting a single god, as in the majority or  R̥gvedic hymns, but selecting from the group. And finally a number of hymns with  the Anukramaṇī designation “all gods” actually have very little to do with the gods  at all, but contain meditations on the mysteries of the cosmos, of the sacrifice, or of  the powers of poetry and ritual speech (see, e.g., I.105).+++(4)+++
