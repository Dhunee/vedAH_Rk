title = "B Homology"

+++
The Vedic mental universe is structured, in great part, by a web of identifications  or equivalences among elements in the ritual realm, in the cosmic realm, and in the  realm of the everyday. These homologies play an enormous role in the thought of  the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, where knowing the hidden connections between  apparently disparate elements, particularly the equivalences between cosmic and  ritual elements, gives the knower some power to control the cosmic by manipulation  of the ritual.+++(5)+++ In these later Vedic texts, such types of equivalences have a technical  name—bandhu “bond, connection” (a word of course cognate with English “bind,”  etc.)—and the difference between the cosmic and the mundane system of equations  is pervasive enough to be distinguished by technical terms+++(5)+++: the cosmic level is called  adhidaivam or adhidevatam, roughly “concerned with the divine,” while the mundane is called adhyātmam, roughly “concerned with the person(al).” These two systems meet in and focus on the sacrifice, a controlled and orderly sphere of human  activity, as a way of modeling the complex web of relationships that obtain in the  two other realms, which are not under human control. The level of the sacrifice is  called adhiyajñam “relating to the sacrifice.” 

Although the correspondences are not as systematically worked out and presented in the R̥gveda as in those later texts, this way of thinking is just as pervasive  in that text, though backgrounded:  the poets assume that they share with their  audience a web of associations, and this shared knowledge allows the poet to sub stitute one element for another without overt signaling. Thus, for example, the first rays of light at dawn are homologized to cows+++(4)+++, as in the Vala myth discussed above,  and therefore the goddess Dawn is called “the mother of cows” and images of  ruddy cows overrun the hymns to Dawn. Cows also have a ritual association: milk  is mixed with the soma juice after it is pressed, and so the soma hymns are filled  with depictions of the soma (as bull) running toward or mixing with “the cows,”  that is, the milk.+++(5)+++ And cows are also homologized to waters, particularly the waters  confined by Vr̥tra and released by Indra’s killing of that demon. 

Modern readers of the R̥gveda must try to internalize the many associations and  identifications that formed the unconscious mental universe of the contemporary  audience; otherwise almost every hymn in many of its parts will seem unintelligible  or nonsensical. Other important homologies include that between the sun and the  fire, especially the ritual fire, and, in general, the many associations between the  various parts and procedures of the ritual and both cosmic and everyday elements.  For example, the ritual itself, or the praise hymn specifically, is often identified with  a chariot, and the crafting of poetry is homologized to chariot-making.+++(4)+++ Soma is  often identified with a bull, but often otherwise with a horse, and the ritual preparation of the soma is equated with the grooming of this horse.+++(4)+++ Or he is a bird settling  into his nest or a king embarking on conquest.+++(4)+++ The ritual ground itself is often identified with the cosmos, with the ritual fire a pillar connecting heaven and earth and  any movement on the ritual ground implicitly compared to a vast journey across  or around the cosmos.+++(4)+++ It is not possible here to list anything approaching all the  important connections that underlie R̥gvedic poetry, though we will try to sketch  many such associations in particular circumstances. But the reader must be alert  to, and open to, this overall substitution principle, and also recognize that these  homologies are not mere poetic embellishments, imagery for its own sake, but an  implicit statement about the way things really are, the pervasive underlying connections unifying apparently disparate elements. 

It is one of the poet’s main jobs to find and articulate these hidden connections,  and the theme of “secret names” and their discovery is an important one in the  R̥gveda. Indeed, one of the great deeds attributed to Indra (as Br̥haspati) and to the  poet-singers, the Aṅgirases, divine counterparts of the human poet—the splitting  of the Vala cave and the release of the cows imprisoned therein — turns in some  versions on discovering the cows’ hidden names (e.g., IV.1.16, X.68.7). The training  of a poet clearly involved both producing and solving quite recherché associations,  and the genre of riddle displays these skills to great advantage.
