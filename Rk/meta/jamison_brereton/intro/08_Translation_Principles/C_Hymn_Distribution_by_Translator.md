title = "C Hymn Distribution by Translator"

+++
At the beginning of this project, we two translators each took primary responsibility for approximately half the hymns of the R̥gveda and produced first and usually  second drafts of them. As the project continued, we consulted with each other at  every turn, passed hymns back and forth, and read each other’s translations critically. In the end, however, the final version of each hymn became the responsibility  of a single translator. The division of those final versions is as follows:
