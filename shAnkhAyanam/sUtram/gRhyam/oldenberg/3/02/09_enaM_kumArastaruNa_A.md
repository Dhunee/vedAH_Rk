Sūtra 8: Vasūṃś ca Rudrān Ādityān Īśānaṃ jagadaiḥ saha; jagada is explained in Jayarāma's commentary by anuga, anucara). The word jagada of course was exposed to all sorts of corruptions; p. 94 thus the text of Āśvalāyana has jāyatāṃ saka; the Atharva-veda (III, 12, 7) jagatā saha; and from this jagat to the bhuvana found in our text the way is not very long.
