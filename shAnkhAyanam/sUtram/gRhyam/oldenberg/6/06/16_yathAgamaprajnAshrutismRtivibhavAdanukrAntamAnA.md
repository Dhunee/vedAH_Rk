16. (The final benedictory formula runs thus), 'Through the power of wisdom, of Śruti and Smṛti, as handed down by tradition, through (that power) which has its measure in (the Vedic texts) that have been gone through(?), and which is possessed of undisputed firmness, may peace be with us in welfare. Adoration be to gods, Ṛṣis, Manes, and men! May they whom we have adored, make happy life, beauty, health, peace, incolumity, imperishableness, vigour, splendour, glory, power, holy lustre, renown, age, offspring, cattle, adoration, increase. From wrongly spoken, wrongly used (prayer), from everything that is deficient or excessive, for the good of gods and Ṛṣis, may the Brahman and Truth protect me; may the Brahman and Truth protect me!'
