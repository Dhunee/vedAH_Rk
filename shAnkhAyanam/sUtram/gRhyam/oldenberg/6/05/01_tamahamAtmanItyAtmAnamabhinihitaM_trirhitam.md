1 [^2]. 'That (I place) within myself' - with (these words they turn their thoughts to the universal) Self that is placed (within themselves?) three times repeated (?).


[^2]:  5, 1. Nārāyaṇa says that dadhe is supplied to this Mantra from the preceding Sūtra, and so indeed the Mantra is given in the Aitareya recension. The translation of abhinihitaṃ trir hitam is merely tentative; see Nārāyaṇa's note, p. 165, of the German edition. Perhaps abhinihitaṃ should be taken in its grammatical value, and the Sūtra should be translated, "That (I place) into myself (ātmani)" - with these words (they look) at themselves, pronouncing (the word ātmani) with Abhinidhāna, three times repeated (?).' On abhinidhāna, comp. Professor Max Müller's edition of the Rig-veda Prātiśākhya, pp. cxvii seqq.
