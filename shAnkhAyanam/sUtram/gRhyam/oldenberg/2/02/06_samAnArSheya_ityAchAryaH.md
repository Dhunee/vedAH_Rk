6 [^4] . 'Descending from the same Ṛṣis?' says the teacher.


[^4]:  6, 7. A similar dialogue between the teacher and the student at the Upanayana is given in the Kauśika-sūtra (ap. Weber, Indische Studien, X, 71). The student there says, 'Make me an Ārsheya (a descendant of the Ṛṣis) and one who has relations, and initiate me.' And the teacher replies, 'I make thee an Ārsheya and one who has relations, and I initiate thee.' As in this passage of the Kauśika-sūtra the teacher is represented as having the power of making, by the Upanayana ceremony, an Ārsheya of the student, thus, according to the view expressed by Professor Weber (loc. cit., p. 72 seq.), Śāṅkhāyana would even give it into the teacher's power to make the student his samānārsheya, i.e. to extend his own Ārsheya on as many pupils as he likes. Professor Weber understands the sixth Sūtra so that the teacher would have to say, samānārsheyo bhavān brūhi (Nārāyaṇa: bhavān brūhīti brahmacārī bhavān brūhīty ataḥ [Sūtra 8] siṃhāvalokananyāyenātrānuṣajyate. According to Rāmacandra's Paddhati he is p. 63 only to say samānārsheyaḥ). The student answers, samānārsheyo ’ham bho; Professor Weber, who supplies the imperative asāni, translates this, 'May I have the same Ārsheya, sir!'
