[^1]:  12, 1 seq. The Indian tradition (with the exception only, as far as is known to me, of the Śāmbavya commentary) refers the ceremonies described in this chapter, like those treated of in chap. 11, as well to the Śukriya as to the Śākvara and the other Vratas. This is not correct. The eleventh chapter gives the rites common to the four Vratas; the Śukriya vrata is connected with no special ceremonies beside those, so that the exposition of this Vrata is brought to an end in that chapter. The last Sūtra of chap. 11 marks the transition to the special rites which are peculiar to the three other Vratas, and are connected with the character of mystical secrecy attributed to the Āraṇyaka, and thus it is with the exclusion of the Sukriya that the twelfth chapter refers only to those Vratas. The difference which we have pointed out between the two chapters finds its characteristic expression in Sūtras 9 and 11 of chap. 11, compared with chap. 12, 13. 14; in the former Sūtras the statements there given are expressly extended to the Sukriya, the Śākvara, the Vrātika, and the Aupaniṣada, while in the latter passage mention is made first of the Mahānāmnīs, i.e. the text corresponding to the Śākvara vrata, and then the uttarāṇi prakaraṇāni (the following sections) are referred to, i.e. the Mahāvrata and the Upaniṣad, so that the Sukriya vrata or the texts, the study of which is entered upon by that Vrata, are left out here.
