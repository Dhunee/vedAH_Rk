27 [^12] . This has been (further) explained in (the treatise about) the Ṛṣisvādhyāya.


[^12]:  Nārāyaṇa explains Ṛṣisvādhyāya by mantrasaṃhitā. He says, The Anuvācana which has been declared here, is to be understood also with regard to the svādhyāya, i.e. to the Saṃhitā of the Mantras.' I think there is a blunder in the MS., and instead of tad api svādhyāye . . . jñeyaṃ we ought to read tad ṛṣisvādhyāye . . . jñeyaṃ. In this case we should have to translate the quoted passage, '. . . is to be understood with regard to the Ṛṣisvādhyāya, i.e. to, &c.' - I think, however, that the true meaning of the Sūtra is different from what Nārāyaṇa believes it to be. The expression vyākhyātam apparently conveys a reference to another treatise in which the rules regarding the Ṛṣisvādhyāya would seem to have been fully set forth. The Śrauta-sūtra contains p. 73 no passage which could be the one here referred to; we may suppose, therefore, that either a chapter of a Prātiśākhya is quoted here, or a separate treatise on the special subject of the Ṛṣisvādhyāya. References to such treatises are found in the Sūtra texts in several instances, of which the most important is that in the Gobhila-Gṛhya I, 5, 13, 'On what day the moon becomes full, the knowledge thereof is contained in a special text; that one either should study or ascertain when the Parvan is from those who have studied it.'
