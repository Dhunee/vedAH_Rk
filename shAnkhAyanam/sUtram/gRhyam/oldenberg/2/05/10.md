10 [^4] . After (the student) has said, 'Recite, sir!' - 


[^4]:  10, 11. The Indian tradition divides these Sūtras after ācāryaḥ, so that the words adhīhi bho would have to be pronounced by the teacher. Thus also Nārāyaṇa explains, ācārya adhīhi bho 3 iti māṇavakam uktvā, &c. In my opinion it is the student or the students who say adhīhi bho. Thus the Prātiśākhya (Sūtra 831, ed. Max Müller) says, 'They invite him with the words adhīhi bho 3, all the students the teacher, having embraced his feet.' Comp. also below, IV, 8, 12, the greater part of which Sūtra is word for word identical with these rules; VI, 3, 6; Gautama I, 46; Gobhila II, 10, 38.
