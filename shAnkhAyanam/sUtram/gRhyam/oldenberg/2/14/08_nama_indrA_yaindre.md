8 [^4] . Then (turned) towards the disk of the sun, 'Adoration to Aditi and to the Ādityas! Adoration


[^4]:  The commentators (see p. 142 of the German edition) differ as to whether ādityamaṇḍala means the disk of the sun towards which this Bali should be offered, or a place or an apartment of circular form (ādityamaṇḍalarūpe maṇḍalāgāre, as in my opinion we ought to correct the reading in Nārāyaṇa's note).
