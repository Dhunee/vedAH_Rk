1 [^1] . 'Waters are ye by name; happy ones are ye by name; sappy ones are ye by name; undecaying ones are ye by name; fearless ones are ye by name; immortal ones are ye by name. Of you, being such, may I partake; receive me into your favour' - with these words (the teacher) makes the student sip water three times,


[^1]:  6, 1, 2. Rāmacandra: '. . . with this Mantra which the teacher tells him, and which he (the student) pronounces, he sips water p. 68 three times . . . He (the teacher) then gives him again the staff, which he had given him before silently.' I do not think that this double handing over of the staff agrees with the real meaning of the text; Gobhila also (II, 10) and Āśvalāyana (I, 22, 1) prescribe the daṇḍapradāna after the repetition of the Sāvitrī, without mentioning that the same had been already done before; Pāraskara II, 2, II speaks of the handing over of the staff before the recital of the Sāvitrī, and does not state that it should be repeated afterwards.
