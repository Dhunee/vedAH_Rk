[^1]:  8, 1. This is the Anupravacanīyahoma treated of by Āśvalāyana at I, 22, 12 seq. There it is stated that this sacrifice should be performed as well after the recitation of the Sāvitrī as after the other p. 74 portions of the Veda, for instance, as the commentary there has it, after the Mahānāmnīs, the Mahāvrata, and the Upaniṣad have been recited. Nārāyaṇa indicates the time of this sacrifice in the words, 'On that same fast-day (chap. 7, 29) in the afternoon.'
