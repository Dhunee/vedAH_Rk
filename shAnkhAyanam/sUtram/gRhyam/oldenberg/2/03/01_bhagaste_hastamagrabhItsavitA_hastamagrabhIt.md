1 [^1] . 'Bhaga has seized thy hand, Savitar has seized thy hand, Pūṣan has seized thy hand, Aryaman has seized thy hand. Mitra art thou by right, Agni is thy teacher, and I, N.N., both of us. Agni, I give this student in charge to thee. Indra, I give this student in charge to thee. Sun, I give this student in charge to thee. Viśve devās, I give this student in charge to you, for the sake of long life, of blessed offspring and strength, of increase of wealth, of mastership of all Vedas, of renown, of bliss.'


[^1]:  3. 1. T. Nārāyaṇa: 'Instead of asau (N.N.) he puts the name of the student in the vocative case.' I think rather that the teacher here pronounced his own name. Comp. asāv ahaṃ bho, chap. 2, 5, &c., and the Mantra in Pāraskara II, 2, 20.
