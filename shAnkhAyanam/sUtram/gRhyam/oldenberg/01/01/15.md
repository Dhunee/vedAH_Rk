15 [^8] . 'The kinds of Pākayajñas, the kinds of Haviryajñas, and again the kinds of Soma sacrifices,


[^8]:  With regard to the twenty-one kinds of sacrifice compare, for instance, Gautama VIII, 18-20; Max Müller, ZḌṂJ. IX, p. lxxiii; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 326. The seven kinds of Pākayajñas are the Aṣṭakā sacrifices (see below, III, 12 seq.), the sacrifices offered at each Parvan (I, 3), the Śrāddha (or funeral) sacrifices (IV, 1 seq.), the sacrifice of the Śrāvaṇī full moon (IV, 19), of the Āgrahāyaṇī (IV, 17 seq.), of the Caitrī (IV, 19), and of the Āśvayujī (IV, 16). The seven Havis sacrifices (belonging, as is the case also with the third division of sacrifices, to the Śrauta ritual) are the Agnyādheya, the Agnihotra, the sacrifices of the full and new moon, the Āgrayaṇa, the three Cāturmāsya sacrifices, the Nirūḍhapaśubandha, and the Sautrāmaṇī. The seven kinds of Soma sacrifices (of which the more ancient texts mention only three or four saṃsthās, see Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 1 20) are the Agniṣṭoma, the Atyagniṣṭoma, the Ukthya, the Ṣoḍaśin, the Atirātra, the Aptoryāma.


'Twenty-one by number, these are proclaimed to be the kinds of sacrifice.'
