1 [^1] . 'A bull's hide' - this has been declared.


[^1]:  16, 1. In chap. 15, 22 it is said that the bride arrives at the house; in 16, 12, that she enters the house. Probably we are to understand, therefore, that the sacrifice prescribed in this chapter, Sūtras 2 seq., is performed before the house, like the Vāstoṣpatīya karman (below, III, 4). The words, 'has been declared,' refer to the Śrauta-sūtra (IV, r6, 2), 'Having spread a red bull's skin, with the neck to the north or to the east, with the hair outside, behind the fire, they sit down,' &c.
