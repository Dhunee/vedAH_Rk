2 [^2] . Let (the father) breathe three times on the new-born child and then draw in his breath with the words, 'Draw in your breath with the Ṛc, breathe within with the Yajus, breathe forth with the Sāman.'


[^2]:  Abhyavānya should be corrected into abhyapānya, as in IV, 18, 1 nearly all the MSS. read nivāta instead of nipāta. The Śāmbavya MS. reads in the text, trir abhyānyānuprāṇya; in the commentary trir aṇyapāṇyānuprāṇyā. Comp., on the terminology of the different vital airs, Speijer, Jātakarma, p. 64 seq.; Eggeling, S.B.E., vol. xii, p. 20.
