[^2]:  'When the father of the suitor and the others, together with their Ācārya, have arrived at the house of him who is to give away the girl, they station themselves in the hall, and the father of the suitor says thrice, "Here am I, N.N. (amukaśarman), Sir!" - in these words he announces himself three times . . . . For at the house of the person who gives the girl away, there arrive also, in order to see the festivities, many other people. In order to distinguish himself from these, he pronounces his name.' Nārāyaṇa.
