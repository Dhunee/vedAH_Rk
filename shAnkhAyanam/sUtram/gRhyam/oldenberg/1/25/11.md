11 [^4] . He sacrifices, when one year has expired, on the (ordinary) domestic fire.


[^4]:  'The words "every month" (Sūtra 10) retain their value p. 53(here also). Thus the sūtikāgni is to be kept through one year. After the lapse of that year one should sacrifice every month on the domestic fire as long as his life lasts. As it is said "in the domestic fire," the sūtikāgni is not to be kept any longer.' Nārāyaṇa.
