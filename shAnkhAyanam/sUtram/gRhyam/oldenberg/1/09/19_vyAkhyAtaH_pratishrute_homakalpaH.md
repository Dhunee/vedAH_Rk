19 [^10] . The ritual (here) declared of the sacrifice (to be performed) when (the father's) assent (to give away his daughter) has been declared - 


[^10]:  This Sūtra, though reckoned in the Indian tradition to p. 30 chap. 9, seems to me clearly to belong to the next chapter, and to contain the subject, to which the predicate is given in 10, 1. For pratiśrute, see chap. 7, 1.
