6 [^2] . Throws into it (branches) with milky sap and leaves, of a tree the name of which is masculine, together with Kuśa grass,


[^2]:  Sakṣīrānt sapalāśānt sakuśān. Nārāyaṇa's commentary divides sa kuśān, and refers sa to the ācārya. But this sa would be superfluous, and the substantive to which sakṣīrān and sapalāśān are to be referred, is, as both the nature of the case and the corresponding passages show, śākhān and not kuśān. Comp. the Śrauta-sūtra IV, 17, 5: palāsaśākhāṃ sapalāśāṃ nikhāya, and a passage concerning the very rite here described, Āśvalāyana-pariśiṣṭa I, 24: audumbaryārddhayā. (read, ārdrayā?) śākhayā sapalāśayā sahiraṇyapavitrayā sadūrvāpavitrayā. The MS. of the Śāmbavya-sūtra has sakṣīrān palāśān sakuśān.
