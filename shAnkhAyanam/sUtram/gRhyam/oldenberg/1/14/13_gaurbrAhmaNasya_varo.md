13 [^6] . A cow is the optional gift to be given by a Brāhmaṇa,


[^6]:  These Sūtras, treating of the fee for the sacrifice, are identical with Pāraskara I, 8, 15-18. Apparently they are taken from the same lost original from which several identical passages in the Sūtras of Pāraskara and Śāṅkhāyana seem to be derived (see the notes on chap. 5, 1; 13, 7). They stand rather out of place here, for they return to the same subject which had already been treated of in Sūtra 10, though in that Sūtra, as very frequently is the case in our text and in similar ones, only the case of the bridegroom being a Brāhmaṇa has been taken notice of.
