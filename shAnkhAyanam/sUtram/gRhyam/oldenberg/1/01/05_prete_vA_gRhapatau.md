5 [^3] . Or that after the death of the householder the eldest one himself (should kindle it).


[^3]:  Nārāyaṇa: 'If the fire has not been kindled at the time stated above, then, after the householder . . . i.e. the father, even if he should not have performed the ādhāna, or the elder brother has died, the eldest son (or the son who after his elder brother's death has become the eldest), after he has performed the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa (for the dead father or brother; see below, IV, 3, and the ninth chapter of the Pariśiṣṭa [book V]), even if he has not divided the inheritance with his younger brothers (so that the time stated in the fourth Sūtra would not have arrived), should kindle the fire himself, i.e. without an officiating priest (ṛtvij). . . . Or the Sūtra should be divided into two; prete vā gṛhapatau (or after the death of the householder), and svayaṃ jyāyān (the eminent one himself), i.e. of Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas, and Vaiśyas a jyāyān, which means a most eminent person, a Brāhmaṇa, performs the Pākayajñas himself; for the two other castes the Pākayajñas have to be performed through an officiating priest: this is the meaning of this svayaṃ (himself).' I have given this note of Nārāyaṇa as a specimen of the entirely arbitrary and obviously misleading explanations which are unfortunately so frequently found in this author, as indeed in most of the other Sūtra commentators. As to the true meaning of this svayaṃ I still adhere to the explanation which I proposed in my German edition of the text (p. 118), that in case no division of the inheritance takes place, the sacred fire should be kindled on behalf of all the joint-proprietors, but that only the eldest brother should act personally (svayaṃ).
