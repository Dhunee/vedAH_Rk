53 [^10] . (The same rules hold good,) except (those regarding) lightning, thunder, and rain, for (the study of) the Kalpa. During the five months and a half (they have to behave) as while it rains.


[^10]:  I think that this Sūtra contains two different rules which have to be separated, viz. 1. vidyutstanayitnuvarṣavarjaṃ kalpe; 2. varṣavad ardhashaṣṭheshu. The first of these rules would extend the cases of anadhyāya mentioned in this chapter to the study of the Kalpa-sūtra, except the cases of lightning, rain, &c. The second would refer to the five months and a half following on the Utsarga ceremony (comp. chap. 6, 8), and would imply that during this time the same texts are to be studied or not, according as their study is allowed or forbidden during rainfall: i.e. the study of the Saṃhitā is to be discontinued, while that of the Kalpa is allowed to go on. Rāmacandra and Nārāyaṇa differ from this interpretation; see p. 151 of the German edition.
