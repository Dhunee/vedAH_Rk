17 [^6] . 'At the time of the Upākarman and of the Utsarga an interruption (of the Veda-study) shall take place for (three days and) three nights, likewise at the Aṣṭakās for one day and one night, and so on the last night of each season.'


[^6]:  Concerning the Utsarga, see chap. 6. This Śloka occurs also Manu IV, 119 with the reading kṣepaṇam instead of kṣapaṇam ('kṣapaṇaṃ chandasāṃ virāma anadhyāyaḥ,' Nārāyaṇa). Kṣapaṇam is correct.
