[^3]:  It would be more natural to alter the division of the Sūtras, so as to bring āmantrya in the fifth, annañ ca in the seventh Sūtra. In this case we should have to translate: 5. After this, having (respectfully) spoken to them who have been adorned (by him with flowers, ornaments, &c.); 6. And having put (food) into the fire, 7. And having assigned the food to them, &c., he shall cause them to eat. - The respectful address mentioned in the fifth Sūtra consists, according to Nārāyaṇa, in the announcement, 'Ye Brāhmaṇas, I will put (food) into the fire!' (comp. Āśv.-Gṛhya IV, 7, 18), which he subsequently does with the formulas, 'To Agni Kavyavāhana svāhā! To Soma Pitṛmat svāhā! To Yama Aṅgirasvat Pitṛmat svāhā!' Comp. Baudhāyana II, 1 4, 8.
