1 [^1] . Now (follows) the Vaiśvadeva (sacrifice).


[^1]:  14, 1. The rules regarding the Vaiśvadeva sacrifice stand here, as I have already pointed out in the German edition, p. 142, in a very strange position amid the matter that concerns the student, and before the description of the ceremony that concludes studentship (the Samāvartana; III, 1). On the first word of the chapter, atha, Nārāyaṇa observes that thereby the householder is marked as the subject of the following rules. It seems rather forced to explain the position of this chapter, as Nārāyaṇa does, by pointing out that in some cases, for instance when the teacher is away on a journey, a student also can eventually be called upon to perform the Vaiśvadeva sacrifice (comp. below, chap. 17, 3).
