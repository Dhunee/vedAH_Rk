28 [^13] . When (the lesson) is finished, he takes the young Kuśa shoots, makes of cow-dung a pit at their roots, and sprinkles water on the Kuśa (shoots) for each hymn.


[^13]:  Nārāyaṇa: 'First stand the Mantras, then the Brāhmaṇa, because it contains the viniyoga (the ritual use of the Mantras), then the Smṛti texts such as Manu, &c. When he has repeated these texts to the student, after the end of the Anuvācana, the teacher should take from the student the Kuśa blades which had been taken up before for the sake of the Anuvācana (see Sūtras 5 seq.),' &c.The teacher is made the subject of this rule also by Rāmacandra. On yathāsūktam Nārāyaṇa observes that according to some teachers these water oblations were directed to the Ṛṣis of the different hymns (ṛṣīn uddiśyeti kecit). This statement seems to be countenanced by IV, 6, 6. Comp. the note below on IV, 9, 1.
