3 [^2] . 'Agni may satiate himself; Vāyu may satiate himself; Sūrya may satiate himself; Viṣṇu may satiate himself; Prajāpati may satiate himself; Virūpākṣa may satiate himself; Sahasrākṣa may satiate himself; Soma, Brahman, the Vedas, the gods, the Ṛṣis, and all the metres, the word Om, the word VAṢAṬ, the Mahāvyāhṛtis, the Sāvitrī, the sacrifices, heaven and earth, the Nakṣatras, the air, days and nights, the numbers, the twilights, the oceans, the rivers, the mountains, fields, herbs, trees, Gandharvas and Apsaras, the serpents, the birds, the Siddhas, the Sādhyas, the Vipras, the Yakṣas, the Rakṣas, the beings that have these (Rakṣas, &c.) at their end, may satiate themselves.


[^2]:  Comp. the similar lists of Āśvalāyana, Gṛhya III, 4; Śāmbavya, quoted in my German edition of Śāṅkhāyana, p.153; and Baudhāyana II, 9 (S.B.E., vol. xiv, pp. 252 seq.). The last seems to be the most modern.


'I satiate the Śruti; I satiate the Smṛti; I satiate the firmness; I satiate the delight; I satiate the success; I satiate the thought; I satiate belief and insight, and the memory, cows and Brāhmaṇas, movable and immovable things. All beings may satiate themselves!' - so far with the sacrificial cord suspended over the left shoulder.
