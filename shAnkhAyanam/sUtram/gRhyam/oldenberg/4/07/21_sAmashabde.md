21 [^6] . When the sound of a Sāman is heard;


[^6]:  The reason why the recitation of the Rig-veda is forbidden when the sound of a Sāman is heard, becomes manifest, for instance, from Āpastamba I, to, 7, where the discontinuance of the Veda-study is prescribed when the barking of dogs, the braying of asses, the cry of a wolf, &c., the sound of musical instruments, of weeping, and of a Sāman is heard. Loud sounds like these would disturb the recitation of Ṛc or Yajus texts. A very curious opinion has been recently brought forward by Professor Aufrecht (see his edition of the Rig-veda, second edition, vol. ii, p. xxxviii) that the incompatibility of the recitation of Ṛc hymns and of Sāmans 'beruht auf der Kenntniss von der Willkür and der zum Theil unwürdigen Weise, in welcher der alte Text des Rig-veda in diesem Gesangbuche (i.e. the Sāmavedārcika) behandelt ist.'
