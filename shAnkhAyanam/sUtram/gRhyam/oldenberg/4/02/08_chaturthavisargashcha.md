8 [^4] . And (then) omission of the fourth one.


[^4]:  After the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha has been performed for a dead person during the first year after his death, he is to be admitted, by the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa ceremony, among the other Manes, and receives thenceforward his Piṇḍa together with them at the ordinary Pārvaṇa Śrāddha. As the ritual of this Śrāddha requires that the number of the 'fathers' worshipped should be three, the accession of a new person makes necessary the omission of the pra-pra-pitāmaha, who has now become fourth among the fathers.
