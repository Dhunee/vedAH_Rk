5 [^3] . No inviting (takes place here), nor the putting (of food) into the fire, nor (do) the Viśve devās (take part in this ceremony). 'Relished?' - thus are they to be asked whether they are satiated. 'May it approach (the fathers),' instead of 'imperishable.'


[^3]:  'Because the āvāhana (inviting) is forbidden here, it follows p. 109 that it must take place at the Pārvaṇa Śrāddha' (Nār.). According to Rāmacandra's Paddhati he shall say to the Brāhmaṇas, 'I will invite hither the fathers;' and when they give their consent, he invites them with Rig-veda X, 16, 12. Comp. Yājñavalkya I, 232 seq., &c. Regarding the Viśve devās comp. the note on chap. 1, 2; as to the tṛptapraśna (the question whether they are satiated) comp. Manu III, 251; Yājñ. I, 240. At the Pārvaṇa Śrāddha, after the Brāhmaṇas have finished their dinner and rinsed their mouths, and after the Piṇḍas have been offered, the sacrificer says, 'May what has been given at this Śrāddha to our father N.N., who belongs to the gotra N.N., be imperishable!' (comp. Yājñ. I, 242.) This phrase is to be altered at the Ekoddiṣṭa Śrāddha in the way indicated in this Sūtra.
