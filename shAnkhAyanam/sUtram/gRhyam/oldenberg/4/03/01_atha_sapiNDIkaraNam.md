1 [^1] . Now (follows) the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa (i.e. reception of a dead person into the community of Piṇḍa-offerings with the other Manes).


[^1]:  3, 1. It appears to me that this whole chapter is a later addition to the original text. The last Sūtra of the preceding chapter, treating of the omission of the fourth 'father,' which forms, as shown in the preceding note, a consequence of the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa, p. 110 supposes this ceremony to be known and to require no special explanation. Had the intention of the author been to treat of the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa, this would have been the right place for mentioning the caturthavisarga, and not, as we really read it, the end of the chapter treating of the Ekoddiṣṭa. As pointing in the same direction I will mention that the Śāmbavya-Gṛhya, while giving the first, second, and fourth chapter of this Adhyāya, omits the third. Finally it seems decisive to me that the fifth (Pariśiṣṭa) book of the Śāṅkhāyana-Gṛhya treats of the Sapiṇḍīkaraṇa in a whole chapter (V, 9), which shows that the text itself, as the author of the Pariśiṣṭa read it, gave no exposition of this ceremony.
