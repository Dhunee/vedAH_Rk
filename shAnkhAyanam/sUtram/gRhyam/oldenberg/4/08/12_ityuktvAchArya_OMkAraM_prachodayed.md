12 [^3] . After (the student) has said, Recite, sir!' the teacher shall cause him to pronounce the syllable OM.


[^3]:  The words adhīhi bho (recite, sir!) are pronounced by the student; this follows from the passages quoted in the note on 1I, 5, 10. Nārāyaṇa states that those words are pronounced by the teacher (ācāryo guruḥ śiṣyam adhyāpanārtham adhīhi bho 3 iti śabdam uktvā . . .).
