9 [^4] . 'That blessing and bliss we choose' - this one verse (the first and last verse of each Maṇḍala).


[^4]:  According to Kauṣītaki, the oblations are made with the first and last ṛcas of each Maṇḍala. The last ṛc of the tenth Maṇḍala quoted here, tac chaṃ yor ā vṛṇīmahe, is different from the verse with which our Saṃhitā (the Śākala Saṃhitā of the Rig-veda) closes. It is well known that tac chaṃ yor ā vṛṇīmahe is the last verse in the Bāṣkala Śākhā which was adopted by the Śāṅkhāyana school (comp. Indische Studien, IV, 431; Weber, Verzeichniss der Berliner Sanskrit-Handschriften, p. 314, &c.; Indische Literaturgeschichte, second edition, Nachtrag, p. 2). It was also known long since that the Bāṣkala Sākhā of the Rig-veda contains eight hymns more than the Śākala Śākhā. The Caraṇavyūha Bhāṣya (comp. Dr. von Schroeder's Introduction to his excellent edition of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā, vol. i, p. xxiv), known to me through the kindness of Professor Weber, tells which eight hymns these are. There it is said (folio 22 of Professor Weber's MS.) that in the Bāṣkala Saṃhitā there followed after VIII, 48 the first two of the Vālakhilya hymns, after VIII, 94 the Vālakhilya hymns 3-7, and at the end of the whole collection the so-called saṃjñāna hymn (see Professor Max Müller's edition, vol. vi, p. 32), which ends with the very verse quoted in our Sūtra, tac chaṃ yor ā vṛṇīmahe.
