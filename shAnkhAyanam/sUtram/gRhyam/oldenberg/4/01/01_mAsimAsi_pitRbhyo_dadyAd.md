1 [^1] . Let him offer (Śrāddha oblations) every month to the fathers.


[^1]:  1, 1. Khaṇḍas 1-4 contain the rules regarding the Śrāddha oblations directed to the Manes. The dinners offered in connection with these Śrāddha sacrifices to Brāhmaṇas and also - though of this of course no notice is taken in Vedic texts - to Śramaṇas stood in the first line among the exhibitions of liberality of lay people towards priests and monks. Thus we find among the stock phrases that constantly reoccur in the Pāli Piṭakas, the mention of Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas 'who have eaten the food given to them out of faith' (saddhādeyyāni bhojanāni bhuñjitvā) - wherein the 'food given out of faith' (saddhādeyya) either chiefly or exclusively means the Śrāddha dinners, which are so called because the sacrificer gives them 'full of faith' (śraddhāsamanvita, Manu III, 275) to the Brāhmaṇas and through them to the Manes.
