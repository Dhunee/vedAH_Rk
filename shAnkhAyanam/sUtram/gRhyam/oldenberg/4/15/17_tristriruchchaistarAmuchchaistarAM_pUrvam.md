17 [^2] . (He repeats these Mantras) thrice each time, the first (part) with higher voice each time,


[^2]:  17, 18. The text has uccaistarām - uccaistarām, and nīcaistarāṃ - nīcaistarām. Nārāyaṇa(comp. the text of his scholion, p. 155 of the German edition) understands this in a different way; he says that in the water-pot mentioned in the fifth Sūtra two different sthānas are to be distinguished, a higher part of it and a lower (uttarādharatayā). Now when the sacrificer, for instance, as prescribed in Sūtra 6, invites the Lord of the celestial Serpents, and the celestial Serpents to wash themselves, the pouring out of water would have to be performed first thrice for the Lord of the celestial Serpents in the higher place, then thrice for the celestial Serpents in the lower place.
