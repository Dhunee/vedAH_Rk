1 [^1] . Now when he intends to set out on a journey, he makes (his sacred) fire enter into himself, (or) into the two kindling sticks, or into (an ordinary) log of wood,


[^1]:  1, 1. The ceremony of Samārohaṇa, by which the duties towards the sacred fire are suspended, by causing the fire to 'enter' into the sacrificer's body, or into the two Araṇis, or into another piece of wood, is already mentioned in several passages of the Brāhmaṇa texts; comp. the quotations given by Professor Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 3r 1. Comp. besides Āśvalāyana-Śrauta-sūtra III 10; Sāṅkhāyana-Śraut. II, 17. The Samārohaṇa into the sacrificer's own body is done by warming the hands at the sacred fire; see Āśv., loc. cit., Sūtra 6. In the Sāṅkhāyana-Śrauta-sūtra the corresponding rule, which regards there of course the Āhitāgni, runs thus, 'If he performs the Samārohaṇa, he warms his hands at the Gārhapatya fire, and then touches his Prāṇas with the words, "Come, enter into my Prāṇas."' On the two other cases, see the Sūtras 3 and 4. Sūtras 2, 3, 5 are taken word for word from the Śrauta-sūtra.
