title = "6. Against enemies: with açvatthá."

## Comment
A very acceptable emendation would be pári jātás, since pári is plainly accessory to the ablative puṁsás, as ádhi to khadirā́t in b (cf. ásatas pári jajñiré, x. 7. 25). Ppp. retains the initial a of açvatthas, and begins d with yāṅç cā ’ham. The açvattha begins as a parasite, usually on the çamī (fem.), this time from the hard khadira (masc).
