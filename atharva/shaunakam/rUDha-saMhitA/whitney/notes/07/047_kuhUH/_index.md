## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx. Further, in TS. iii. 3. 115, MS. iv. 12. 6, K. xiii. 16, AÇS. i. 10. 8, ÇÇS. ix. 28. 3. This hymn, with the preceding (or also 48 and 49?) and hymn 6, makes up (Kāuç. 59. 18, note), according to the schol., a patnīvantagaṇa (not acknowledged nor used in the Kāuç. text). In Vāit. (i. 16), it and hymn 48, paired respectively with 79 and 80, are used on the days of new and full moon at the parvan sacrifices.
