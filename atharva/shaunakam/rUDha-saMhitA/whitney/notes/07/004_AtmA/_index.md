## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xx., and in a series of other texts: VS. (xxvii. 33), ÇB. (iv. 4. 115), MS. (iv. 6. 2), TA. (i. ii. 821), AÇS. (v. 18. 5), ÇÇS. (viii. 3. 10). Kāuç. (41. 26) teaches the repetition of the verse three times at the end of a rite for the benefit of a horse; and Vāit. (9. 27: misunderstood by the editor) applies it with an oblation to Vāyu at the cāturmāsya sacrifice.
