title = "89. To win affection."

## Comment
This hymn also, like the preceding, is wanting in Pāipp. Kāuç. (36. 10-11) applies it in a women's rite, for winning affection, addressing the head and ear, or wearing the hair, of the person to be affected. *⌊The Anukr. text is confused here; but the Berlin ms. seems to add manyuvināçanam.⌋
