## Comment
Found also in Pāipp. xix., and in the Çrāuta-Sūtras of Āçvalāyana (viii. 11.4) and Çān̄khāyana (x. 9. 17); the first verse, further, in VS. and MS. This hymn and the one following are called by Kāuç. (31. 5) vāiçvānarīya, and used in a general remedial rite; and verse 35. 2 is reckoned (note to 32. 27) to the aṅholin̄ga gaṇa. In Vāit, hymn 35 appears alone in the agnicayana (29. 5), with i. 21 and vii. 84, accompanying the covering of the first courses of bricks.
