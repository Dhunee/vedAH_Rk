An important part of Atharvavedic initiation is the preparation of Shanti waters. Atharvan herbs are collected and put in water pot and with Japa of AV mantras shantyudaka is prepared. Shantyudaka is employed not just in initiation but all atharvanic rituals.

An elaborate form of initiation begins with construction of shAlA and preparing a mandala in which atharvan deities are invoked.

- The mandala in red cloth is on North West. From right to left, 16 matrikas in a grid if 4x4 and rAtrI Devi are invoked. On North East, on white cloth, navagrahas, mitAdi - set of deities including, bhrigu, angiras and paippalada, 8 nAgas with varaha in center
- Ganesha and ambika below the Naga group
